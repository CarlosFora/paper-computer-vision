### 1.SqueezeNAS: Fast neural architecture search for faster semantic segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01748.pdf)
>  For real time applications utilizing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), it is critical that the models achieve high-accuracy on the target task and low-latency inference on the target computing platform. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been effectively used to develop low-latency networks for image classification, there has been relatively little effort to use NAS to optimize DNN architectures for other vision tasks. In this work, we present what we believe to be the first proxyless hardware-aware search targeted for dense semantic segmentation. With this approach, we advance the state-of-the-art accuracy for latency-optimized networks on the Cityscapes semantic segmentation dataset. Our latency-optimized small SqueezeNAS network achieves 68.02% validation class mIOU with less than 35 ms inference times on the NVIDIA AGX Xavier. Our latency-optimized large SqueezeNAS network achieves 73.62% class mIOU with less than 100 ms inference times. We demonstrate that significant performance gains are possible by utilizing NAS to find networks optimized for both the specific task and inference hardware. We also present detailed analysis comparing our networks to recent state-of-the-art architectures. 
### 2.Visual-Relation Conscious Image Generation from Structured-Text  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01741.pdf)
>  Generating realistic images from text descriptions is a challenging problem and has many applications such as image editing or computer-aided design. In spite of recent progress on this text-to-image generation based on GANs, generating realistic images from complex descriptions with many entities in a general scene is not yet achieved in the literature. In the presence of multiple entities, the relationships between entities become important because they condition the location of each entity. We propose a GAN-based end-to-end network that learns the visual-relation layout between entities from given texts and conditions the layout in generating images. Our proposed network consists of the visual-relation layout module and the stacking-GANs. The visual-relation layout module predicts bounding-boxes for all the entities given in an input text so that each of them uniquely corresponds to each entity while keeping its involved relationships. The visual-relation layout is obtained by aggregating all the bounding-boxes, reflecting the scene structure given in text. The stacking-GANs is the stack of three GANs conditioned on the output of previous GAN and the visual-relation layout, consistently capturing the scene structure. Our network realistically renders entities' details in high resolution while keeping the scene structure. Experimental results on two public datasets show outperformances of our method against state-of-the-art methods. 
### 3.Learning a Unified Embedding for Visual Search at Pinterest  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01707.pdf)
>  At Pinterest, we utilize image embeddings throughout our search and recommendation systems to help our users navigate through visual content by powering experiences like browsing of related content and searching for exact products for shopping. In this work we describe a multi-task deep metric learning system to learn a single unified image embedding which can be used to power our multiple visual search products. The solution we present not only allows us to train for multiple application objectives in a single deep neural network architecture, but takes advantage of correlated information in the combination of all training data from each application to generate a unified embedding that outperforms all specialized embeddings previously deployed for each product. We discuss the challenges of handling images from different domains such as camera photos, high quality web images, and clean product catalog images. We also detail how to jointly train for multiple product objectives and how to leverage both engagement data and human labeled data. In addition, our trained embeddings can also be binarized for efficient storage and retrieval without compromising precision and recall. Through comprehensive evaluations on offline metrics, user studies, and online A/B experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed unified embedding improves both relevance and engagement of our visual search products for both browsing and searching purposes when compared to existing specialized embeddings. Finally, the deployment of the unified embedding at Pinterest has drastically reduced the operation and engineering cost of maintaining multiple embeddings while improving quality. 
### 4.SESF-Fuse: An Unsupervised Deep Model for Multi-Focus Image Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01703.pdf)
>  In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning model to address multi-focus image fusion problem. First, we train an encoder-decoder network in unsupervised manner to acquire deep feature of input images. And then we utilize these features and spatial frequency to measure activity level and decision map. Finally, we apply some consistency verification methods to adjust the decision map and draw out fused result. The key point behind of proposed method is that only the objects within the depth-of-field (DOF) have sharp appearance in the photograph while other objects are likely to be blurred. In contrast to previous works, our method analyzes sharp appearance in deep feature instead of original image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-art fusion performance compared to existing 16 fusion methods in objective and subjective assessment. 
### 5.Spatially and Temporally Efficient Non-local Attention Network for Video-based Person Re-Identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01683.pdf)
>  Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at matching video sequences of pedestrians across non-overlapping cameras. It is a practical yet challenging task of how to embed spatial and temporal information of a video into its feature representation. While most existing methods learn the video characteristics by aggregating image-wise features and designing attention mechanisms in Neural Networks, they only explore the correlation between frames at high-level features. In this work, we target at refining the intermediate features as well as high-level features with non-local attention operations and make two contributions. (i) We propose a Non-local Video Attention Network (NVAN) to incorporate video characteristics into the representation at multiple feature levels. (ii) We further introduce a Spatially and Temporally Efficient Non-local Video Attention Network (STE-NVAN) to reduce the computation complexity by exploring spatial and temporal redundancy presented in pedestrian videos. Extensive experiments show that our NVAN outperforms state-of-the-arts by 3.8% in rank-1 accuracy on MARS dataset and confirms our STE-NVAN displays a much superior computation footprint compared to existing methods. 
### 6.Model Decay in Long-Term Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01603.pdf)
>  Updating the tracker model with adverse bounding box predictions adds an unavoidable bias term to the learning. This bias term, which we refer to as model decay, offsets the learning and causes tracking drift. While its adverse affect might not be visible in short-term tracking, accumulation of this bias over a long-term can eventually lead to a permanent loss of the target. In this paper, we look at the problem of model bias from a mathematical perspective. Further, we briefly examine the effect of various sources of tracking error on model decay, using a correlation filter (ECO) and a Siamese (SINT) tracker. Based on observations and insights, we propose simple additions that help to reduce model decay in long-term tracking. The proposed tracker is evaluated on four long-term and one short term tracking benchmarks, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness, even in 30 minute long videos. 
### 7.Revisiting Feature Alignment for One-stage Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01570.pdf)
>  Recently, one-stage object detectors gain much attention due to their simplicity in practice. Its fully convolutional nature greatly reduces the difficulty of training and deployment compared with two-stage detectors which require NMS and sorting for the proposal stage. However, a fundamental issue lies in all one-stage detectors is the misalignment between anchor boxes and convolutional features, which significantly hinders the performance of one-stage detectors. In this work, we first reveal the deep connection between the widely used im2col operator and the RoIAlign operator. Guided by this illuminating observation, we propose a RoIConv operator which aligns the features and its corresponding anchors in one-stage detection in a principled way. We then design a fully convolutional AlignDet architecture which combines the flexibility of learned anchors and the preciseness of aligned features. Specifically, our AlignDet achieves a state-of-the-art mAP of 44.1 on the COCO test-dev with ResNeXt-101 backbone. 
### 8.3D Reconstruction of Deformable Revolving Object under Heavy Hand Interaction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01523.pdf)
>  We reconstruct 3D deformable object through time, in the context of a live pottery making process where the crafter molds the object. Because the object suffers from heavy hand interaction, and is being deformed, classical techniques cannot be applied. We use particle energy optimization to estimate the object profile and benefit of the object radial symmetry to increase the robustness of the reconstruction to both occlusion and noise. Our method works with an unconstrained scalable setup with one or more depth sensors. We evaluate on our database (released upon publication) on a per-frame and temporal basis and shows it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art achieving 7.60mm average object reconstruction error. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 
### 9.Adversarial Self-Defense for Cycle-Consistent GANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01517.pdf)
>  The goal of unsupervised image-to-image translation is to map images from one domain to another without the ground truth correspondence between the two domains. State-of-art methods learn the correspondence using large numbers of unpaired examples from both domains and are based on generative adversarial networks. In order to preserve the semantics of the input image, the adversarial objective is usually combined with a cycle-consistency loss that penalizes incorrect reconstruction of the input image from the translated one. However, if the target mapping is many-to-one, e.g. aerial photos to maps, such a restriction forces the generator to hide information in low-amplitude structured noise that is undetectable by human eye or by the discriminator. In this paper, we show how such self-attacking behavior of unsupervised translation methods affects their performance and provide two defense techniques. We perform a quantitative evaluation of the proposed techniques and show that making the translation model more robust to the self-adversarial attack increases its generation quality and reconstruction reliability and makes the model less sensitive to low-amplitude perturbations. 
### 10.A Fast Content-Based Image Retrieval Method Using Deep Visual Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01505.pdf)
>  Fast and scalable Content-Based Image Retrieval using visual features is required for document analysis, Medical image analysis, etc. in the present age. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) activations as features achieved their outstanding performance in this area. Deep Convolutional representations using the softmax function in the output layer are also ones among visual features. However, almost all the image retrieval systems hold their index of visual features on main memory in order to high responsiveness, limiting their applicability for big data applications. In this paper, we propose a fast calculation method of cosine similarity with L2 norm indexed in advance on Elasticsearch. We evaluate our approach with ImageNet Dataset and VGG-16 pre-trained model. The evaluation results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. 
### 11.Part Segmentation for Highly Accurate Deformable Tracking in Occlusions via Fully Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01504.pdf)
>  Successfully tracking the human body is an important perceptual challenge for robots that must work around people. Existing methods fall into two broad categories: geometric tracking and direct pose estimation using machine learning. While recent work has shown direct estimation techniques can be quite powerful, geometric tracking methods using point clouds can provide a very high level of 3D accuracy which is necessary for many robotic applications. However these approaches can have difficulty in clutter when large portions of the subject are occluded. To overcome this limitation, we propose a solution based on fully convolutional neural networks (FCN). We develop an optimized Fast-FCN network architecture for our application which allows us to filter observed point clouds and improve tracking accuracy while maintaining interactive frame rates. We also show that this model can be trained with a limited number of examples and almost no manual labelling by using an existing geometric tracker and data augmentation to automatically generate segmentation maps. We demonstrate the accuracy of our full system by comparing it against an existing geometric tracker, and show significant improvement in these challenging scenarios. 
### 12.Pixel2Mesh++: Multi-View 3D Mesh Generation via Deformation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01491.pdf)
>  We study the problem of shape generation in 3D mesh representation from a few color images with known camera poses. While many previous works learn to hallucinate the shape directly from priors, we resort to further improving the shape quality by leveraging cross-view information with a graph convolutional network. Instead of building a direct mapping function from images to 3D shape, our model learns to predict series of deformations to improve a coarse shape iteratively. Inspired by traditional multiple view geometry methods, our network samples nearby area around the initial mesh's vertex locations and reasons an optimal deformation using perceptual feature statistics built from multiple input images. Extensive experiments show that our model produces accurate 3D shape that are not only visually plausible from the input perspectives, but also well aligned to arbitrary viewpoints. With the help of physically driven architecture, our model also exhibits generalization capability across different semantic categories, number of input images, and quality of mesh initialization. 
### 13.Walking with MIND: Mental Imagery eNhanceD Embodied QA  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01482.pdf)
>  The EmbodiedQA is a task of training an embodied agent by intelligently navigating in a simulated environment and gathering visual information to answer questions. Existing approaches fail to explicitly model the mental imagery function of the agent, while the mental imagery is crucial to embodied cognition, and has a close relation to many high-level meta-skills such as generalization and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel Mental Imagery eNhanceD (MIND) module for the embodied agent, as well as a relevant deep reinforcement framework for training. The MIND module can not only model the dynamics of the environment (e.g. 'what might happen if the agent passes through a door') but also help the agent to create a better understanding of the environment (e.g. 'The refrigerator is usually in the kitchen'). Such knowledge makes the agent a faster and better learner in locating a feasible policy with only a few trails. Furthermore, the MIND module can generate mental images that are treated as short-term subgoals by our proposed deep reinforcement framework. These mental images facilitate policy learning since short-term subgoals are easy to achieve and reusable. This yields better planning efficiency than other algorithms that learn a policy directly from primitive actions. Finally, the mental images visualize the agent's intentions in a way that human can understand, and this endows our agent's actions with more interpretability. The experimental results and further analysis prove that the agent with the MIND module is superior to its counterparts not only in EQA performance but in many other aspects such as route planning, behavioral interpretation, and the ability to generalize from a few examples. 
### 14.GDRQ: Group-based Distribution Reshaping for Quantization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01477.pdf)
>  Low-bit quantization is challenging to maintain high performance with limited model capacity (e.g., 4-bit for both weights and activations). Naturally, the distribution of both weights and activations in deep neural network are Gaussian-like. Nevertheless, due to the limited bitwidth of low-bit model, uniform-like distributed weights and activations have been proved to be more friendly to quantization while preserving accuracy~\cite{Han2015Learning}. Motivated by this, we propose Scale-Clip, a Distribution Reshaping technique that can reshape weights or activations into a uniform-like distribution in a dynamic manner. Furthermore, to increase the model capability for a low-bit model, a novel Group-based Quantization algorithm is proposed to split the filters into several groups. Different groups can learn different quantization parameters, which can be elegantly merged in to batch normalization layer without extra computational cost in the inference stage. Finally, we integrate Scale-Clip technique with Group-based Quantization algorithm and propose the Group-based Distribution Reshaping Quantization (GDQR) framework to further improve the quantization performance. Experiments on various networks (e.g. VGGNet and ResNet) and vision tasks (e.g. classification, detection and segmentation) demonstrate that our framework achieves good performance. 
### 15.Automated Detection System for Adversarial Examples with High-Frequency Noises Sieve  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01469.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks are being applied in many tasks with encouraging results, and have often reached human-level performance. However, deep neural networks are vulnerable to well-designed input samples called adversarial examples. In particular, neural networks tend to misclassify adversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans. This paper introduces a new detection system that automatically detects adversarial examples on deep neural networks. Our proposed system can mostly distinguish adversarial samples and benign images in an end-to-end manner without human intervention. We exploit the important role of the frequency domain in adversarial samples and propose a method that detects malicious samples in observations. When evaluated on two standard benchmark datasets (MNIST and ImageNet), our method achieved an out-detection rate of 99.7 - 100% in many settings. 
### 16.TopoTag: A Robust and Scalable Topological Fiducial Marker System  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01450.pdf)
>  Fiducial markers have been playing an important role in augmented reality (AR), robot navigation, and general applications where the relative pose between a camera and an object is required. We introduce TopoTag, a robust and scalable topological fiducial marker system, which supports reliable and accurate pose estimation from a single image. TopoTag uses topological and geometrical information in marker detection to achieve higher robustness. Without sacrificing bits for higher recall and precision like previous systems, TopoTag can use full bits for ID encoding and supports tens of thousands unique IDs and easily extends to millions and more by adding more bits, thus achieves perfect scalability. We collect a large dataset including in total 169,713 images for evaluation, involving in-plane and out-of-plane rotation, image blur, different distances and various backgrounds, etc. Experiments show that TopoTag significantly outperforms previous fiducial marker systems in terms of various metrics, including detection accuracy, vertex jitter, pose jitter and accuracy, etc. In addition, TopoTag supports occlusion as long as main tag topological structure is maintained and flexible shape design where users can customize inter and outer marker shapes. Our dataset, marker design and detection algorithm are public to the community. 
### 17.Image to Video Domain Adaptation Using Web Supervision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01449.pdf)
>  Training deep neural networks typically requires large amounts of labeled data which may be scarce or expensive to obtain for a particular target domain. As an alternative, we can leverage webly-supervised data (i.e. results from a public search engine) which are relatively plentiful but may contain noisy results. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage approach to learn a video classifier using webly-supervised data. We argue that learning appearance features and then temporal features sequentially, rather than simultaneously, is an easier optimization for this task. We show this by first learning an image model from web images, which is used to initialize and train a video model. Our model applies domain adaptation to account for potential domain shift present between the source domain (webly-supervised data) and target domain and also accounts for noise by adding a novel attention component. We report results competitive with state-of-the-art for webly-supervised approaches on UCF-101 (while simplifying the training process) and also evaluate on Kinetics for comparison. 
### 18.Learning Compact Target-Oriented Feature Representations for Visual Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01442.pdf)
>  Many state-of-the-art trackers usually resort to the pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model for correlation filtering, in which deep features could usually be redundant, noisy and less discriminative for some certain instances, and the tracking performance might thus be affected. To handle this problem, we propose a novel approach, which takes both advantages of good generalization of generative models and excellent discrimination of discriminative models, for visual tracking. In particular, we learn compact, discriminative and target-oriented feature representations using the Laplacian coding algorithm that exploits the dependence among the input local features in a discriminative correlation filter framework. The feature representations and the correlation filter are jointly learnt to enhance to each other via a fast solver which only has very slight computational burden on the tracking speed. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that this proposed framework clearly outperforms baseline trackers with a modest impact on the frame rate, and performs comparably against the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 19.Inference of visual field test performance from OCT volumes using deep learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01428.pdf)
>  Visual field tests (VFT) are pivotal for glaucoma diagnosis and conducted regularly to monitor disease progression. Here we address the question to what degree aggregate VFT measurements such as Visual Field Index (VFI) and Mean Deviation (MD) can be inferred from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans of the Optic Nerve Head (ONH) or the macula. Accurate inference of VFT measurements from OCT could reduce examination time and cost. <br>We propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for this task and compare its accuracy with classical machine learning (ML) algorithms trained on common, segmentation-based OCT, features employed for glaucoma diagnostics. <br>Peak accuracies were achieved on ONH scans when inferring VFI with a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.88$\pm$0.035 for the CNN and a significantly lower (p $&lt;$ 0.01) PC of 0.74$\pm$0.090 for the best performing, classical ML algorithm -- a Random Forest regressor. Estimation of MD was equally accurate with a PC of 0.88$\pm$0.023 on ONH scans for the CNN. 
### 20.Deep Neural Network for Semantic-based Text Recognition in Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01403.pdf)
>  State-of-the-art text spotting systems typically aim to detect isolated words or word-by-word text in images of natural scenes and ignore the semantic coherence within a region of text. However, when interpreted together, seemingly isolated words may be easier to recognize. On this basis, we propose a novel "semantic-based text recognition" (STR) deep learning model that reads text in images with the help of understanding context. STR consists of several modules. We introduce the Text Grouping and Arranging (TGA) algorithm to connect and order isolated text regions. A text-recognition network interprets isolated words. Benefiting from semantic information, a sequenceto-sequence network model efficiently corrects inaccurate and uncertain phrases produced earlier in the STR pipeline. We present experiments on two new distinct datasets that contain scanned catalog images of interior designs and photographs of protesters with hand-written signs, respectively. Our results show that our STR model outperforms a baseline method that uses state-of-the-art single-wordrecognition techniques on both datasets. STR yields a high accuracy rate of 90% on the catalog images and 71% on the more difficult protest images, suggesting its generality in recognizing text. 
### 21.Image-Guided Depth Sampling and Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01379.pdf)
>  Depth acquisition, based on active illumination, is essential for autonomous and robotic navigation. LiDARs (Light Detection And Ranging) with mechanical, fixed, sampling templates are commonly used in today's autonomous vehicles. An emerging technology, based on solid-state depth sensors, with no mechanical parts, allows fast, adaptive, programmable scans. <br>In this paper, we investigate the topic of adaptive, image-driven, sampling and reconstruction strategies. First, we formulate a piece-wise linear depth model with several tolerance parameters and estimate its validity for indoor and outdoor scenes. Our model and experiments predict that, in the optimal case, about 20-60 piece-wise linear structures can approximate well a depth map. This translates to a depth-to-image sampling ratio of about 1/1200. We propose a simple, generic, sampling and reconstruction algorithm, based on super-pixels. We reach a sampling rate which is still far from the optimal case. However, our sampling improves grid and random sampling, consistently, for a wide variety of reconstruction methods. Moreover, our proposed reconstruction achieves state-of-the-art results, compared to image-guided depth completion algorithms, reducing the required sampling rate by a factor of 3-4. A single-pixel depth camera built in our lab illustrates the concept. 
### 22.Unsupervised Learning of Depth and Deep Representation for Visual Odometry from Monocular Videos in a Metric Space  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01367.pdf)
>  For ego-motion estimation, the feature representation of the scenes is crucial. Previous methods indicate that both the low-level and semantic feature-based methods can achieve promising results. Therefore, the incorporation of hierarchical feature representation may benefit from both methods. From this perspective, we propose a novel direct feature odometry framework, named DFO, for depth estimation and hierarchical feature representation learning from monocular videos. By exploiting the metric distance, our framework is able to learn the hierarchical feature representation without supervision. The pose is obtained with a coarse-to-fine approach from high-level to low-level features in enlarged feature maps. The pixel-level attention mask can be self-learned to provide the prior information. In contrast to the previous methods, our proposed method calculates the camera motion with a direct method rather than regressing the ego-motion from the pose network. With this approach, the consistency of the scale factor of translation can be constrained. Additionally, the proposed method is thus compatible with the traditional SLAM pipeline. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 
### 23.SF-Net: Structured Feature Network for Continuous Sign Language Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01341.pdf)
>  Continuous sign language recognition (SLR) aims to translate a signing sequence into a sentence. It is very challenging as sign language is rich in vocabulary, while many among them contain similar gestures and motions. Moreover, it is weakly supervised as the alignment of signing glosses is not available. In this paper, we propose Structured Feature Network (SF-Net) to address these challenges by effectively learn multiple levels of semantic information in the data. The proposed SF-Net extracts features in a structured manner and gradually encodes information at the frame level, the gloss level and the sentence level into the feature representation. The proposed SF-Net can be trained end-to-end without the help of other models or pre-training. We tested the proposed SF-Net on two large scale public SLR datasets collected from different continuous SLR scenarios. Results show that the proposed SF-Net clearly outperforms previous sequence level supervision based methods in terms of both accuracy and adaptability. 
### 24.ARGAN: Attentive Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network for Shadow Detection and Removal  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01323.pdf)
>  In this paper we propose an attentive recurrent generative adversarial network (ARGAN) to detect and remove shadows in an image. The generator consists of multiple progressive steps. At each step a shadow attention detector is firstly exploited to generate an attention map which specifies shadow regions in the input image.Given the attention map, a negative residual by a shadow remover encoder will recover a shadow-lighter or even a shadow-free image. A discriminator is designed to classify whether the output image in the last progressive step is real or fake. Moreover, ARGAN is suitable to be trained with a semi-supervised strategy to make full use of sufficient unsupervised data. The experiments on four public datasets have demonstrated that our ARGAN is robust to detect both simple and complex shadows and to produce more realistic shadow removal results. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially in detail of recovering shadow areas. 
### 25.Low-Rank Pairwise Alignment Bilinear Network For Few-Shot Fine-Grained Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01313.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks have demonstrated advanced abilities on various visual classification tasks, which heavily rely on the large-scale training samples with annotated ground-truth. However, it is unrealistic always to require such annotation in real-world applications. Recently, Few-Shot learning (FS), as an attempt to address the shortage of training samples, has made significant progress in generic classification tasks. Nonetheless, it is still challenging for current FS models to distinguish the subtle differences between fine-grained categories given limited training data. To filling the classification gap, in this paper, we address the Few-Shot Fine-Grained (FSFG) classification problem, which focuses on tackling the fine-grained classification under the challenging few-shot learning setting. A novel low-rank pairwise bilinear pooling operation is proposed to capture the nuanced differences between the support and query images for learning an effective distance metric. Moreover, a feature alignment layer is designed to match the support image features with query ones before the comparison. We name the proposed model Low-Rank Pairwise Alignment Bilinear Network (LRPABN), which is trained in an end-to-end fashion. Comprehensive experimental results on four widely used fine-grained classification datasets demonstrate that our LRPABN model achieves the superior performances compared to state-of-the-art methods. 
### 26.Fully Automatic Video Colorization with Self-Regularization and Diversity  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01311.pdf)
>  We present a fully automatic approach to video colorization with self-regularization and diversity. Our model contains a colorization network for video frame colorization and a refinement network for spatiotemporal color refinement. Without any labeled data, both networks can be trained with self-regularized losses defined in bilateral and temporal space. The bilateral loss enforces color consistency between neighboring pixels in a bilateral space and the temporal loss imposes constraints between corresponding pixels in two nearby frames. While video colorization is a multi-modal problem, our method uses a perceptual loss with diversity to differentiate various modes in the solution space. Perceptual experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on fully automatic video colorization. The results are shown in the supplementary video at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://youtu.be/Y15uv2jnK-4" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> 
### 27.Theme Aware Aesthetic Distribution Prediction with Full Resolution Photos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01308.pdf)
>  Aesthetic quality assessment (AQA) of photos is a challenging task due to the subjective and diverse factors in human assessment process. Nowadays, it is common to tackle AQA with deep neural networks (DNNs) for their superior performance on modeling such complex relations. However, traditional DNNs require fix-sized inputs, and resizing various inputs to a uniform size may significantly change their aesthetic features. Such transformations lead to the mismatches between photos and their aesthetic evaluations. Existing methods usually adopt two solutions for it. Some methods directly crop fix-sized patches from the inputs. The others alternately capture the aesthetic features from pre-defined multi-size inputs by inserting adaptive pooling or removing fully connected layers. However, the former destroys the global structures and layout information, which are crucial in most situations. The latter has to resize images into several pre-defined sizes, which is not enough to reflect the diversity of image sizes, and the aesthetic features are still destroyed. To address this issue, we propose a simple and effective method that can handle the arbitrary sizes of batch inputs to achieve AQA on the full resolution images by combining image padding with ROI (region of interest) pooling. Padding keeps inputs of the same size, while ROI pooling cuts off the forward propagation of features on padding regions, thus eliminates the side effects of padding. Besides, we observe that the same image may receive different scores under different themes, which we call the theme criterion bias. However, previous works only focus on the aesthetic features of the images and ignore the criterion bias brought by their themes. In this paper, we introduce the theme information and propose a theme aware model. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-arts. 
### 28.Adversarial View-Consistent Learning for Monocular Depth Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01301.pdf)
>  This paper addresses the problem of Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE). Existing approaches on MDE usually model it as a pixel-level regression problem, ignoring the underlying geometry property. We empirically find this may result in sub-optimal solution: while the predicted depth map presents small loss value in one specific view, it may exhibit large loss if viewed in different directions. In this paper, inspired by multi-view stereo (MVS), we propose an Adversarial View-Consistent Learning (AVCL) framework to force the estimated depth map to be all reasonable viewed from multiple views. To this end, we first design a differentiable depth map warping operation, which is end-to-end trainable, and then propose a pose generator to generate novel views for a given image in an adversarial manner. Collaborating with the differentiable depth map warping operation, the pose generator encourages the depth estimation network to learn from hard views, hence produce view-consistent depth maps . We evaluate our method on NYU Depth V2 dataset and the experimental results show promising performance gain upon state-of-the-art MDE approaches. 
### 29.To Learn or Not to Learn: Visual Localization from Essential Matrices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01293.pdf)
>  Visual localization is the problem of estimating a camera within a scene and a key component in computer vision applications such as self-driving cars and Mixed Reality. State-of-the-art approaches for accurate visual localization use scene-specific representations, resulting in the overhead of constructing these models when applying the techniques to new scenes. Recently, deep learning-based approaches based on relative pose estimation have been proposed, carrying the promise of easily adapting to new scenes. However, it has been shown such approaches are currently significantly less accurate than state-of-the-art approaches. In this paper, we are interested in analyzing this behavior. To this end, we propose a novel framework for visual localization from relative poses. Using a classical feature-based approach within this framework, we show state-of-the-art performance. Replacing the classical approach with learned alternatives at various levels, we then identify the reasons for why deep learned approaches do not perform well. Based on our analysis, we make recommendations for future work. 
### 30.Softmax Dissection: Towards Understanding Intra- and Inter-clas Objective for Embedding Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01281.pdf)
>  The softmax loss and its variants are widely used as objectives for embedding learning, especially in applications like face recognition. However, the intra- and inter-class objectives in the softmax loss are entangled, therefore a well-optimized inter-class objective leads to relaxation on the intra-class objective, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose to dissect the softmax loss into independent intra- and inter-class objective (D-Softmax). With D-Softmax as objective, we can have a clear understanding of both the intra- and inter-class objective, therefore it is straightforward to tune each part to the best state. Furthermore, we find the computation of the inter-class objective is redundant and propose two sampling-based variants of D-Softmax to reduce the computation cost. Training with regular-scale data, experiments in face verification show D-Softmax is favorably comparable to existing losses such as SphereFace and ArcFace. Training with massive-scale data, experiments show the fast variants of D-Softmax significantly accelerates the training process (such as 64x) with only a minor sacrifice in performance, outperforming existing acceleration methods of softmax in terms of both performance and efficiency. 
### 31.Robust Subspace Discovery by Block-diagonal Adaptive Locality-constrained Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01266.pdf)
>  We propose a novel and unsupervised representation learning model, i.e., Robust Block-Diagonal Adaptive Locality-constrained Latent Representation (rBDLR). rBDLR is able to recover multi-subspace structures and extract the adaptive locality-preserving salient features jointly. Leveraging on the Frobenius-norm based latent low-rank representation model, rBDLR jointly learns the coding coefficients and salient features, and improves the results by enhancing the robustness to outliers and errors in given data, preserving local information of salient features adaptively and ensuring the block-diagonal structures of the coefficients. To improve the robustness, we perform the latent representation and adaptive weighting in a recovered clean data space. To force the coefficients to be block-diagonal, we perform auto-weighting by minimizing the reconstruction error based on salient features, constrained using a block-diagonal regularizer. This ensures that a strict block-diagonal weight matrix can be obtained and salient features will possess the adaptive locality preserving ability. By minimizing the difference between the coefficient and weights matrices, we can obtain a block-diagonal coefficients matrix and it can also propagate and exchange useful information between salient features and coefficients. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of rBDLR over other state-of-the-art methods. 
### 32.Attentive Normalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01259.pdf)
>  Batch Normalization (BN) is a vital pillar in the development of deep learning with many recent variations such as Group Normalization (GN) and Switchable Normalization. Channel-wise feature attention methods such as the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) unit have also shown impressive performance improvement. BN and its variants take into account different ways of computing the mean and variance within a min-batch for feature normalization, followed by a learnable channel-wise affine transformation. SE explicitly learns how to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses. They have been studied separately, however. In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight integration of feature normalization and feature channel-wise attention. We present Attentive Normalization (AN) as a simple and unified alternative. AN absorbs SE into the affine transformation of BN. AN learns a small number of scale and offset parameters per channel (i.e., different affine transformations). Their weighted sums (i.e., mixture) are used in the final affine transformation. The weights are instance-specific and learned in a way that channel-wise attention is considered, similar in spirit to the squeeze module in the SE unit. AN is complementary and applicable to existing variants of BN. In experiments, we test AN in the ImageNet-1K classification dataset and the MS-COCO object detection and instance segmentation dataset with significantly better performance obtained than the vanilla BN. Our AN also outperforms two state-of-the-art variants of BN, GN and SN. The source code will be released at \url{<a class="link-external link-http" href="http://github.com/ivMCL/AttentiveNorm" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a>}. 
### 33.Kannada-MNIST: A new handwritten digits dataset for the Kannada language  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01242.pdf)
>  In this paper, we disseminate a new handwritten digits-dataset, termed Kannada-MNIST, for the Kannada script, that can potentially serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset. In addition to this dataset, we disseminate an additional real world handwritten dataset (with $10k$ images), which we term as the Dig-MNIST dataset that can serve as an out-of-domain test dataset. We also duly open source all the code as well as the raw scanned images along with the scanner settings so that researchers who want to try out different signal processing pipelines can perform end-to-end comparisons. We provide high level morphological comparisons with the MNIST dataset and provide baselines accuracies for the dataset disseminated. The initial baselines obtained using an oft-used CNN architecture ($96.8\%$ for the main test-set and $76.1\%$ for the Dig-MNIST test-set) indicate that these datasets do provide a sterner challenge with regards to generalizability than MNIST or the KMNIST datasets. We also hope this dissemination will spur the creation of similar datasets for all the languages that use different symbols for the numeral digits. 
### 34.Learning Guided Convolutional Network for Depth Completion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01238.pdf)
>  Dense depth perception is critical for autonomous driving and other robotics applications. However, modern LiDAR sensors only provide sparse depth measurement. It is thus necessary to complete the sparse LiDAR data, where a synchronized guidance RGB image is often used to facilitate this completion. Many neural networks have been designed for this task. However, they often na\"{\i}vely fuse the LiDAR data and RGB image information by performing feature concatenation or element-wise addition. Inspired by the guided image filtering, we design a novel guided network to predict kernel weights from the guidance image. These predicted kernels are then applied to extract the depth image features. In this way, our network generates content-dependent and spatially-variant kernels for multi-modal feature fusion. Dynamically generated spatially-variant kernels could lead to prohibitive GPU memory consumption and computation overhead. We further design a convolution factorization to reduce computation and memory consumption. The GPU memory reduction makes it possible for feature fusion to work in multi-stage scheme. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify our method on real-world outdoor, indoor and synthetic datasets. Our method produces strong results. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the NYUv2 dataset and ranks 1st on the KITTI depth completion benchmark at the time of submission. It also presents strong generalization capability under different 3D point densities, various lighting and weather conditions as well as cross-dataset evaluations. The code will be released for reproduction. 
### 35.Smooth Grad-CAM++: An Enhanced Inference Level Visualization Technique for Deep Convolutional Neural Network Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01224.pdf)
>  Gaining insight into how deep convolutional neural network models perform image classification and how to explain their outputs have been a concern to computer vision researchers and decision makers. These deep models are often referred to as black box due to low comprehension of their internal workings. As an effort to developing explainable deep learning models, several methods have been proposed such as finding gradients of class output with respect to input image (sensitivity maps), class activation map (CAM), and Gradient based Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAM). These methods under perform when localizing multiple occurrences of the same class and do not work for all CNNs. In addition, Grad-CAM does not capture the entire object in completeness when used on single object images, this affect performance on recognition tasks. With the intention to create an enhanced visual explanation in terms of visual sharpness, object localization and explaining multiple occurrences of objects in a single image, we present Smooth Grad-CAM++ \footnote{Simple demo: <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://35.238.22.135:5000/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a>}, a technique that combines methods from two other recent techniques---SMOOTHGRAD and Grad-CAM++. Our Smooth Grad-CAM++ technique provides the capability of either visualizing a layer, subset of feature maps, or subset of neurons within a feature map at each instance at the inference level (model prediction process). After experimenting with few images, Smooth Grad-CAM++ produced more visually sharp maps with better localization of objects in the given input images when compared with other methods. 
### 36.Learning to Predict 3D Objects with an Interpolation-based Differentiable Renderer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01210.pdf)
>  Many machine learning models operate on images, but ignore the fact that images are 2D projections formed by 3D geometry interacting with light, in a process called rendering. Enabling ML models to understand image formation might be key for generalization. However, due to an essential rasterization step involving discrete assignment operations, rendering pipelines are non-differentiable and thus largely inaccessible to gradient-based ML techniques. In this paper, we present DIB-R, a differentiable rendering framework which allows gradients to be analytically computed for all pixels in an image. Key to our approach is to view foreground rasterization as a weighted interpolation of local properties and background rasterization as an distance-based aggregation of global geometry. Our approach allows for accurate optimization over vertex positions, colors, normals, light directions and texture coordinates through a variety of lighting models. We showcase our approach in two ML applications: single-image 3D object prediction, and 3D textured object generation, both trained using exclusively using 2D supervision.

### 37.Searching for Ambiguous Objects in Videos using Relational Referring Expressions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01189.pdf)
>  Humans frequently use referring (identifying) expressions to refer to objects. Especially in ambiguous settings, humans prefer expressions (called relational referring expressions) that describe an object with respect to a distinguishing, unique object. Unlike studies on video object search using referring expressions, in this paper, our focus is on (i) relational referring expressions in highly ambiguous settings, and (ii) methods that can both generate and comprehend a referring expression. For this goal, we first introduce a new dataset for video object search with referring expressions that includes numerous copies of the objects, making it difficult to use non-relational expressions. Moreover, we train two baseline deep networks on this dataset, which show promising results. Finally, we propose a deep attention network that significantly outperforms the baselines on our dataset. The dataset and the codes are available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/hazananayurt/viref" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>. 
### 38.Learning Local Feature Descriptor with Motion Attribute for Vision-based Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01180.pdf)
>  In recent years, camera-based localization has been widely used for robotic applications, and most proposed algorithms rely on local features extracted from recorded images. For better performance, the features used for open-loop localization are required to be short-term globally static, and the ones used for re-localization or loop closure detection need to be long-term static. Therefore, the motion attribute of a local feature point could be exploited to improve localization performance, e.g., the feature points extracted from moving persons or vehicles can be excluded from these systems due to their unsteadiness. In this paper, we design a fully convolutional network (FCN), named MD-Net, to perform motion attribute estimation and feature description simultaneously. MD-Net has a shared backbone network to extract features from the input image and two network branches to complete each sub-task. With MD-Net, we can obtain the motion attribute while avoiding increasing much more computation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can learn distinct local feature descriptor along with motion attribute only using an FCN, by outperforming competing methods by a wide margin. We also show that the proposed algorithm can be integrated into a vision-based localization algorithm to improve estimation accuracy significantly. 
### 39.Permutation-invariant Feature Restructuring for Correlation-aware Image Set-based Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01174.pdf)
>  We consider the problem of comparing the similarity of image sets with variable-quantity, quality and un-ordered heterogeneous images. We use feature restructuring to exploit the correlations of both inner$\&amp;$inter-set images. Specifically, the residual self-attention can effectively restructure the features using the other features within a set to emphasize the discriminative images and eliminate the redundancy. Then, a sparse/collaborative learning-based dependency-guided representation scheme reconstructs the probe features conditional to the gallery features in order to adaptively align the two sets. This enables our framework to be compatible with both verification and open-set identification. We show that the parametric self-attention network and non-parametric dictionary learning can be trained end-to-end by a unified alternative optimization scheme, and that the full framework is permutation-invariant. In the numerical experiments we conducted, our method achieves top performance on competitive image set/video-based face recognition and person re-identification benchmarks. 
### 40.ABD-Net: Attentive but Diverse Person Re-Identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01114.pdf)
>  Attention mechanism has been shown to be effective for person re-identification (Re-ID). However, the learned attentive feature embeddings which are often not naturally diverse nor uncorrelated, will compromise the retrieval performance based on the Euclidean distance. We advocate that enforcing diversity could greatly complement the power of attention. To this end, we propose an Attentive but Diverse Network (ABD-Net), which seamlessly integrates attention modules and diversity regularization throughout the entire network, to learn features that are representative, robust, and more discriminative. Specifically, we introduce a pair of complementary attention modules, focusing on channel aggregation and position awareness, respectively. Furthermore, a new efficient form of orthogonality constraint is derived to enforce orthogonality on both hidden activations and weights. Through careful ablation studies, we verify that the proposed attentive and diverse terms each contributes to the performance gains of ABD-Net. On three popular benchmarks, ABD-Net consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. 
### 41.Simultaneous Semantic Segmentation and Outlier Detection in Presence of Domain Shift  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01098.pdf)
>  Recent success on realistic road driving datasets has increased interest in exploring robust performance in real-world applications. One of the major unsolved problems is to identify image content which can not be reliably recognized with a given inference engine. We therefore study approaches to recover a dense outlier map alongside the primary task with a single forward pass, by relying on shared convolutional features. We consider semantic segmentation as the primary task and perform extensive validation on WildDash val (inliers), LSUN val (outliers), and pasted objects from Pascal VOC 2007 (outliers). We achieve the best validation performance by training to discriminate inliers from pasted ImageNet-1k content, even though ImageNet-1k contains many road-driving pixels, and, at least nominally, fails to account for the full diversity of the visual world. The proposed two-head model performs comparably to the C-way multi-class model trained to predict uniform distribution in outliers, while outperforming several other validated approaches. We evaluate our best two models on the WildDash test dataset and set a new state of the art on the WildDash benchmark. 
### 42.Adaloss: Adaptive Loss Function for Landmark Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01070.pdf)
>  Landmark localization is a challenging problem in computer vision with a multitude of applications. Recent deep learning based methods have shown improved results by regressing likelihood maps instead of regressing the coordinates directly. However, setting the precision of these regression targets during the training is a cumbersome process since it creates a trade-off between trainability vs localization accuracy. Using precise targets introduces a significant sampling bias and hence makes the training more difficult, whereas using imprecise targets results in inaccurate landmark detectors. In this paper, we introduce "Adaloss", an objective function that adapts itself during the training by updating the target precision based on the training statistics. This approach does not require setting problem-specific parameters and shows improved stability in training and better localization accuracy during inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in three different applications of landmark localization: 1) the challenging task of precisely detecting catheter tips in medical X-ray images, 2) localizing surgical instruments in endoscopic images, and 3) localizing facial features on in-the-wild images where we show state-of-the-art results on the 300-W benchmark dataset. 
### 43.Cycle In Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks for Keypoint-Guided Image Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00999.pdf)
>  In this work, we propose a novel Cycle In Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (C$^2$GAN) for the task of keypoint-guided image generation. The proposed C$^2$GAN is a cross-modal framework exploring a joint exploitation of the keypoint and the image data in an interactive manner. C$^2$GAN contains two different types of generators, i.e., keypoint-oriented generator and image-oriented generator. Both of them are mutually connected in an end-to-end learnable fashion and explicitly form three cycled sub-networks, i.e., one image generation cycle and two keypoint generation cycles. Each cycle not only aims at reconstructing the input domain, and also produces useful output involving in the generation of another cycle. By so doing, the cycles constrain each other implicitly, which provides complementary information from the two different modalities and brings extra supervision across cycles, thus facilitating more robust optimization of the whole network. Extensive experimental results on two publicly available datasets, i.e., Radboud Faces and Market-1501, demonstrate that our approach is effective to generate more photo-realistic images compared with state-of-the-art models. 
### 44.A principled approach for generating adversarial images under non-smooth dissimilarity metrics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01667.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations: small changes in the input easily lead to misclassification. In this work, we propose an attack methodology catered not only for cases where the perturbations are measured by $\ell_p$ norms, but in fact any adversarial dissimilarity metric with a closed proximal form. This includes, but is not limited to, $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, $\ell_\infty$ perturbations, and the $\ell_0$ counting "norm", i.e. true sparseness. Our approach to generating perturbations is a natural extension of our recent work, the LogBarrier attack, which previously required the metric to be differentiable. We demonstrate our new algorithm, ProxLogBarrier, on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet-1k datasets. We attack undefended and defended models, and show that our algorithm transfers to various datasets with little parameter tuning. In particular, in the $\ell_0$ case, our algorithm finds significantly smaller perturbations compared to multiple existing methods 
### 45.Review of Algorithms for Compressive Sensing of Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01642.pdf)
>  We provide a comprehensive review of classical algorithms for compressive sensing of images, focused on Total variation methods, with a view to application in LiDAR systems. Our primary focus is providing a full review for beginners in the field, as well as simulating the kind of noise found in real LiDAR systems. To this end, we provide an overview of the theoretical background, a brief discussion of various considerations that come in to play in compressive sensing, and a standardized comparison of off-the-shelf methods, intended as a quick-start guide to choosing algorithms for compressive sensing applications. 
### 46.Knee menisci segmentation and relaxometry of 3D ultrashort echo time (UTE) cones MR imaging using attention U-Net with transfer learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01594.pdf)
>  The purpose of this work is to develop a deep learning-based method for knee menisci segmentation in 3D ultrashort echo time (UTE) cones magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and to automatically determine MR relaxation times, namely the T1, T1$\rho$, and T2* parameters, which can be used to assess knee osteoarthritis (OA). Whole knee joint imaging was performed using 3D UTE cones sequences to collect data from 61 human subjects. Regions of interest (ROIs) were outlined by two experienced radiologists based on subtracted T1$\rho$-weighted MR images. Transfer learning was applied to develop 2D attention U-Net convolutional neural networks for the menisci segmentation based on each radiologist's ROIs separately. Dice scores were calculated to assess segmentation performance. Next, the T1, T1$\rho$, T2* relaxations, and ROI areas were determined for the manual and automatic segmentations, then compared.The models developed using ROIs provided by two radiologists achieved high Dice scores of 0.860 and 0.833, while the radiologists' manual segmentations achieved a Dice score of 0.820. Linear correlation coefficients for the T1, T1$\rho$, and T2* relaxations calculated using the automatic and manual segmentations ranged between 0.90 and 0.97, and there were no associated differences between the estimated average meniscal relaxation parameters. The deep learning models achieved segmentation performance equivalent to the inter-observer variability of two radiologists. The proposed deep learning-based approach can be used to efficiently generate automatic segmentations and determine meniscal relaxations times. The method has the potential to help radiologists with the assessment of meniscal diseases, such as OA. 
### 47.High Accuracy Tumor Diagnoses and Benchmarking of Hematoxylin and Eosin Stained Prostate Core Biopsy Images Generated by Explainable Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01593.pdf)
>  Histopathological diagnoses of tumors in tissue biopsy after Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining is the gold standard for oncology care. H&amp;E staining is slow and uses dyes, reagents and precious tissue samples that cannot be reused. Thousands of native nonstained RGB Whole Slide Image (RWSI) patches of prostate core tissue biopsies were registered with their H&amp;E stained versions. Conditional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (cGANs) that automate conversion of native nonstained RWSI to computational H&amp;E stained images were then trained. High similarities between computational and H&amp;E dye stained images with Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.902, Pearsons Correlation Coefficient (CC) 0.962 and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) 22.821 dB were calculated. A second cGAN performed accurate computational destaining of H&amp;E dye stained images back to their native nonstained form with SSIM 0.9, CC 0.963 and PSNR 25.646 dB. A single-blind study computed more than 95% pixel-by-pixel overlap between prostate tumor annotations on computationally stained images, provided by five-board certified MD pathologists, with those on H&amp;E dye stained counterparts. We report the first visualization and explanation of neural network kernel activation maps during H&amp;E staining and destaining of RGB images by cGANs. High similarities between kernel activation maps of computational and H&amp;E stained images (Mean-Squared Errors &lt;0.0005) provide additional mathematical and mechanistic validation of the staining system. Our neural network framework thus is automated, explainable and performs high precision H&amp;E staining and destaining of low cost native RGB images, and is computer vision and physician authenticated for rapid and accurate tumor diagnoses. 
### 48.Knowledge Isomorphism between Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01581.pdf)
>  This paper aims to analyze knowledge isomorphism between pre-trained deep neural networks. We propose a generic definition for knowledge isomorphism between neural networks at different fuzziness levels, and design a task-agnostic and model-agnostic method to disentangle and quantify isomorphic features from intermediate layers of a neural network. As a generic tool, our method can be broadly used for different applications. In preliminary experiments, we have used knowledge isomorphism as a tool to diagnose feature representations of neural networks. Knowledge isomorphism provides new insights to explain the success of existing deep-learning techniques, such as knowledge distillation and network compression. More crucially, it has been shown that knowledge isomorphism can also be used to refine pre-trained networks and boost performance. 
### 49.Precise Estimation of Renal Vascular Dominant Regions Using Spatially Aware Fully Convolutional Networks, Tensor-Cut and Voronoi Diagrams  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01543.pdf)
>  This paper presents a new approach for precisely estimating the renal vascular dominant region using a Voronoi diagram. To provide computer-assisted diagnostics for the pre-surgical simulation of partial nephrectomy surgery, we must obtain information on the renal arteries and the renal vascular dominant regions. We propose a fully automatic segmentation method that combines a neural network and tensor-based graph-cut methods to precisely extract the kidney and renal arteries. First, we use a convolutional neural network to localize the kidney regions and extract tiny renal arteries with a tensor-based graph-cut method. Then we generate a Voronoi diagram to estimate the renal vascular dominant regions based on the segmented kidney and renal arteries. The accuracy of kidney segmentation in 27 cases with 8-fold cross validation reached a Dice score of 95%. The accuracy of renal artery segmentation in 8 cases obtained a centerline overlap ratio of 80%. Each partition region corresponds to a renal vascular dominant region. The final dominant-region estimation accuracy achieved a Dice coefficient of 80%. A clinical application showed the potential of our proposed estimation approach in a real clinical surgical environment. Further validation using large-scale database is our future work. 
### 50.Discriminating Spatial and Temporal Relevance in Deep Taylor Decompositions for Explainable Activity Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01536.pdf)
>  Current techniques for explainable AI have been applied with some success to image processing. The recent rise of research in video processing has called for similar work n deconstructing and explaining spatio-temporal models. While many techniques are designed for 2D convolutional models, others are inherently applicable to any input domain. One such body of work, deep Taylor decomposition, propagates relevance from the model output distributively onto its input and thus is not restricted to image processing models. However, by exploiting a simple technique that removes motion information, we show that it is not the case that this technique is effective as-is for representing relevance in non-image tasks. We instead propose a discriminative method that produces a naïve representation of both the spatial and temporal relevance of a frame as two separate objects. This new discriminative relevance model exposes relevance in the frame attributed to motion, that was previously ambiguous in the original explanation. We observe the effectiveness of this technique on a range of samples from the UCF-101 action recognition dataset, two of which are demonstrated in this paper. 
### 51.CameraNet: A Two-Stage Framework for Effective Camera ISP Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01481.pdf)
>  Traditional image signal processing (ISP) pipeline consists of a set of individual image processing components onboard a camera to reconstruct a high-quality sRGB image from the sensor raw data. Due to the hand-crafted nature of the ISP components, traditional ISP pipeline has limited reconstruction quality under challenging scenes. Recently, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their competitiveness in solving many individual image processing problems, such as image denoising, demosaicking, white balance and contrast enhancement. However, it remains a question whether a CNN model can address the multiple tasks inside an ISP pipeline simultaneously. We make a good attempt along this line and propose a novel framework, which we call CameraNet, for effective and general ISP pipeline learning. The CameraNet is composed of two CNN modules to account for two sets of relatively uncorrelated subtasks in an ISP pipeline: restoration and enhancement. To train the two-stage CameraNet model, we specify two groundtruths that can be easily created in the common workflow of photography. CameraNet is trained to progressively address the restoration and the enhancement subtasks with its two modules. Experiments show that the proposed CameraNet achieves consistently compelling reconstruction quality on three benchmark datasets and outperforms traditional ISP pipelines. 
### 52.Restricted Linearized Augmented Lagrangian Method for Euler's Elastica Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01429.pdf)
>  Euler's elastica model has been extensively studied and applied to image processing tasks. However, due to the high nonlinearity and nonconvexity of the involved curvature term, conventional algorithms suffer from slow convergence and high computational cost. Various fast algorithms have been proposed, among which, the augmented Lagrangian based ones are very popular in the community. However, parameter tuning might be very challenging for these methods. In this paper, a simple cutting-off strategy is introduced into the augmented Lagrangian based algorithms for minimizing the Euler's elastica energy, which leads to easy parameter tuning and fast convergence. The cutting-off strategy is based on an observation of inconsistency inside the augmented Lagrangian based algorithms. When the weighting parameter of the curvature term goes to zero, the energy functional boils down to the ROF model. So, a natural requirement is that its augmented Lagrangian based algorithms should also approach the augmented Lagrangian based algorithms formulated directly for solving the ROF model from the very beginning. Unfortunately, this is not the case for certain existing augmented Lagrangian based algorithms. The proposed cutting-off strategy helps to decouple the tricky dependence between the auxiliary splitting variables, so as to remove the observed inconsistency. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm enjoys easier parameter-tuning, faster convergence and even higher quality of image restorations. 
### 53.Simultaneous Clustering and Optimization for Evolving Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01384.pdf)
>  Simultaneous clustering and optimization (SCO) has recently drawn much attention due to its wide range of practical applications. Many methods have been previously proposed to solve this problem and obtain the optimal model. However, when a dataset evolves over time, those existing methods have to update the model frequently to guarantee accuracy; such updating is computationally infeasible. In this paper, we propose a new formulation of SCO to handle evolving datasets. Specifically, we propose a new variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve this problem efficiently. The guarantee of model accuracy is analyzed theoretically for two specific tasks: ridge regression and convex clustering. Extensive empirical studies confirm the effectiveness of our method. 
### 54.Unsupervised Microvascular Image Segmentation Using an Active Contours Mimicking Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01373.pdf)
>  The task of blood vessel segmentation in microscopy images is crucial for many diagnostic and research applications. However, vessels can look vastly different, depending on the transient imaging conditions, and collecting data for supervised training is laborious. We present a novel deep learning method for unsupervised segmentation of blood vessels. The method is inspired by the field of active contours and we introduce a new loss term, which is based on the morphological Active Contours Without Edges (ACWE) optimization method. The role of the morphological operators is played by novel pooling layers that are incorporated to the network's architecture.We demonstrate the challenges that are faced by previous supervised learning solutions, when the imaging conditions shift. Our unsupervised method is able to outperform such previous methods in both the labeled dataset, and when applied to similar but different datasets. Our code, as well as efficient PyTorch reimplementations of the baseline methods VesselNN and DeepVess is available on GitHub - <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/shirgur/UMIS" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.

>  IT support services industry is going through a major transformation with AI becoming commonplace. There has been a lot of effort in the direction of automation at every human touchpoint in the IT support processes. Incident management is one such process which has been a beacon process for AI based automation. The vision is to automate the process from the time an incident/ticket arrives till it is resolved and closed. While text is the primary mode of communicating the incidents, there has been a growing trend of using alternate modalities like image to communicate the problem. A large fraction of IT support tickets today contain attached image data in the form of screenshots, log messages, invoices and so on. These attachments help in better explanation of the problem which aids in faster resolution. Anybody who aspires to provide AI based IT support, it is essential to build systems which can handle multi-modal content. In this paper we present how incident management in IT support domain can be made much more effective using multi-modal analysis. The information extracted from different modalities are correlated to enrich the information in the ticket and used for better ticket routing and resolution. We evaluate our system using about 25000 real tickets containing attachments from selected problem areas. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in both routing and resolution with the use of multi-modal ticket analysis compared to only text based analysis. 
### 56.MoGA: Searching Beyond MobileNetV3  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01314.pdf)
>  The evolution of MobileNets has laid a solid foundation for neural network application on the mobile end. With the latest MobileNetV3, neural architecture search again claimed its supremacy on network design. Till today all mobile methods mainly focus on CPU latency instead of GPU, the latter, however, has lower overhead and interference and is much preferred in the industry. To mitigate this gap, we propose the first Mobile GPU-Aware (MoGA) neural architecture search in order to be precisely tailored for real-world applications. Further, the ultimate objective to devise a mobile network lies in achieving better performance by maximizing the utilization of bounded resources. While urging higher capability and restraining time consumption, we unconventionally encourage increasing the number of parameters for higher representational power. Undoubtedly, these three forces are not reconcilable and we have to alleviate the tension by weighted evolution techniques. Lastly, we deliver our searched networks at a mobile scale that outperform MobileNetV3 under the similar latency constraints, i.e., MoGA-A achieves 75.9\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, MoGA-B meets 75.5\% which costs only 0.5ms more on mobile GPU than MobileNetV3, which scores 75.2\%. MoGA-C best attests GPU-awareness by reaching 75.3\% and being slower on CPU but faster on GPU.

### 57.Building Deep, Equivariant Capsule Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01300.pdf)
>  Capsule networks are constrained by their, relative, inability to deeper in a parameter-inexpensive manner, and also by the general lack of equivariance guarantees. As a step towards bridging these two gaps, we present a new variation of capsule networks termed Space-of-Variation networks (SOVNET). Each layer in SOVNET learns to projectively represent the manifold of legal pose variations for a set of capsules, using learnable neural network - one per capsule-type. Thus, shallower capsules from a local pool predict a deeper capsule by being input into the neural network associated with the type of deeper capsule. In order to capture local object-structures better, benefit from increased parameter-sharing, and have equivariance guarantees; group-equivariant convolutions are used in the prediction mechanism. Further, a new routing algorithm based on the degree-centrality of graph nodes is presented. Experiments on affinely transformed versions of MNIST and FashionMNIST showcase the superiority of SOVNET over certain capsule-network baselines. 
### 58.BCD-Net for Low-dose CT Reconstruction: Acceleration, Convergence, and Generalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01287.pdf)
>  Obtaining accurate and reliable images from low-dose computed tomography (CT) is challenging. Regression convolutional neural network (CNN) models that are learned from training data are increasingly gaining attention in low-dose CT reconstruction. This paper modifies the architecture of an iterative regression CNN, BCD-Net, for fast, stable, and accurate low-dose CT reconstruction, and presents the convergence property of the modified BCD-Net. Numerical results with phantom data show that applying faster numerical solvers to model-based image reconstruction (MBIR) modules of BCD-Net leads to faster and more accurate BCD-Net; BCD-Net significantly improves the reconstruction accuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art MBIR method using learned transforms; BCD-Net achieves better image quality, compared to a state-of-the-art iterative NN architecture, ADMM-Net. Numerical results with clinical data show that BCD-Net generalizes significantly better than a state-of-the-art deep (non-iterative) regression NN, FBPConvNet, that lacks MBIR modules. 
### 59.Automatic segmentation of kidney and liver tumors in CT images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01279.pdf)
>  Automatic segmentation of hepatic lesions in computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task to perform due to heterogeneous, diffusive shape of tumors and complex background. To address the problem more and more researchers rely on assistance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with 2D or 3D type architecture that have proven to be effective in a wide range of computer vision tasks, including medical image processing. In this technical report, we carry out research focused on more careful approach to the process of learning rather than on complex architecture of the CNN. We have chosen MICCAI 2017 LiTS dataset for training process and the public 3DIRCADb dataset for validation of our method. The proposed algorithm reached DICE score 78.8% on the 3DIRCADb dataset. The described method was then applied to the 2019 Kidney Tumor Segmentation (KiTS-2019) challenge, where our single submission achieved 96.38% for kidney and 67.38% for tumor Dice scores. 
### 60.CRNet: Image Super-Resolution Using A Convolutional Sparse Coding Inspired Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01166.pdf)
>  Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) has been attracting more and more attention in recent years, for making full use of image global correlation to improve performance on various computer vision applications. However, very few studies focus on solving CSC based image Super-Resolution (SR) problem. As a consequence, there is no significant progress in this area over a period of time. In this paper, we exploit the natural connection between CSC and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to address CSC based image SR. Specifically, Convolutional Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm (CISTA) is introduced to solve CSC problem and it can be implemented using CNN architectures. Then we develop a novel CSC based SR framework analogy to the traditional SC based SR methods. Two models inspired by this framework are proposed for pre-/post-upsampling SR, respectively. Compared with recent state-of-the-art SR methods, both of our proposed models show superior performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative measurements. 
### 61.ADN: Artifact Disentanglement Network for Unsupervised Metal Artifact Reduction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01104.pdf)
>  Current deep neural network based approaches to computed tomography (CT) metal artifact reduction (MAR) are supervised methods that rely on synthesized metal artifacts for training. However, as synthesized data may not accurately simulate the underlying physical mechanisms of CT imaging, the supervised methods often generalize poorly to clinical applications. To address this problem, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first unsupervised learning approach to MAR. Specifically, we introduce a novel artifact disentanglement network that disentangles the metal artifacts from CT images in the latent space. It supports different forms of generations (artifact reduction, artifact transfer, and self-reconstruction, etc.) with specialized loss functions to obviate the need for supervision with synthesized data. Extensive experiments show that when applied to a synthesized dataset, our method addresses metal artifacts significantly better than the existing unsupervised models designed for natural image-to-image translation problems, and achieves comparable performance to existing supervised models for MAR. When applied to clinical datasets, our method demonstrates better generalization ability over the supervised models.

### 62.Toward Understanding Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01091.pdf)
>  We study the relationship between catastrophic forgetting and properties of task sequences. In particular, given a sequence of tasks, we would like to understand which properties of this sequence influence the error rates of continual learning algorithms trained on the sequence. To this end, we propose a new procedure that makes use of recent developments in task space modeling as well as correlation analysis to specify and analyze the properties we are interested in. As an application, we apply our procedure to study two properties of a task sequence: (1) total complexity and (2) sequential heterogeneity. We show that error rates are strongly and positively correlated to a task sequence's total complexity for some state-of-the-art algorithms. We also show that, surprisingly, the error rates have no or even negative correlations in some cases to sequential heterogeneity. Our findings suggest directions for improving continual learning benchmarks and methods. 
### 63.Y-Net: A Hybrid Deep Learning Reconstruction Framework for Photoacoustic Imaging in vivo  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00975.pdf)
>  Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging non-invasive imaging modality combining the advantages of deep ultrasound penetration and high optical contrast. Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.
