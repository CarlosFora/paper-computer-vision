### 1.Recognition of Russian traffic signs in winter conditions. Solutions of the "Ice Vision" competition winners  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07311.pdf)
>  With the advancements of various autonomous car projects aiming to achieve SAE Level 5, real-time detection of traffic signs in real-life scenarios has become a highly relevant problem for the industry. Even though a great progress has been achieved in this field, there is still no clear consensus on what the state-of-the-art in this field is. <br>Moreover, it is important to develop and test systems in various regions and conditions. This is why the "Ice Vision" competition has focused on the detection of Russian traffic signs in winter conditions. The IceVisionSet dataset used for this competition features real-world collection of lossless frame sequences with traffic sign annotations. The sequences were collected in varying conditions, including: different weather, camera exposure, illumination and moving speeds. <br>In this work we describe the competition and present the solutions of the 3 top teams. 
### 2.More About Covariance Descriptors for Image Set Coding: Log-Euclidean Framework based Kernel Matrix Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07273.pdf)
>  We consider a family of structural descriptors for visual data, namely covariance descriptors (CovDs) that lie on a non-linear symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold, a special type of Riemannian manifolds. We propose an improved version of CovDs for image set coding by extending the traditional CovDs from Euclidean space to the SPD manifold. Specifically, the manifold of SPD matrices is a complete inner product space with the operations of logarithmic multiplication and scalar logarithmic multiplication defined in the Log-Euclidean framework. In this framework, we characterise covariance structure in terms of the arc-cosine kernel which satisfies Mercer's condition and propose the operation of mean centralization on SPD matrices. Furthermore, we combine arc-cosine kernels of different orders using mixing parameters learnt by kernel alignment in a supervised manner. Our proposed framework provides a lower-dimensional and more discriminative data representation for the task of image set classification. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance, measured in terms of recognition accuracy, as compared with the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 3.Place Recognition for Stereo VisualOdometry using LiDAR descriptors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07267.pdf)
>  Place recognition is a core component in SLAM, and in most visual SLAM systems, it is based on the similarity between 2D images. However, the 3D points generated by visual odometry, and the structure information embedded within, are not exploited. In this paper, we adapt place recognition methods for 3D point clouds into stereo visual odometry. Stereo visual odometry generates 3D point clouds with a consistent scale. Thus, we are able to use global LiDAR descriptors for 3D point clouds to determine the similarity between places. 3D point clouds are more reliable than 2D visual cues (e.g., 2D features) against environmental changes such as varying illumination and can benefit visual SLAM systems in long-term deployment scenarios. Extensive evaluation on a public dataset (Oxford RobotCar) demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of using 3D point clouds for place recognition over 2D methods.

### 5.DeepTIO: A Deep Thermal-Inertial Odometry with Visual Hallucination  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07231.pdf)
>  Visual odometry shows excellent performance in a wide range of environments. However, in visually-denied scenarios (e.g. heavy smoke or darkness), pose estimates degrade or even fail. Thermal imaging cameras are commonly used for perception and inspection when the environment has low visibility. However, their use in odometry estimation is hampered by the lack of robust visual features. In part, this is as a result of the sensor measuring the ambient temperature profile rather than scene appearance and geometry. To overcome these issues, we propose a Deep Neural Network model for thermal-inertial odometry (DeepTIO) by incorporating a visual hallucination network to provide the thermal network with complementary information. The hallucination network is taught to predict fake visual features from thermal images by using the robust Huber loss. We also employ selective fusion to attentively fuse the features from three different modalities, i.e thermal, hallucination, and inertial features. Extensive experiments are performed in our large scale hand-held data in benign and smoke-filled environments, showing the efficacy of the proposed model. 
### 6.Global Aggregation then Local Distribution in Fully Convolutional Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07229.pdf)
>  It has been widely proven that modelling long-range dependencies in fully convolutional networks (FCNs) via global aggregation modules is critical for complex scene understanding tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. However, global aggregation is often dominated by features of large patterns and tends to oversmooth regions that contain small patterns (e.g., boundaries and small objects). To resolve this problem, we propose to first use \emph{Global Aggregation} and then \emph{Local Distribution}, which is called GALD, where long-range dependencies are more confidently used inside large pattern regions and vice versa. The size of each pattern at each position is estimated in the network as a per-channel mask map. GALD is end-to-end trainable and can be easily plugged into existing FCNs with various global aggregation modules for a wide range of vision tasks, and consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art object detection and instance segmentation approaches. In particular, GALD used in semantic segmentation achieves new state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes test set with mIoU 83.3\%.

### 7.ICDAR2019 Robust Reading Challenge on Arbitrary-Shaped Text (RRC-ArT)  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07145.pdf)

### 8.PLIN: A Network for Pseudo-LiDAR Point Cloud Interpolation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07137.pdf)
>  LiDAR sensors can provide dependable 3D spatial information at a low frequency (around 10Hz) and have been widely applied in the field of autonomous driving and UAV. However, the camera with a higher frequency (around 20Hz) has to be decreased so as to match with LiDAR in a multi-sensor system. In this paper, we propose a novel Pseudo-LiDAR interpolation network (PLIN) to increase the frequency of LiDAR sensors. PLIN can generate temporally and spatially high-quality point cloud sequences to match the high frequency of cameras. To achieve this goal, we design a coarse interpolation stage guided by consecutive sparse depth maps and motion relationship. We also propose a refined interpolation stage guided by the realistic scene. Using this coarse-to-fine cascade structure, our method can progressively perceive multi-modal information and generate accurate intermediate point clouds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep framework for Pseudo-LiDAR point cloud interpolation, which shows appealing applications in navigation systems equipped with LiDAR and cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that PLIN achieves promising performance on the KITTI dataset, significantly outperforming the traditional interpolation method and the state-of-the-art video interpolation technique. 
### 9.TextSR: Content-Aware Text Super-Resolution Guided by Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07113.pdf)
>  Scene text recognition has witnessed rapid development with the advance of convolutional neural networks. Nonetheless, most of the previous methods may not work well in recognizing text with low resolution which is often seen in natural scene images. An intuitive solution is to introduce super-resolution techniques as pre-processing. However, conventional super-resolution methods in the literature mainly focus on reconstructing the detailed texture of natural images, which typically do not work well for text due to the unique characteristics of text. To tackle these problems, in this work, we propose a content-aware text super-resolution network to generate the information desired for text recognition. In particular, we design an end-to-end network that can perform super-resolution and text recognition simultaneously. Different from previous super-resolution methods, we use the loss of text recognition as the Text Perceptual Loss to guide the training of the super-resolution network, and thus it pays more attention to the text content, rather than the irrelevant background area. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in restoring a sharp high-resolution image from a small blurred one, and show that the recognition performance clearly boosts up the performance of text recognizer. To our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on text super-resolution. Code will be released in <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/xieenze/TextSR" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>. 
### 10.CELNet: Evidence Localization for Pathology Images using Weakly Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07097.pdf)
>  Despite deep convolutional neural networks boost the performance of image classification and segmentation in digital pathology analysis, they are usually weak in interpretability for clinical applications or require heavy annotations to achieve object localization. To overcome this problem, we propose a weakly supervised learning-based approach that can effectively learn to localize the discriminative evidence for a diagnostic label from weakly labeled training data. Experimental results show that our proposed method can reliably pinpoint the location of cancerous evidence supporting the decision of interest, while still achieving a competitive performance on glimpse-level and slide-level histopathologic cancer detection tasks. 
### 11.Controllable Text-to-Image Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07083.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a novel controllable text-to-image generative adversarial network (ControlGAN), which can effectively synthesise high-quality images and also control parts of the image generation according to natural language descriptions. To achieve this, we introduce a word-level spatial and channel-wise attention-driven generator that can disentangle different visual attributes, and allow the model to focus on generating and manipulating subregions corresponding to the most relevant words. Also, a word-level discriminator is proposed to provide fine-grained supervisory feedback by correlating words with image regions, facilitating training an effective generator which is able to manipulate specific visual attributes without affecting the generation of other contents. Furthermore, perceptual loss is adopted to reduce the randomness involved in the image generation, and to encourage the generator to manipulate specific attributes required in the modified text. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state of the art, and is able to effectively manipulate synthetic images using natural language descriptions. 
### 12.Classification-Specific Parts for Improving Fine-Grained Visual Categorization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07075.pdf)
>  Fine-grained visual categorization is a classification task for distinguishing categories with high intra-class and small inter-class variance. While global approaches aim at using the whole image for performing the classification, part-based solutions gather additional local information in terms of attentions or parts. We propose a novel classification-specific part estimation that uses an initial prediction as well as back-propagation of feature importance via gradient computations in order to estimate relevant image regions. The subsequently detected parts are then not only selected by a-posteriori classification knowledge, but also have an intrinsic spatial extent that is determined automatically. This is in contrast to most part-based approaches and even to available ground-truth part annotations, which only provide point coordinates and no additional scale information. We show in our experiments on various widely-used fine-grained datasets the effectiveness of the mentioned part selection method in conjunction with the extracted part features. 
### 13.Temporally Consistent Depth Prediction with Flow-Guided Memory Units  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07074.pdf)
>  Predicting depth from a monocular video sequence is an important task for autonomous driving. Although it has advanced considerably in the past few years, recent methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) discard temporal coherence in the video sequence and estimate depth independently for each frame, which often leads to undesired inconsistent results over time. To address this problem, we propose to memorize temporal consistency in the video sequence, and leverage it for the task of depth prediction. To this end, we introduce a two-stream CNN with a flow-guided memory module, where each stream encodes visual and temporal features, respectively. The memory module, implemented using convolutional gated recurrent units (ConvGRUs), inputs visual and temporal features sequentially together with optical flow tailored to our task. It memorizes trajectories of individual features selectively and propagates spatial information over time, enforcing a long-term temporal consistency to prediction results. We evaluate our method on the KITTI benchmark dataset in terms of depth prediction accuracy, temporal consistency and runtime, and achieve a new state of the art. We also provide an extensive experimental analysis, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach to memorizing temporal consistency for depth prediction. 
### 14.A Real-Time Cross-modality Correlation Filtering Method for Referring Expression Comprehension  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07072.pdf)
>  Referring expression comprehension aims to localize the object instance described by a natural language expression. Current referring expression methods have achieved pretty-well performance. However, none of them is able to achieve real-time inference without accuracy drop. The reason for the relatively slow inference speed is that these methods artificially split the referring expression comprehension into two sequential stages including proposal generation and proposal ranking. It does not exactly conform to the habit of human cognition. To this end, we propose a novel Real-time Cross-modality Correlation Filtering method (RCCF). RCCF reformulates the referring expression as a correlation filtering process. The expression is first mapped from the language domain to the visual domain and then treated as a template (kernel) to perform correlation filtering on the image feature map. The peak value in the correlation heatmap indicates the center points of the target box. In addition, RCCF also regresses a 2-D object size and 2-D offset. The center point coordinates, object size and center point offset together form the target bounding-box. Our method runs at 40 FPS while achieves leading performance in RefClef, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg benchmarks. In the challenge RefClef dataset, our methods almost double the state-of-the-art performance(34.70% increased to 63.79%). We hope this work can arouse more attention and studies to the new cross-modality correlation filtering framework as well as the one-stage framework for referring expression comprehension. 
### 15.Pose Neural Fabrics Search  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07068.pdf)
>  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technologies have been successfully performed for efficient neural architectures for tasks such as image classification and semantic segmentation. However, existing works implement NAS for target tasks independently of domain knowledge and focus only on searching for an architecture to replace the human-designed network in a common pipeline. Can we exploit human prior knowledge to guide NAS? To address it, we propose a framework, named Pose Neural Fabrics Search (PNFS), introducing prior knowledge of body structure into NAS for human pose estimation. We lead a new neural architecture search space, by parameterizing cell-based neural fabric, to learn micro as well as macro neural architecture using a differentiable search strategy. To take advantage of part-based structural knowledge of the human body and learning capability of NAS, global pose constraint relationships are modeled as multiple part representations, each of which is predicted by a personalized neural fabric. In part representation, we view human skeleton keypoints as entities by representing them as vectors at image locations, expecting it to capture keypoint's feature in a relaxed vector space. The experiments on MPII and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that PNFS can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, with fewer parameters and lower computational complexity. 
### 16.Motion Guided Attention for Video Salient Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07061.pdf)
>  Video salient object detection aims at discovering the most visually distinctive objects in a video. How to effectively take object motion into consideration during video salient object detection is a critical issue. Existing state-of-the-art methods either do not explicitly model and harvest motion cues or ignore spatial contexts within optical flow images. In this paper, we develop a multi-task motion guided video salient object detection network, which learns to accomplish two sub-tasks using two sub-networks, one sub-network for salient object detection in still images and the other for motion saliency detection in optical flow images. We further introduce a series of novel motion guided attention modules, which utilize the motion saliency sub-network to attend and enhance the sub-network for still images. These two sub-networks learn to adapt to each other by end-to-end training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide range of benchmarks. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in video salient object detection. Code and models will be made available. 
### 17.Learning Spatial Awareness to Improve Crowd Counting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07057.pdf)
>  The aim of crowd counting is to estimate the number of people in images by leveraging the annotation of center positions for pedestrians' heads. Promising progresses have been made with the prevalence of deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Existing methods widely employ the Euclidean distance (i.e., $L_2$ loss) to optimize the model, which, however, has two main drawbacks: (1) the loss has difficulty in learning the spatial awareness (i.e., the position of head) since it struggles to retain the high-frequency variation in the density map, and (2) the loss is highly sensitive to various noises in crowd counting, such as the zero-mean noise, head size changes, and occlusions. Although the Maximum Excess over SubArrays (MESA) loss has been previously proposed to address the above issues by finding the rectangular subregion whose predicted density map has the maximum difference from the ground truth, it cannot be solved by gradient descent, thus can hardly be integrated into the deep learning framework. In this paper, we present a novel architecture called SPatial Awareness Network (SPANet) to incorporate spatial context for crowd counting. The Maximum Excess over Pixels (MEP) loss is proposed to achieve this by finding the pixel-level subregion with high discrepancy to the ground truth. To this end, we devise a weakly supervised learning scheme to generate such region with a multi-branch architecture. The proposed framework can be integrated into existing deep crowd counting methods and is end-to-end trainable. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks show that our method can significantly improve the performance of baselines. More remarkably, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all benchmark datasets. 
### 18.A Single Multi-Task Deep Neural Network with Post-Processing for Object Detection with Reasoning and Robotic Grasp Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07050.pdf)
>  Recently, robotic grasp detection (GD) and object detection (OD) with reasoning have been investigated using deep neural networks (DNNs). There have been works to combine these multi-tasks using separate networks so that robots can deal with situations of grasping specific target objects in the cluttered, stacked, complex piles of novel objects from a single RGB-D camera. We propose a single multi-task DNN that yields the information on GD, OD and relationship reasoning among objects with a simple post-processing. Our proposed methods yielded state-of-the-art performance with the accuracy of 98.6% and 74.2% and the computation speed of 33 and 62 frame per second on VMRD and Cornell datasets, respectively. Our methods also yielded 95.3% grasp success rate for single novel object grasping with a 4-axis robot arm and 86.7% grasp success rate in cluttered novel objects with a Baxter robot. 
### 19.$360^o$ Surface Regression with a Hyper-Sphere Loss  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07043.pdf)
>  Omnidirectional vision is becoming increasingly relevant as more efficient $360^o$ image acquisition is now possible. However, the lack of annotated $360^o$ datasets has hindered the application of deep learning techniques on spherical content. This is further exaggerated on tasks where ground truth acquisition is difficult, such as monocular surface estimation. While recent research approaches on the 2D domain overcome this challenge by relying on generating normals from depth cues using RGB-D sensors, this is very difficult to apply on the spherical domain. In this work, we address the unavailability of sufficient $360^o$ ground truth normal data, by leveraging existing 3D datasets and remodelling them via rendering. We present a dataset of $360^o$ images of indoor spaces with their corresponding ground truth surface normal, and train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on the task of monocular 360 surface estimation. We achieve this by minimizing a novel angular loss function defined on the hyper-sphere using simple quaternion algebra. We put an effort to appropriately compare with other state of the art methods trained on planar datasets and finally, present the practical applicability of our trained model on a spherical image re-lighting task using completely unseen data by qualitatively showing the promising generalization ability of our dataset and model. The dataset is available at: <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://vcl3d.github.io/HyperSphereSurfaceRegression" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a>. 
### 20.Boosting Real-Time Driving Scene Parsing with Shared Semantics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07038.pdf)
>  Real-time scene parsing is a fundamental feature for autonomous driving vehicles with multiple cameras. Comparing with traditional methods which individually process the frames from each camera, in this letter we demonstrate that sharing semantics between cameras with overlapped views can boost the parsing performance. Our framework is based on a deep neural network for semantic segmentation but with two kinds of additional modules for sharing and fusing semantics. On one hand, a semantics sharing module is designed to establish the pixel-wise mapping between the input image pair. Features as well as semantics are shared by the map to reduce duplicated workload which leads to more efficient computation. On the other hand, feature fusion modules are designed to combine different modal of semantic features, which learns to leverage the information from both inputs for better results. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we collect a new dataset with a dual-camera vision system for driving scene parsing. Experimental results show that our network outperforms the baseline method on the parsing accuracy with comparable computations. 
### 21.Multi-person Pose Tracking using Sequential Monte Carlo with Probabilistic Neural Pose Predictor  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07031.pdf)
>  It is an effective strategy for the multi-person pose tracking task in videos to employ prediction and pose matching in a frame-by-frame manner. For this type of approach, uncertainty-aware modeling is essential because precise prediction is impossible. However, previous studies have relied on only a single prediction without incorporating uncertainty, which can cause critical tracking errors if the prediction is unreliable. This paper proposes an extension to this approach with Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). This naturally reformulates the tracking scheme to handle multiple predictions (or hypotheses) of poses, thereby mitigating the negative effect of prediction errors. An important component of SMC, i.e., a proposal distribution, is designed as a probabilistic neural pose predictor, which can propose diverse and plausible hypotheses by incorporating epistemic uncertainty and heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty. In addition, a recurrent architecture is introduced to our neural modeling to utilize time-sequence information of poses to manage difficult situations, such as the frequent disappearance and reappearances of poses. Compared to existing baselines, the proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art MOTA score on the PoseTrack2018 validation dataset by reducing approximately 50% of tracking errors from a state-of-the art baseline method. 
### 22.Learning Residual Flow as Dynamic Motion from Stereo Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06999.pdf)
>  We present a method for decomposing the 3D scene flow observed from a moving stereo rig into stationary scene elements and dynamic object motion. Our unsupervised learning framework jointly reasons about the camera motion, optical flow, and 3D motion of moving objects. Three cooperating networks predict stereo matching, camera motion, and residual flow, which represents the flow component due to object motion and not from camera motion. Based on rigid projective geometry, the estimated stereo depth is used to guide the camera motion estimation, and the depth and camera motion are used to guide the residual flow estimation. We also explicitly estimate the 3D scene flow of dynamic objects based on the residual flow and scene depth. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms on the optical flow and visual odometry tasks. 
### 23.Learning Controls Using Cross-Modal Representations: Bridging Simulation and Reality for Drone Racing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06993.pdf)
>  Machines are a long way from robustly solving open-world perception-control tasks, such as first-person view (FPV) drone racing. While recent advances in Machine Learning, especially Reinforcement and Imitation Learning show promise, they are constrained by the need of large amounts of difficult to collect real-world data for learning robust behaviors in diverse scenarios. In this work we propose to learn rich representations and policies by leveraging unsupervised data, such as video footage from an FPV drone, together with easy to generate simulated labeled data. Our approach takes a cross-modal perspective, where separate modalities correspond to the raw camera sensor data and the system states relevant to the task, such as the relative pose gates to the UAV. We fuse both data modalities into a novel factored architecture that learns a joint low-dimensional representation via Variational Auto Encoders. Such joint representations allow us to leverage rich labeled information from simulations together with the diversity of possible experiences via the unsupervised real-world data. We present experiments in simulation that provide insights into the rich latent spaces learned with our proposed representations, and also show that the use of our cross-modal architecture improves control policy performance in over 5X in comparison with end-to-end learning or purely unsupervised feature extractors. Finally, we present real-life results for drone navigation, showing that the learned representations and policies can generalize across simulation and reality. 
### 24.Unsupervised Eyeglasses Removal in the Wild  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06989.pdf)
>  Eyeglasses removal is challenging in removing different kinds of eyeglasses, e.g., rimless glasses, full-rim glasses and sunglasses, and recovering appropriate eyes. Due to the large visual variants, the conventional methods lack scalability. Most existing works focus on the frontal face images in the controlled environment such as laboratory and need to design specific systems for different eyeglass types. To address the limitation, we propose a unified eyeglass removal model called Eyeglasses Removal Generative Adversarial Network (ERGAN), which could handle different types of glasses in the wild. The proposed method does not depend on the dense annotation of eyeglasses location but benefits from the large-scale face images with weak annotations. Specifically, we study the two relevant tasks simultaneously, i.e., removing and wearing eyeglasses. Given two facial images with and without eyeglasses, the proposed model learns to swap the eye area in two faces. The generation mechanism focuses on the eye area and invades the difficulty of generating a new face. In the experiment, we show the proposed method achieves a competitive removal quality in terms of realism and diversity. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on several subsequent tasks, such as face verification and facial expression recognition. The experiment shows that our method could serve as a pre-processing method for these tasks. 
### 25.Visuomotor Understanding for Representation Learning of Driving Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06979.pdf)
>  Dashboard cameras capture a tremendous amount of driving scene video each day. These videos are purposefully coupled with vehicle sensing data, such as from the speedometer and inertial sensors, providing an additional sensing modality for free. In this work, we leverage the large-scale unlabeled yet naturally paired data for visual representation learning in the driving scenario. A representation is learned in an end-to-end self-supervised framework for predicting dense optical flow from a single frame with paired sensing data. We postulate that success on this task requires the network to learn semantic and geometric knowledge in the ego-centric view. For example, forecasting a future view to be seen from a moving vehicle requires an understanding of scene depth, scale, and movement of objects. We demonstrate that our learned representation can benefit other tasks that require detailed scene understanding and outperforms competing unsupervised representations on semantic segmentation. 
### 26.Interpreting and Improving Adversarial Robustness with Neuron Sensitivity  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06978.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples where inputs with imperceptible perturbations mislead DNNs to incorrect results. Despite the potential risk they bring, adversarial examples are also valuable for providing insights into the weakness and blind-spots of DNNs. Thus, the interpretability of a DNN in adversarial setting aims to explain the rationale behind its decision-making process and makes deeper understanding which results in better practical applications. To address this issue, we try to explain adversarial robustness for deep models from a new perspective of neuron sensitivity which is measured by neuron behavior variation intensity against benign and adversarial examples. In this paper, we first draw the close connection between adversarial robustness and neuron sensitivities, as sensitive neurons make the most non-trivial contributions to model predictions in adversarial setting. Based on that, we further propose to improve adversarial robustness by constraining the similarities of sensitive neurons between benign and adversarial examples which stabilizes the behaviors of sensitive neurons in adversarial setting. Moreover, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art adversarial training methods improve model robustness by reducing neuron sensitivities which in turn confirms the strong connections between adversarial robustness and neuron sensitivity as well as the effectiveness of using sensitive neurons to build robust models. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our algorithm effectively achieve excellent results. 
### 27.Perspective-Guided Convolution Networks for Crowd Counting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06966.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a novel perspective-guided convolution (PGC) for convolutional neural network (CNN) based crowd counting (i.e. PGCNet), which aims to overcome the dramatic intra-scene scale variations of people due to the perspective effect. While most state-of-the-arts adopt multi-scale or multi-column architectures to address such issue, they generally fail in modeling continuous scale variations since only discrete representative scales are considered. PGCNet, on the other hand, utilizes perspective information to guide the spatially variant smoothing of feature maps before feeding them to the successive convolutions. An effective perspective estimation branch is also introduced to PGCNet, which can be trained in either supervised setting or weakly-supervised setting when the branch has been pre-trained. Our PGCNet is single-column with moderate increase in computation, and extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets show the improvements of our method against the state-of-the-arts. Additionally, we also introduce Crowd Surveillance, a large scale dataset for crowd counting that contains 13,000+ high-resolution images with challenging scenarios. 
### 28.Multimodal Deep Models for Predicting Affective Responses Evoked by Movies  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06957.pdf)
>  The goal of this study is to develop and analyze multimodal models for predicting experienced affective responses of viewers watching movie clips. We develop hybrid multimodal prediction models based on both the video and audio of the clips. For the video content, we hypothesize that both image content and motion are crucial features for evoked emotion prediction. To capture such information, we extract features from RGB frames and optical flow using pre-trained neural networks. For the audio model, we compute an enhanced set of low-level descriptors including intensity, loudness, cepstrum, linear predictor coefficients, pitch and voice quality. Both visual and audio features are then concatenated to create audio-visual features, which are used to predict the evoked emotion. To classify the movie clips into the corresponding affective response categories, we propose two approaches based on deep neural network models. The first one is based on fully connected layers without memory on the time component, the second incorporates the sequential dependency with a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM). We perform a thorough analysis of the importance of each feature set. Our experiments reveal that in our set-up, predicting emotions at each time step independently gives slightly better accuracy performance than with the LSTM. Interestingly, we also observe that the optical flow is more informative than the RGB in videos, and overall, models using audio features are more accurate than those based on video features when making the final prediction of evoked emotions. 
### 29.PSGAN: Pose-Robust Spatial-Aware GAN for Customizable Makeup Transfer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06956.pdf)
>  We propose a novel Pose-robust Spatial-aware GAN (PSGAN) for transferring the makeup style from a reference image to a source image. Previous GAN-based methods often fail in cases with variant poses and expressions. Also, they cannot adjust the shade of makeup or specify the part of transfer. To address these issues, the proposed PSGAN includes a Makeup Distillation Network to distill the makeup style of the reference image into two spatial-aware makeup matrices. Then an Attentive Makeup Morphing module is introduced to specify how a pixel in the source image is morphed from the reference image. The pixelwise correspondence is built upon both the relative position features and visual features. Based on the morphed makeup matrices, a De-makeup Re-makeup Network performs makeup transfer. By incorporating the above novelties, our PSGAN not only achieves state-of-the-art results on the existing datasets, but also is able to perform the customizable part-by-part, shade controllable and pose-robust makeup transfer. 
### 30.Learning to Map Nearly Anything  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06928.pdf)
>  Looking at the world from above, it is possible to estimate many properties of a given location, including the type of land cover and the expected land use. Historically, such tasks have relied on relatively coarse-grained categories due to the difficulty of obtaining fine-grained annotations. In this work, we propose an easily extensible approach that makes it possible to estimate fine-grained properties from overhead imagery. In particular, we propose a cross-modal distillation strategy to learn to predict the distribution of fine-grained properties from overhead imagery, without requiring any manual annotation of overhead imagery. We show that our learned models can be used directly for applications in mapping and image localization. 
### 31.Using an AI creativity system to explore how aesthetic experiences are processed along the brains perceptual neural pathways  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06904.pdf)
>  With the increased sophistication of AI techniques, the application of these systems has been expanding to ever newer fields. Increasingly, these systems are being used in modeling of human aesthetics and creativity, e.g. how humans create artworks and design products. Our lab has developed one such AI creativity deep learning system that can be used to create artworks in the form of images and videos. In this paper, we describe this system and its use in studying the human visual system and the formation of aesthetic experiences. Specifically, we show how time-based AI created media can be used to explore the nature of the dual-pathway neuro-architecture of the human visual system and how this relates to higher cognitive judgments such as aesthetic experiences that rely on these divergent information streams. We propose a theoretical framework for how the movement within percepts such as video clips, causes the engagement of reflexive attention and a subsequent focus on visual information that are primarily processed via the dorsal stream, thereby modulating aesthetic experiences that rely on information relayed via the ventral stream. We outline our recent study in support of our proposed framework, which serves as the first study that investigates the relationship between the two visual streams and aesthetic experiences. 
### 32.Non-Causal Tracking by Deblatting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06894.pdf)
>  Tracking by Deblatting stands for solving an inverse problem of deblurring and image matting for tracking motion-blurred objects. We propose non-causal Tracking by Deblatting which estimates continuous, complete and accurate object trajectories. Energy minimization by dynamic programming is used to detect abrupt changes of motion, called bounces. High-order polynomials are fitted to segments, which are parts of the trajectory separated by bounces. The output is a continuous trajectory function which assigns location for every real-valued time stamp from zero to the number of frames. Additionally, we show that from the trajectory function precise physical calculations are possible, such as radius, gravity or sub-frame object velocity. Velocity estimation is compared to the high-speed camera measurements and radars. Results show high performance of the proposed method in terms of Trajectory-IoU, recall and velocity estimation. 
### 33.Learning an Effective Equivariant 3D Descriptor Without Supervision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06887.pdf)
>  Establishing correspondences between 3D shapes is a fundamental task in 3D Computer Vision, typically addressed by matching local descriptors. Recently, a few attempts at applying the deep learning paradigm to the task have shown promising results. Yet, the only explored way to learn rotation invariant descriptors has been to feed neural networks with highly engineered and invariant representations provided by existing hand-crafted descriptors, a path that goes in the opposite direction of end-to-end learning from raw data so successfully deployed for 2D images. In this paper, we explore the benefits of taking a step back in the direction of end-to-end learning of 3D descriptors by disentangling the creation of a robust and distinctive rotation equivariant representation, which can be learned from unoriented input data, and the definition of a good canonical orientation, required only at test time to obtain an invariant descriptor. To this end, we leverage two recent innovations: spherical convolutional neural networks to learn an equivariant descriptor and plane folding decoders to learn without supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is experimentally validated by outperforming hand-crafted and learned descriptors on a standard benchmark. 
### 34.Performance Evaluation of Learned 3D Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06884.pdf)
>  Matching surfaces is a challenging 3D Computer Vision problem typically addressed by local features. Although a variety of 3D feature detectors and descriptors has been proposed in literature, they have seldom been proposed together and it is yet not clear how to identify the most effective detector-descriptor pair for a specific application. A promising solution is to leverage machine learning to learn the optimal 3D detector for any given 3D descriptor [15]. In this paper, we report a performance evaluation of the detector-descriptor pairs obtained by learning a paired 3D detector for the most popular 3D descriptors. In particular, we address experimental settings dealing with object recognition and surface registration. 
### 35.A Dual-hierarchy Semantic Graph for Robust Object Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06867.pdf)
>  We present a system for object recognition based on a semantic model graph, which it can learn automatically from image examples. This model graph is based on intrinsic properties of objects such as structure and geometry, so it is more robust than the current machine learning methods that can be fooled by changing a few pixels. Current methods have proved to be powerful but fragile because they ignore the structure and semantics of the objects. We define semantics, or abstraction, in terms of the intrinsic properties of the object, not in terms of human language, so it can be learned automatically. Our model graph is more versatile than previous ones because it uses two distinct hierarchies: parts and abstraction. Previous semantic networks used only one amorphous hierarchy and were hard to build and traverse. Our system performs both the learning and recognition by an algorithm that moves in both hierarchies at the some time, combining the advantages of top-down and bottom-up strategies. This reduces dimensionality and obviates the need for the brute force of big data training. 
### 36.PedHunter: Occlusion Robust Pedestrian Detector in Crowded Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06826.pdf)
>  Pedestrian detection in crowded scenes is a challenging problem, because occlusion happens frequently among different pedestrians. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient detection network to hunt pedestrians in crowd scenes. The proposed method, namely PedHunter, introduces strong occlusion handling ability to existing region-based detection networks without bringing extra computations in the inference stage. Specifically, we design a mask-guided module to leverage the head information to enhance the feature representation learning of the backbone network. Moreover, we develop a strict classification criterion by improving the quality of positive samples during training to eliminate common false positives of pedestrian detection in crowded scenes. Besides, we present an occlusion-simulated data augmentation to enrich the pattern and quantity of occlusion samples to improve the occlusion robustness. As a consequent, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three pedestrian detection datasets including CityPersons, Caltech-USA and CrowdHuman. To facilitate further studies on the occluded pedestrian detection in surveillance scenes, we release a new pedestrian dataset, called SUR-PED, with a total of over 162k high-quality manually labeled instances in 10k images. The proposed dataset, source codes and trained models will be released. 
### 37.Scaling Object Detection by Transferring Classification Weights  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06804.pdf)
>  Large scale object detection datasets are constantly increasing their size in terms of the number of classes and annotations count. Yet, the number of object-level categories annotated in detection datasets is an order of magnitude smaller than image-level classification labels. State-of-the art object detection models are trained in a supervised fashion and this limits the number of object classes they can detect. In this paper, we propose a novel weight transfer network (WTN) to effectively and efficiently transfer knowledge from classification network's weights to detection network's weights to allow detection of novel classes without box supervision. We first introduce input and feature normalization schemes to curb the under-fitting during training of a vanilla WTN. We then propose autoencoder-WTN (AE-WTN) which uses reconstruction loss to preserve classification network's information over all classes in the target latent space to ensure generalization to novel classes. Compared to vanilla WTN, AE-WTN obtains absolute performance gains of 6% on two Open Images evaluation sets with 500 seen and 57 novel classes respectively, and 25% on a Visual Genome evaluation set with 200 novel classes. The code is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/xternalz/AE-WTN" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>. 
### 38.GradNet: Gradient-Guided Network for Visual Object Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06800.pdf)
>  The fully-convolutional siamese network based on template matching has shown great potentials in visual tracking. During testing, the template is fixed with the initial target feature and the performance totally relies on the general matching ability of the siamese network. However, this manner cannot capture the temporal variations of targets or background clutter. In this work, we propose a novel gradient-guided network to exploit the discriminative information in gradients and update the template in the siamese network through feed-forward and backward operations. Our algorithm performs feed-forward and backward operations to exploit the discriminative informaiton in gradients and capture the core attention of the target. To be specific, the algorithm can utilize the information from the gradient to update the template in the current frame. In addition, a template generalization training method is proposed to better use gradient information and avoid overfitting. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to exploit the information in the gradient for template update in siamese-based trackers. Extensive experiments on recent benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art trackers. 
### 39.OpenMPR: Recognize Places Using Multimodal Data for People with Visual Impairments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06795.pdf)
>  Place recognition plays a crucial role in navigational assistance, and is also a challenging issue of assistive technology. The place recognition is prone to erroneous localization owing to various changes between database and query images. Aiming at the wearable assistive device for visually impaired people, we propose an open-sourced place recognition algorithm OpenMPR, which utilizes the multimodal data to address the challenging issues of place recognition. Compared with conventional place recognition, the proposed OpenMPR not only leverages multiple effective descriptors, but also assigns different weights to those descriptors in image matching. Incorporating GNSS data into the algorithm, the cone-based sequence searching is used for robust place recognition. The experiments illustrate that the proposed algorithm manages to solve the place recognition issue in the real-world scenarios and surpass the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of assistive navigation performance. On the real-world testing dataset, the online OpenMPR achieves 88.7% precision at 100% recall without illumination changes, and achieves 57.8% precision at 99.3% recall with illumination changes.

### 40.Graph-guided Architecture Search for Real-time Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06793.pdf)
>  Designing a lightweight semantic segmentation network often requires researchers to find a trade-off between performance and speed, which is always empirical due to the limited interpretability of neural networks. In order to release researchers from these tedious mechanical trials, we propose a Graph-guided Architecture Search (GAS) pipeline to automatically search real-time semantic segmentation networks. Unlike previous works that use a simplified search space and stack a repeatable cell to form a network, we introduce a novel search mechanism with new search space where a lightweight model can be effectively explored through the cell-level diversity and latencyoriented constraint. Specifically, to produce the cell-level diversity, the cell-sharing constraint is eliminated through the cell-independent manner. Then a graph convolution network (GCN) is seamlessly integrated as a communication mechanism between cells. Finally, a latency-oriented constraint is endowed into the search process to balance the speed and performance. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate that GAS achieves new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and speed. In particular, on Cityscapes dataset, GAS achieves the new best performance of 73.3% mIoU with speed of 102 FPS on Titan Xp. 
### 41.Multitask Learning to Improve Egocentric Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06761.pdf)
>  In this work we employ multitask learning to capitalize on the structure that exists in related supervised tasks to train complex neural networks. It allows training a network for multiple objectives in parallel, in order to improve performance on at least one of them by capitalizing on a shared representation that is developed to accommodate more information than it otherwise would for a single task. We employ this idea to tackle action recognition in egocentric videos by introducing additional supervised tasks. We consider learning the verbs and nouns from which action labels consist of and predict coordinates that capture the hand locations and the gaze-based visual saliency for all the frames of the input video segments. This forces the network to explicitly focus on cues from secondary tasks that it might otherwise have missed resulting in improved inference. Our experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and EGTEA Gaze+ show consistent improvements when training with multiple tasks over the single-task baseline. Furthermore, in EGTEA Gaze+ we outperform the state-of-the-art in action recognition by 3.84%. Apart from actions, our method produces accurate hand and gaze estimations as side tasks, without requiring any additional input at test time other than the RGB video clips. 
### 42.A Full-Image Full-Resolution End-to-End-Trainable CNN Framework for Image Forgery Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06751.pdf)
>  Due to limited computational and memory resources, current deep learning models accept only rather small images in input, calling for preliminary image resizing. This is not a problem for high-level vision problems, where discriminative features are barely affected by resizing. On the contrary, in image forensics, resizing tends to destroy precious high-frequency details, impacting heavily on performance. One can avoid resizing by means of patch-wise processing, at the cost of renouncing whole-image analysis. In this work, we propose a CNN-based image forgery detection framework which makes decisions based on full-resolution information gathered from the whole image. Thanks to gradient checkpointing, the framework is trainable end-to-end with limited memory resources and weak (image-level) supervision, allowing for the joint optimization of all parameters. Experiments on widespread image forensics datasets prove the good performance of the proposed approach, which largely outperforms all baselines and all reference methods. 
### 43.Road Network Reconstruction from Satellite Images with Machine Learning Supported by Topological Methods  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06728.pdf)
>  Automatic Extraction of road network from satellite images is a goal that can benefit and even enable new technologies. Methods that combine machine learning (ML) and computer vision have been proposed in recent years which make the task semi-automatic by requiring the user to provide curated training samples. The process can be fully automatized if training samples can be produced algorithmically. Of course, this requires a robust algorithm that can reconstruct the road networks from satellite images reliably so that the output can be fed as training samples. In this work, we develop such a technique by infusing a persistence-guided discrete Morse based graph reconstruction algorithm into ML framework. <br>We elucidate our contributions in two phases. First, in a semi-automatic framework, we combine a discrete-Morse based graph reconstruction algorithm with an existing CNN framework to segment input satellite images. We show that this leads to reconstructions with better connectivity and less noise. Next, in a fully automatic framework, we leverage the power of the discrete-Morse based graph reconstruction algorithm to train a CNN from a collection of images without labelled data and use the same algorithm to produce the final output from the segmented images created by the trained CNN. We apply the discrete-Morse based graph reconstruction algorithm iteratively to improve the accuracy of the CNN. We show promising experimental results of this new framework on datasets from SpaceNet Challenge. 
### 44.Cascade RPN: Delving into High-Quality Region Proposal Network with Adaptive Convolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06720.pdf)
>  This paper considers an architecture referred to as Cascade Region Proposal Network (Cascade RPN) for improving the region-proposal quality and detection performance by \textit{systematically} addressing the limitation of the conventional RPN that \textit{heuristically defines} the anchors and \textit{aligns} the features to the anchors. First, instead of using multiple anchors with predefined scales and aspect ratios, Cascade RPN relies on a \textit{single anchor} per location and performs multi-stage refinement. Each stage is progressively more stringent in defining positive samples by starting out with an anchor-free metric followed by anchor-based metrics in the ensuing stages. Second, to attain alignment between the features and the anchors throughout the stages, \textit{adaptive convolution} is proposed that takes the anchors in addition to the image features as its input and learns the sampled features guided by the anchors. A simple implementation of a two-stage Cascade RPN achieves AR 13.4 points higher than that of the conventional RPN, surpassing any existing region proposal methods. When adopting to Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, Cascade RPN can improve the detection mAP by 3.1 and 3.5 points, respectively. The code is made publicly available at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/thangvubk/Cascade-RPN.git" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}. 
### 45.Progression Modelling for Online and Early Gesture Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06672.pdf)
>  Online and Early detection of gestures is crucial for building touchless gesture based interfaces. These interfaces should operate on a stream of video frames instead of the complete video and detect the presence of gestures at an earlier stage than post-completion for providing real time user experience. To achieve this, it is important to recognize the progression of the gesture across different stages so that appropriate responses can be triggered on reaching the desired execution stage. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task learning framework which models the progression of the gesture along with frame level recognition. The proposed framework recognizes the gestures at an early stage with high precision and also achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy of 87.8% which is closer to human accuracy of 88.4% on the NVIDIA gesture dataset in the offline configuration and advances the state-of-the-art by more than 4%. We also introduce tightly segmented annotations for the NVIDIA gesture dataset and setup a strong baseline for gesture localization for this dataset. We also evaluate our framework on the Montalbano dataset and report competitive results. 
### 46.Fuzzy Semantic Segmentation of Breast Ultrasound Image with Breast Anatomy Constraints  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06645.pdf)
>  Breast cancer is one of the most serious disease affects women's health. Due to low cost, portable, no radiation, and high efficiency, breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging is the most popular approach for diagnosing early breast cancer. However, ultrasound images are low resolution and poor quality, developing accurate detection system is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic segmentation algorithm consisting of two parts: fuzzy fully convolutional network and accurately fine-tuning post-processing based on breast anatomy constraints. In the first part, the image is preprocessed by contrast enhancement, and wavelet features are employed for image augmentation. A fuzzy membership function transforms the augmented BUS images into fuzzy domain. The features from convolutional layers are processed using fuzzy logic as well. The conditional random fields (CRFs) post-process the segmentation result. The location relation among the breast anatomy layers is utilized to improve the performance. The proposed method is applied to the dataset with 325 BUS images, and achieves state-of-art performance compared with that of existing methods with true positive rate 90.33%, false positive rate 9.00%, and intersection over union (IoU) 81.29% on tumor category, and overall intersection over union (mIoU) 80.47% over five categories: fat layer, mammary layer, muscle layer, background, and tumor. 
### 47.Joint Wasserstein Autoencoders for Aligning Multimodal Embeddings  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06635.pdf)
>  One of the key challenges in learning joint embeddings of multiple modalities, e.g. of images and text, is to ensure coherent cross-modal semantics that generalize across datasets. We propose to address this through joint Gaussian regularization of the latent representations. Building on Wasserstein autoencoders (WAEs) to encode the input in each domain, we enforce the latent embeddings to be similar to a Gaussian prior that is shared across the two domains, ensuring compatible continuity of the encoded semantic representations of images and texts. Semantic alignment is achieved through supervision from matching image-text pairs. To show the benefits of our semi-supervised representation, we apply it to cross-modal retrieval and phrase localization. We not only achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, but significantly better generalization across datasets, owing to the semantic continuity of the latent space. 
### 48.Line as object: datasets and framework for semantic line segment detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06591.pdf)
>  In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to the task of detecting semantic line segments from outdoor scenes. Semantic line segments are salient edges enclosed by two endpoints on an image with apparent semantic information, e.g., the boundary between a building roof and the sky (See Fig. 1). Semantic line segments can be efficiently parameterized and fill the gap between dense feature points and sparse objects to act as an effective landmarks in applications such as large-scale High Definition Mapping (HDM). With no existing benchmarks, we have built two new datasets carefully labeled by humans that contain over 6,000 images of semantic line segments. Semantic line segments have different appearance and layout patterns that are challenging for existing object detectors. We have proposed a Semantic Line Segment Detector (SLSD) together with an unified representation and a modified evaluation metric to better detect semantic line segments. SLSD trained on our proposed datasets is shown to perform effectively and efficiently. We have conducted excessive experiments to demonstrate semantic line segment detection task as a valid and challenging research topic. 
### 49.Blind Super-Resolution Kernel Estimation using an Internal-GAN  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06581.pdf)
>  Super resolution (SR) methods typically assume that the low-resolution (LR) image was downscaled from the unknown high-resolution (HR) image by a fixed 'ideal' downscaling kernel (e.g. Bicubic downscaling). However, this is rarely the case in real LR images, in contrast to synthetically generated SR datasets. When the assumed downscaling kernel deviates from the true one, the performance of SR methods significantly deteriorates. This gave rise to Blind-SR - namely, SR when the downscaling kernel ("SR-kernel") is unknown. It was further shown that the true SR-kernel is the one that maximizes the recurrence of patches across scales of the LR image. In this paper we show how this powerful cross-scale recurrence property can be realized using Deep Internal Learning. We introduce "KernelGAN", an image-specific Internal-GAN, which trains solely on the LR test image at test time, and learns its internal distribution of patches. Its Generator is trained to produce a downscaled version of the LR test image, such that its Discriminator cannot distinguish between the patch distribution of the downscaled image, and the patch distribution of the original LR image. The Generator, once trained, constitutes the downscaling operation with the correct image-specific SR-kernel. KernelGAN is fully unsupervised, requires no training data other than the input image itself, and leads to state-of-the-art results in Blind-SR when plugged into existing SR algorithms. 
### 50.Adversarial Attack on Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06500.pdf)
>  Deep learning models achieve impressive performance for skeleton-based human action recognition. However, the robustness of these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored due to their complex spatio-temporal nature that must represent sparse and discrete skeleton joints. This work presents the first adversarial attack on skeleton-based action recognition with graph convolutional networks. The proposed targeted attack, termed Constrained Iterative Attack for Skeleton Actions (CIASA), perturbs joint locations in an action sequence such that the resulting adversarial sequence preserves the temporal coherence, spatial integrity, and the anthropomorphic plausibility of the skeletons. CIASA achieves this feat by satisfying multiple physical constraints, and employing spatial skeleton realignments for the perturbed skeletons along with regularization of the adversarial skeletons with Generative networks. We also explore the possibility of semantically imperceptible localized attacks with CIASA, and succeed in fooling the state-of-the-art skeleton action recognition models with high confidence. CIASA perturbations show high transferability for black-box attacks. We also show that the perturbed skeleton sequences are able to induce adversarial behavior in the RGB videos created with computer graphics. A comprehensive evaluation with NTU and Kinetics datasets ascertains the effectiveness of CIASA for graph-based skeleton action recognition and reveals the imminent threat to the spatio-temporal deep learning tasks in general. 
### 51.F-Cooper: Feature based Cooperative Perception for Autonomous Vehicle Edge Computing System Using 3D Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06459.pdf)
>  Autonomous vehicles are heavily reliant upon their sensors to perfect the perception of surrounding environments, however, with the current state of technology, the data which a vehicle uses is confined to that from its own sensors. Data sharing between vehicles and/or edge servers is limited by the available network bandwidth and the stringent real-time constraints of autonomous driving applications. To address these issues, we propose a point cloud feature based cooperative perception framework (F-Cooper) for connected autonomous vehicles to achieve a better object detection precision. Not only will feature based data be sufficient for the training process, we also use the features' intrinsically small size to achieve real-time edge computing, without running the risk of congesting the network. Our experiment results show that by fusing features, we are able to achieve a better object detection result, around 10% improvement for detection within 20 meters and 30% for further distances, as well as achieve faster edge computing with a low communication delay, requiring 71 milliseconds in certain feature selections. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce feature-level data fusion to connected autonomous vehicles for the purpose of enhancing object detection and making real-time edge computing on inter-vehicle data feasible for autonomous vehicles. 
### 52.Spatio-spectral networks for color-texture analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06446.pdf)
>  Texture is one of the most-studied visual attribute for image characterization since the 1960s. However, most hand-crafted descriptors are monochromatic, focusing on the gray scale images and discarding the color information. In this context, this work focus on a new method for color texture analysis considering all color channels in a more intrinsic approach. Our proposal consists of modeling color images as directed complex networks that we named Spatio-Spectral Network (SSN). Its topology includes within-channel edges that cover spatial patterns throughout individual image color channels, while between-channel edges tackle spectral properties of channel pairs in an opponent fashion. Image descriptors are obtained through a concise topological characterization of the modeled network in a multiscale approach with radially symmetric neighborhoods. Experiments with four datasets cover several aspects of color-texture analysis, and results demonstrate that SSN overcomes all the compared literature methods, including known deep convolutional networks, and also has the most stable performance between datasets, achieving $98.5(\pm1.1)$ of average accuracy against $97.1(\pm1.3)$ of MCND and $96.8(\pm3.2)$ of AlexNet. Additionally, an experiment verifies the performance of the methods under different color spaces, where results show that SSN also has higher performance and robustness. 
### 53.MinneApple: A Benchmark Dataset for Apple Detection and Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06441.pdf)
>  In this work, we present a new dataset to advance the state-of-the-art in fruit detection, segmentation, and counting in orchard environments. While there has been significant recent interest in solving these problems, the lack of a unified dataset has made it difficult to compare results. We hope to enable direct comparisons by providing a large variety of high-resolution images acquired in orchards, together with human annotations of the fruit on trees. The fruits are labeled using polygonal masks for each object instance to aid in precise object detection, localization, and segmentation. Additionally, we provide data for patch-based counting of clustered fruits. Our dataset contains over 41, 000 annotated object instances in 1000 images. We present a detailed overview of the dataset together with baseline performance analysis for bounding box detection, segmentation, and fruit counting as well as representative results for yield estimation. We make this dataset publicly available and host a CodaLab challenge to encourage comparison of results on a common dataset.

### 54.Zero-Shot Action Recognition in Videos: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06423.pdf)
>  Zero-Shot Action Recognition has attracted attention in the last years, and many approaches have been proposed for recognition of objects, events, and actions in images and videos. There is a demand for methods that can classify instances from classes that are not present in the training of models, especially in the complex task of automatic video understanding, since collecting, annotating, and labeling videos are difficult and laborious tasks. We identify that there are many methods available in the literature, however, it is difficult to categorize which techniques can be considered state of the art. Despite the existence of some surveys about zero-shot action recognition in still images and experimental protocol, there is no work focusing on videos. Hence, in this paper, we present a survey of the methods comprising techniques to perform visual feature extraction and semantic feature extraction as well to learn the mapping between these features considering specifically zero-shot action recognition in videos. We also provide a complete description of datasets, experiments, and protocols, presenting open issues and directions for future work essential for the development of the computer vision research field. 
### 55.Image inpainting: A review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06399.pdf)
>  Although image inpainting, or the art of repairing the old and deteriorated images, has been around for many years, it has gained even more popularity because of the recent development in image processing techniques. With the improvement of image processing tools and the flexibility of digital image editing, automatic image inpainting has found important applications in computer vision and has also become an important and challenging topic of research in image processing. This paper is a brief review of the existing image inpainting approaches we first present a global vision on the existing methods for image inpainting. We attempt to collect most of the existing approaches and classify them into three categories, namely, sequential-based, CNN-based and GAN-based methods. In addition, for each category, a list of methods for the different types of distortion on the images is presented. Furthermore, collect a list of the available datasets and discuss these in our paper. This is a contribution for digital image inpainting researchers trying to look for the available datasets because there is a lack of datasets available for image inpainting. As the final step in this overview, we present the results of real evaluations of the three categories of image inpainting methods performed on the datasets used, for the different types of image distortion. In the end, we also present the evaluations metrics and discuss the performance of these methods in terms of these metrics. This overview can be used as a reference for image inpainting researchers, and it can also facilitate the comparison of the methods as well as the datasets used. The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of the three categories of image inpainting methods along with a list of available datasets that the researchers can use to evaluate their proposed methodology against. 
### 56.MuPNet: Multi-modal Predictive Coding Network for Place Recognition by Unsupervised Learning of Joint Visuo-Tactile Latent Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07201.pdf)
>  Extracting and binding salient information from different sensory modalities to determine common features in the environment is a significant challenge in robotics. Here we present MuPNet (Multi-modal Predictive Coding Network), a biologically plausible network architecture for extracting joint latent features from visuo-tactile sensory data gathered from a biomimetic mobile robot. In this study we evaluate MuPNet applied to place recognition as a simulated biomimetic robot platform explores visually aliased environments. The F1 scores demonstrate that its performance over prior hand-crafted sensory feature extraction techniques is equivalent under controlled conditions, with significant improvement when operating in novel environments. 
### 57.Identifying Pediatric Vascular Anomalies With Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07046.pdf)
>  Vascular anomalies, more colloquially known as birthmarks, affect up to 1 in 10 infants. Though many of these lesions self-resolve, some types can result in medical complications or disfigurement without proper diagnosis or management. Accurately diagnosing vascular anomalies is challenging for pediatricians and primary care physicians due to subtle visual differences and similarity to other pediatric dermatologic conditions. This can result in delayed or incorrect referrals for treatment. To address this problem, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically classify images of vascular anomalies and other pediatric skin conditions to aid physicians with diagnosis. We constructed a dataset of 21,681 clinical images, including data collected between 2002-2018 at Seattle Children's hospital as well as five dermatologist-curated online repositories, and built a taxonomy over vascular anomalies and other common pediatric skin lesions. The CNN achieved an average AUC of 0.9731 when ten-fold cross-validation was performed across a taxonomy of 12 classes. The classifier's average AUC and weighted F1 score was 0.9889 and 0.9732 respectively when evaluated on a previously unseen test set of six of these classes. Further, when used as an aid by pediatricians (n = 7), the classifier increased their average visual diagnostic accuracy from 73.10% to 91.67%. The classifier runs in real-time on a smartphone and has the potential to improve diagnosis of these conditions, particularly in resource-limited areas. 
### 58.Real-time 3-D Mapping with Estimating Acoustic Materials  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06998.pdf)
>  This paper proposes a real-time system integrating an acoustic material estimation from visual appearance and an on-the-fly mapping in the 3-dimension. The proposed method estimates the acoustic materials of surroundings in indoor scenes and incorporates them to a 3-D occupancy map, as a robot moves around the environment. To estimate the acoustic material from the visual cue, we apply the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation CNN network based on the assumption that the visual appearance and the acoustic materials have a strong association. Furthermore, we introduce an update policy to handle the material estimations during the online mapping process. As a result, our environment map with acoustic material can be used for sound-related robotics applications, such as sound source localization taking into account various acoustic propagation (e.g., reflection). 
### 59.Framelet Representation of Tensor Nuclear Norm for Third-Order Tensor Completion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06982.pdf)
>  The main aim of this paper is to develop a framelet representation of the tensor nuclear norm for third-order tensor completion. In the literature, the tensor nuclear norm can be computed by using tensor singular value decomposition based on the discrete Fourier transform matrix, and tensor completion can be performed by the minimization of the tensor nuclear norm which is the relaxation of the sum of matrix ranks from all Fourier transformed matrix frontal slices. These Fourier transformed matrix frontal slices are obtained by applying the discrete Fourier transform on the tubes of the original tensor. In this paper, we propose to employ the framelet representation of each tube so that a framelet transformed tensor can be constructed. Because of framelet basis redundancy, the representation of each tube is sparsely represented. When the matrix slices of the original tensor are highly correlated, we expect the corresponding sum of matrix ranks from all framelet transformed matrix frontal slices would be small, and the resulting tensor completion can be performed much better. The proposed minimization model is convex and global minimizers can be obtained. Numerical results on several types of multi-dimensional data (videos, multispectral images, and magnetic resonance imaging data) have tested and shown that the proposed method outperformed the other testing tensor completion methods. 
### 60.kPAM-SC: Generalizable Manipulation Planning using KeyPoint Affordance and Shape Completion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06980.pdf)
>  Manipulation planning is the task of computing robot trajectories that move a set of objects to their target configuration while satisfying physically feasibility. In contrast to existing works that assume known object templates, we are interested in manipulation planning for a category of objects with potentially unknown instances and large intra-category shape variation. To achieve it, we need an object representation with which the manipulation planner can reason about both the physical feasibility and desired object configuration, while being generalizable to novel instances. The widely-used pose representation is not suitable, as representing an object with a parameterized transformation from a fixed template cannot capture large intra-category shape variation. Hence, we propose a new hybrid object representation consisting of semantic keypoint and dense geometry (a point cloud or mesh) as the interface between the perception module and motion planner. Leveraging advances in learning-based keypoint detection and shape completion, both dense geometry and keypoints can be perceived from raw sensor input. Using the proposed hybrid object representation, we formulate the manipulation task as a motion planning problem which encodes both the object target configuration and physical feasibility for a category of objects. In this way, many existing manipulation planners can be generalized to categories of objects, and the resulting perception-to-action manipulation pipeline is robust to large intra-category shape variation. Extensive hardware experiments demonstrate our pipeline can produce robot trajectories that accomplish tasks with never-before-seen objects. 
### 61.A few filters are enough: Convolutional Neural Network for P300 Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06970.pdf)
>  In this paper, we aim to provide elements to contribute to the discussion about the usefulness of deep CNNs with several filters to solve both within-subject and cross-subject classification for single-trial P300 detection. To that end, we present SepConv1D, a simple Convolutional Neural Network architecture consisting of a depthwise separable 1D convolutional block followed by a Sigmoid classification block. Additionally, we present a one-layer Fully-Connected Neural Network with two neurons in the hidden layer to show the unnecessary of having complex architectures to solve the problem under analysis. We compare their performances against CNN-based state-of-the-art architectures. The experiments did not show a statistically significant difference between their AUC. Moreover, SepConv1D has the lowest number of parameters of all by far. This is important because simpler, cheaper, faster and, thus, more portable devices can be built. 
### 62.Multi-graph Fusion for Multi-view Spectral Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06940.pdf)
>  A panoply of multi-view clustering algorithms has been developed to deal with prevalent multi-view data. Among them, spectral clustering-based methods have drawn much attention and demonstrated promising results recently. Despite progress, there are still two fundamental questions that stay unanswered to date. First, how to fuse different views into one graph. More often than not, the similarities between samples may be manifested differently by different views. Many existing algorithms either simply take the average of multiple views or just learn a common graph. These simple approaches fail to consider the flexible local manifold structures of all views. Hence, the rich heterogeneous information is not fully exploited. Second, how to learn the explicit cluster structure. Most existing methods don't pay attention to the quality of the graphs and perform graph learning and spectral clustering separately. Those unreliable graphs might lead to suboptimal clustering results. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-view spectral clustering model which performs graph fusion and spectral clustering simultaneously. The fusion graph approximates the original graph of each individual view but maintains an explicit cluster structure. Experiments on four widely used data sets confirm the superiority of the proposed method. 
### 63.Self-Supervised Correspondence in Visuomotor Policy Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06933.pdf)
>  In this paper we explore using self-supervised correspondence for improving the generalization performance and sample efficiency of visuomotor policy learning. Prior work has primarily used approaches such as autoencoding, pose-based losses, and end-to-end policy optimization in order to train the visual portion of visuomotor policies. We instead propose an approach using self-supervised dense visual correspondence training, and show this enables visuomotor policy learning with surprisingly high generalization performance with modest amounts of data: using imitation learning, we demonstrate extensive hardware validation on challenging manipulation tasks with as few as 50 demonstrations. Our learned policies can generalize across classes of objects, react to deformable object configurations, and manipulate textureless symmetrical objects in a variety of backgrounds, all with closed-loop, real-time vision-based policies. Simulated imitation learning experiments suggest that correspondence training offers sample complexity and generalization benefits compared to autoencoding and end-to-end training. 
### 64.X-ToM: Explaining with Theory-of-Mind for Gaining Justified Human Trust  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06907.pdf)
>  We present a new explainable AI (XAI) framework aimed at increasing justified human trust and reliance in the AI machine through explanations. We pose explanation as an iterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human user. More concretely, the machine generates sequence of explanations in a dialog which takes into account three important aspects at each dialog turn: (a) human's intention (or curiosity); (b) human's understanding of the machine; and (c) machine's understanding of the human user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly modeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as human's mind as inferred by the machine. In other words, these explicit mental representations in ToM are incorporated to learn an optimal explanation policy that takes into account human's perception and beliefs. Furthermore, we also show that ToM facilitates in quantitatively measuring justified human trust in the machine by comparing all the three mental representations. <br>We applied our framework to three visual recognition tasks, namely, image classification, action recognition, and human body pose estimation. We argue that our ToM based explanations are practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to understand the internal workings of complex machine learning models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to derive explanations using ToM. Extensive human study experiments verify our hypotheses, showing that the proposed explanations significantly outperform the state-of-the-art XAI methods in terms of all the standard quantitative and qualitative XAI evaluation metrics including human trust, reliance, and explanation satisfaction. 
### 65.Brno Urban Dataset -- The New Data for Self-Driving Agents and Mapping Tasks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06897.pdf)
>  Autonomous driving is a dynamically growing field of research, where quality and amount of experimental data is critical. Although several rich datasets are available these days, the demands of researchers and technical possibilities are evolving. Through this paper, we bring a new dataset recorded in Brno, Czech Republic. It offers data from four WUXGA cameras, two 3D LiDARs, inertial measurement unit, infrared camera and especially differential RTK GNSS receiver with centimetre accuracy which, to the best knowledge of the authors, is not available from any other public dataset so far. In addition, all the data are precisely timestamped with sub-millisecond precision to allow wider range of applications. At the time of publishing of this paper, recordings of more than 350 km of rides in varying environment are shared at: https: //github.com/RoboticsBUT/Brno-Urban-Dataset. 
### 66.TiM-DNN: Ternary in Memory accelerator for Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06892.pdf)
>  The use of lower precision to perform computations has emerged as a popular technique to enable complex Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to be realized on energy-constrained platforms. In the quest for lower precision, studies to date have shown that ternary DNNs, which represent weights and activations by signed ternary values, represent a promising sweet spot, and achieve accuracy close to full-precision networks on complex tasks such as language modeling and image classification. We propose TiM-DNN, a programmable hardware accelerator that is specifically designed to execute state-of-the-art ternary DNNs. TiM-DNN supports various ternary representations including unweighted (-1,0,1), symmetric weighted (-a,0,a), and asymmetric weighted (-a,0,b) ternary systems. TiM-DNN is an in-memory accelerator designed using TiM tiles - specialized memory arrays that perform massively parallel signed vector-matrix multiplications on ternary values per access. TiM tiles are in turn composed of Ternary Processing Cells (TPCs), new bit-cells that function as both ternary storage units and signed scalar multiplication units. We evaluate an implementation of TiM-DNN in 32nm technology using an architectural simulator calibrated with SPICE simulations and RTL synthesis. TiM-DNN achieves a peak performance of 114 TOPs/s, consumes 0.9W power, and occupies 1.96mm2 chip area, representing a 300X and 388X improvement in TOPS/W and TOPS/mm2, respectively, compared to a state-of-the-art NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. In comparison to popular DNN accelerators, TiM-DNN achieves 55.2X-240X and 160X-291X improvement in TOPS/W and TOPS/mm2, respectively. We compare TiM-DNN with a well-optimized near-memory accelerator for ternary DNNs across a suite of state-of-the-art DNN benchmarks including both deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks, demonstrating 3.9x-4.7x improvement in system-level energy and 3.2x-4.2x speedup. 
### 67.Wasserstein Diffusion Tikhonov Regularization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06860.pdf)
>  We propose regularization strategies for learning discriminative models that are robust to in-class variations of the input data. We use the Wasserstein-2 geometry to capture semantically meaningful neighborhoods in the space of images, and define a corresponding input-dependent additive noise data augmentation model. Expanding and integrating the augmented loss yields an effective Tikhonov-type Wasserstein diffusion smoothness regularizer. This approach allows us to apply high levels of regularization and train functions that have low variability within classes but remain flexible across classes. We provide efficient methods for computing the regularizer at a negligible cost in comparison to training with adversarial data augmentation. Initial experiments demonstrate improvements in generalization performance under adversarial perturbations and also large in-class variations of the input data. 
### 68.Comparison of UNet, ENet, and BoxENet for Segmentation of Mast Cells in Scans of Histological Slices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06840.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks show high accuracy in the problem of semantic and instance segmentation of biomedical data. However, this approach is computationally expensive. The computational cost may be reduced with network simplification after training or choosing the proper architecture, which provides segmentation with less accuracy but does it much faster. In the present study, we analyzed the accuracy and performance of UNet and ENet architectures for the problem of semantic image segmentation. In addition, we investigated the ENet architecture by replacing the standard convolutional layer with box convolutions. The analysis performed on the original dataset consisted of histology slices with mast cells. These cells provide a region for segmentation with different types of borders, which vary from clearly visible to ragged. ENet was less accurate than UNet by only about 1-2\%, but ENet performance was 8-15 times faster than UNet one. The box convolution layer did not provide any benefits in semantic segmentation of the analyzed dataset. 
### 69.Deep Learning for Low-Field to High-Field MR: Image Quality Transfer with Probabilistic Decimation Simulator  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06763.pdf)
>  MR images scanned at low magnetic field ($&lt;1$T) have lower resolution in the slice direction and lower contrast, due to a relatively small signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than those from high field (typically 1.5T and 3T). We adapt the recent idea of Image Quality Transfer (IQT) to enhance very low-field structural images aiming to estimate the resolution, spatial coverage, and contrast of high-field images. Analogous to many learning-based image enhancement techniques, IQT generates training data from high-field scans alone by simulating low-field images through a pre-defined decimation model. However, the ground truth decimation model is not well-known in practice, and lack of its specification can bias the trained model, aggravating performance on the real low-field scans. In this paper we propose a probabilistic decimation simulator to improve robustness of model training. It is used to generate and augment various low-field images whose parameters are random variables and sampled from an empirical distribution related to tissue-specific SNR on a 0.36T scanner. The probabilistic decimation simulator is model-agnostic, that is, it can be used with any super-resolution networks. Furthermore we propose a variant of U-Net architecture to improve its learning performance. We show promising qualitative results from clinical low-field images confirming the strong efficacy of IQT in an important new application area: epilepsy diagnosis in sub-Saharan Africa where only low-field scanners are normally available. 
### 70.MSU-Net: Multiscale Statistical U-Net for Real-time 3D Cardiac MRI Video Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06726.pdf)
>  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential tool for MRI-guided surgery and real-time intervention. The MRI videos are expected to be segmented on-the-fly in real practice. However, existing segmentation methods would suffer from drastic accuracy loss when modified for speedup. In this work, we propose Multiscale Statistical U-Net (MSU-Net) for real-time 3D MRI video segmentation in cardiac surgical guidance. Our idea is to model the input samples as multiscale canonical form distributions for speedup, while the spatio-temporal correlation is still fully utilized. A parallel statistical U-Net is then designed to efficiently process these distributions. The fast data sampling and efficient parallel structure of MSU-Net endorse the fast and accurate inference. Compared with vanilla U-Net and a modified state-of-the-art method GridNet, our method achieves up to 268% and 237% speedup with 1.6% and 3.6% increased Dice scores. 
### 71.LRS-DAG: Low Resource Supervised Domain Adaptation with Generalization Across Domains  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06718.pdf)
>  Current state of the art methods in Domain Adaptation follow adversarial approaches, making training a challenge. Other non-adversarial methods learn mappings between source and target domains, to achieve reasonable performance. However, even these methods do not focus a key aspect of maintaining performance on the source domain, even after optimizing over the target domain. Additionally, there exist very few methods in low resource supervised domain adaptation. This work proposes a method, LRS-DAG, that aims to solve these current issues in the field. By adding a set of "encoder layers" which map the target domain to the source, and can be removed when dealing directly with the source data, the model learns to perform optimally on both domains. LRS-DAG is unique in the sense that a new algorithm for low resource domain adaptation, which maintains performance over the source, with a new metric for learning mappings has been introduced. 
### 72.Loam_livox: A fast, robust, high-precision LiDAR odometry and mapping package for LiDARs of small FoV  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06700.pdf)
>  LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM) has been playing an important role in autonomous vehicles, due to its ability to simultaneously localize the robot's pose and build high-precision, high-resolution maps of the surrounding environment. This enables autonomous navigation and safe path planning of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we present a robust, real-time LOAM algorithm for LiDARs with small FoV and irregular samplings. By taking effort on both front-end and back-end, we address several fundamental challenges arising from such LiDARs, and achieve better performance in both precision and efficiency compared to existing baselines. To share our findings and to make contributions to the community, we open source our codes on Github 
### 73.Automated Multiclass Cardiac Volume Segmentation and Model Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06685.pdf)
>  Many strides have been made in semantic segmentation of multiple classes within an image. This has been largely due to advancements in deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Features within a CNN are automatically learned during training, which allows for the abstraction of semantic information within the images. These deep learning models are powerful enough to handle the segmentation of multiple classes without the need for multiple networks. Despite these advancements, few attempts have been made to automatically segment multiple anatomical features within medical imaging datasets obtained from CT or MRI scans. This offers a unique challenge because of the three dimensional nature of medical imaging data. In order to alleviate the 3D modality problem, we propose a multi-axis ensemble method, applied to a dataset of 4-cardiac-chamber segmented CT scans. Inspired by the typical three-axis view used by humans, this technique aims to maximize the 3D spatial information afforded to the model, while remaining efficient for consumer grade inference hardware. Multi-axis ensembling along with pragmatic voxel preprocessing have shown in our experiments to greatly increase the mean intersection over union of our predictions over the complete DICOM dataset. 
### 74.3D Kidneys and Kidney Tumor Semantic Segmentation using Boundary-Aware Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06684.pdf)
>  Automated segmentation of kidneys and kidney tumors is an important step in quantifying the tumor's morphometrical details to monitor the progression of the disease and accurately compare decisions regarding the kidney tumor treatment. Manual delineation techniques are often tedious, error-prone and require expert knowledge for creating unambiguous representation of kidneys and kidney tumors segmentation. In this work, we propose an end-to-end boundary aware fully Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for reliable kidney and kidney tumor semantic segmentation from arterial phase abdominal 3D CT scans. We propose a segmentation network consisting of an encoder-decoder architecture that specifically accounts for organ and tumor edge information by devising a dedicated boundary branch supervised by edge-aware loss terms. We have evaluated our model on 2019 MICCAI KiTS Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge dataset and our method has achieved dice scores of 0.9742 and 0.8103 for kidney and tumor repetitively and an overall composite dice score of 0.8923. 
### 75.musicnn: Pre-trained convolutional neural networks for music audio tagging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06654.pdf)
>  Pronounced as "musician", the musicnn library contains a set of pre-trained musically motivated convolutional neural networks for music audio tagging: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/jordipons/musicnn" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>. This repository also includes some pre-trained vgg-like baselines. These models can be used as out-of-the-box music audio taggers, as music feature extractors, or as pre-trained models for transfer learning. <br>We also provide the code to train the aforementioned models: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/jordipons/musicnn-training" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>. This framework also allows implementing novel models. For example, a musically motivated convolutional neural network with an attention-based output layer (instead of the temporal pooling layer) can achieve state-of-the-art results for music audio tagging: 90.77 ROC-AUC / 38.61 PR-AUC on the MagnaTagATune dataset --- and 88.81 ROC-AUC / 31.51 PR-AUC on the Million Song Dataset. 
### 76.3D Deep Affine-Invariant Shape Learning for Brain MR Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06629.pdf)
>  Recent advancements in medical image segmentation techniques have achieved compelling results. However, most of the widely used approaches do not take into account any prior knowledge about the shape of the biomedical structures being segmented. More recently, some works have presented approaches to incorporate shape information. However, many of them are indeed introducing more parameters to the segmentation network to learn the general features, which any segmentation network is able learn, instead of specifically shape features. In this paper, we present a novel approach that seamlessly integrates the shape information into the segmentation network. Experiments on human brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that our approach can achieve a lower Hausdorff distance and higher Dice coefficient than the state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 77.Tapering Analysis of Airways with Bronchiectasis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06604.pdf)
>  Bronchiectasis is the permanent dilation of airways. Patients with the disease can suffer recurrent exacerbations, reducing their quality of life. The gold standard to diagnose and monitor bronchiectasis is accomplished by inspection of chest computed tomography (CT) scans. A clinician examines the broncho-arterial ratio to determine if an airway is brochiectatic. The visual analysis assumes the blood vessel diameter remains constant, although this assumption is disputed in the literature. We propose a simple measurement of tapering along the airways to diagnose and monitor bronchiectasis. To this end, we constructed a pipeline to measure the cross-sectional area along the airways at contiguous intervals, starting from the carina to the most distal point observable. Using a phantom with calibrated 3D printed structures, the precision and accuracy of our algorithm extends to the sub voxel level. The tapering measurement is robust to bifurcations along the airway and was applied to chest CT images acquired in clinical practice. The result is a statistical difference in tapering rate between airways with bronchiectasis and controls. Our code is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/quan14/AirwayTaperingInCT" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>. 
### 78.Deep Robotic Prediction with hierarchical RGB-D Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06585.pdf)
>  Robotic arm grasping is a fundamental operation in robotic control task goals. Most current methods for robotic grasping focus on RGB-D policy in the table surface scenario or 3D point cloud analysis and inference in the 3D space. Comparing to these methods, we propose a novel real-time multimodal hierarchical encoder-decoder neural network that fuses RGB and depth data to realize robotic humanoid grasping in 3D space with only partial observation. The quantification of raw depth data's uncertainty and depth estimation fusing RGB is considered. We develop a general labeling method to label ground-truth on common RGB-D datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness and performance of our method on a physical robot setup and our method achieves over 90\% success rate in both table surface and 3D space scenarios. 
### 79.Multi-Perspective, Simultaneous Embedding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06485.pdf)
>  We describe a method for simultaneous visualization of multiple pairwise distances in 3 dimensional (3D) space. Given the distance matrices that correspond to 2 dimensional projections of a 3 dimensional object (dataset) the goal is to recover the 3 dimensional object (dataset). We propose an approach that uses 3D to place the points, along with projections (planes) that preserve each of the given distance matrices. Our multi-perspective, simultaneous embedding (MPSE) method is based on non-linear dimensionality reduction that generalizes multidimensional scaling. We consider two versions of the problem: in the first one we are given the input distance matrices and the projections (e.g., if we have 3 different projections we can use the three orthogonal directions of the unit cube). In the second version of the problem we also compute the best projections as part of the optimization. We experimentally evaluate MPSE using synthetic datasets that illustrate the quality of the resulting solutions. Finally, we provide a functional prototype which implements both settings. 
### 80.Coupling Rendering and Generative Adversarial Networks for Artificial SAS Image Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06436.pdf)
>  Acquisition of Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) datasets is bottlenecked by the costly deployment of SAS imaging systems, and even when data acquisition is possible,the data is often skewed towards containing barren seafloor rather than objects of interest. We present a novel pipeline, called SAS GAN, which couples an optical renderer with a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthesize realistic SAS images of targets on the seafloor. This coupling enables high levels of SAS image realism while enabling control over image geometry and parameters. We demonstrate qualitative results by presenting examples of images created with our pipeline. We also present quantitative results through the use of t-SNE and the Fréchet Inception Distance to argue that our generated SAS imagery potentially augments SAS datasets more effectively than an off-the-shelf GAN. 
### 81.Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting Reconstruction Using Recurrent Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06395.pdf)
>  Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is an imaging technique acquiring unique time signals for different tissues. Although the acquisition is highly accelerated, the reconstruction time remains a problem, as the state-of-the-art template matching compares every signal with a set of possible signals. To overcome this limitation, deep learning based approaches, e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed. In this work, we investigate the applicability of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for this reconstruction problem, as the signals are correlated in time. Compared to previous methods based on CNNs, RNN models yield significantly improved results using in-vivo data.
