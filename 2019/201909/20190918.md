### 1.An Internal Learning Approach to Video Inpainting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07957.pdf)
>  We propose a novel video inpainting algorithm that simultaneously hallucinates missing appearance and motion (optical flow) information, building upon the recent 'Deep Image Prior' (DIP) that exploits convolutional network architectures to enforce plausible texture in static images. In extending DIP to video we make two important contributions. First, we show that coherent video inpainting is possible without a priori training. We take a generative approach to inpainting based on internal (within-video) learning without reliance upon an external corpus of visual data to train a one-size-fits-all model for the large space of general videos. Second, we show that such a framework can jointly generate both appearance and flow, whilst exploiting these complementary modalities to ensure mutual consistency. We show that leveraging appearance statistics specific to each video achieves visually plausible results whilst handling the challenging problem of long-term consistency. 
### 2.ProtoGAN: Towards Few Shot Learning for Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07945.pdf)
>  Few-shot learning (FSL) for action recognition is a challenging task of recognizing novel action categories which are represented by few instances in the training data. In a more generalized FSL setting (G-FSL), both seen as well as novel action categories need to be recognized. Conventional classifiers suffer due to inadequate data in FSL setting and inherent bias towards seen action categories in G-FSL setting. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel ProtoGAN framework which synthesizes additional examples for novel categories by conditioning a conditional generative adversarial network with class prototype vectors. These class prototype vectors are learnt using a Class Prototype Transfer Network (CPTN) from examples of seen categories. Our synthesized examples for a novel class are semantically similar to real examples belonging to that class and is used to train a model exhibiting better generalization towards novel classes. We support our claim by performing extensive experiments on three datasets: UCF101, HMDB51 and Olympic-Sports. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the results for G-FSL and provide a strong benchmark for future research. We also outperform the state-of-the-art method in FSL for all the aforementioned datasets. 
### 3.Multi-mapping Image-to-Image Translation via Learning Disentanglement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07877.pdf)
>  Recent advances of image-to-image translation focus on learning the one-to-many mapping from two aspects: multi-modal translation and multi-domain translation. However, the existing methods only consider one of the two perspectives, which makes them unable to solve each other's problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel unified model, which bridges these two objectives. First, we disentangle the input images into the latent representations by an encoder-decoder architecture with a conditional adversarial training in the feature space. Then, we encourage the generator to learn multi-mappings by a random cross-domain translation. As a result, we can manipulate different parts of the latent representations to perform multi-modal and multi-domain translations simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. 
### 4.Multimodal Multitask Representation Learning for Pathology Biobank Metadata Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07846.pdf)
>  Metadata are general characteristics of the data in a well-curated and condensed format, and have been proven to be useful for decision making, knowledge discovery, and also heterogeneous data organization of biobank. Among all data types in the biobank, pathology is the key component of the biobank and also serves as the gold standard of diagnosis. To maximize the utility of biobank and allow the rapid progress of biomedical science, it is essential to organize the data with well-populated pathology metadata. However, manual annotation of such information is tedious and time-consuming. In the study, we develop a multimodal multitask learning framework to predict four major slide-level metadata of pathology images. The framework learns generalizable representations across tissue slides, pathology reports, and case-level structured data. We demonstrate improved performance across all four tasks with the proposed method compared to a single modal single task baseline on two test sets, one external test set from a distinct data source (TCGA) and one internal held-out test set (TTH). In the test sets, the performance improvements on the averaged area under receiver operating characteristic curve across the four tasks are 16.48% and 9.05% on TCGA and TTH, respectively. Such pathology metadata prediction system may be adopted to mitigate the effort of expert annotation and ultimately accelerate the data-driven research by better utilization of the pathology biobank. 
### 5.AdaptIS: Adaptive Instance Selection Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07829.pdf)
>  We present Adaptive Instance Selection network architecture for class-agnostic instance segmentation. Given an input image and a point $(x, y)$, it generates a mask for the object located at $(x, y)$. The network adapts to the input point with a help of AdaIN layers, thus producing different masks for different objects on the same image. AdaptIS generates pixel-accurate object masks, therefore it accurately segments objects of complex shape or severely occluded ones. AdaptIS can be easily combined with standard semantic segmentation pipeline to perform panoptic segmentation. To illustrate the idea, we perform experiments on a challenging toy problem with difficult occlusions. Then we extensively evaluate the method on panoptic segmentation benchmarks. We obtain state-of-the-art results on Cityscapes and Mapillary even without pretraining on COCO, and show competitive results on a challenging COCO dataset. The source code of the method and the trained models are available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/saic-vul/adaptis" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>. 
### 6.Weak Edge Identification Nets for Ocean Front Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07827.pdf)
>  The ocean front has an important impact in many areas, it is meaningful to obtain accurate ocean front positioning, therefore, ocean front detection is a very important task. However, the traditional edge detection algorithm does not detect the weak edge information of the ocean front very well. In response to this problem, we collected relevant ocean front gradient images and found relevant experts to calibrate the ocean front data to obtain groundtruth, and proposed a weak edge identification nets(WEIN) for ocean front detection. Whether it is qualitative or quantitative, our methods perform best. The method uses a welltrained deep learning model to accurately extract the ocean front from the ocean front gradient image. The detection network is divided into multiple stages, and the final output is a multi-stage output image fusion. The method uses the stochastic gradient descent and the correlation loss function to obtain a good ocean front image output. 
### 7.Learning Deformable Point Set Registration with Regularized Dynamic Graph CNNs for Large Lung Motion in COPD Patients  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07818.pdf)
>  Deformable registration continues to be one of the key challenges in medical image analysis. While iconic registration methods have started to benefit from the recent advances in medical deep learning, the same does not yet apply for the registration of point sets, e.g. registration based on surfaces, keypoints or landmarks. This is mainly due to the restriction of the convolution operator in modern CNNs to densely gridded input. However, with the newly developed methods from the field of geometric deep learning suitable tools are now emerging, which enable powerful analysis of medical data on irregular domains. In this work, we present a new method that enables the learning of regularized feature descriptors with dynamic graph CNNs. By incorporating the learned geometric features as prior probabilities into the well-established coherent point drift (CPD) algorithm, formulated as differentiable network layer, we establish an end-to-end framework for robust registration of two point sets. Our approach is evaluated on the challenging task of aligning keypoints extracted from lung CT scans in inhale and exhale states with large deformations and without any additional intensity information. Our results indicate that the inherent geometric structure of the extracted keypoints is sufficient to establish descriptive point features, which yield a significantly improved performance and robustness of our registration framework. 
### 8.Learn to Segment Organs with a Few Bounding Boxes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07809.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation is an import task in the medical field to identify the exact extent and orientation of significant structures like organs and pathology. Deep neural networks can perform this task well by leveraging the information from a large well-labeled data-set. This paper aims to present a method that mitigates the necessity of an extensive well-labeled data-set. This method also addresses semi-supervision by enabling segmentation based on bounding box annotations, avoiding the need for full pixel-level annotations. The network presented consists of a single U-Net based unbranched architecture that generates a few-shot segmentation for an unseen human organ using just 4 example annotations of that specific organ. The network is trained by alternately minimizing the nearest neighbor loss for prototype learning and a weighted cross-entropy loss for segmentation learning to perform a fast 3D segmentation with a median score of 54.64%. 
### 9.Chinese Street View Text: Large-scale Chinese Text Reading with Partially Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07808.pdf)
>  Most existing text reading benchmarks make it difficult to evaluate the performance of more advanced deep learning models in large vocabularies due to the limited amount of training data. To address this issue, we introduce a new large-scale text reading benchmark dataset named Chinese Street View Text (C-SVT) with 430,000 street view images, which is at least 14 times as large as the existing Chinese text reading benchmarks. To recognize Chinese text in the wild while keeping large-scale datasets labeling cost-effective, we propose to annotate one part of the CSVT dataset (30,000 images) in locations and text labels as full annotations and add 400,000 more images, where only the corresponding text-of-interest in the regions is given as weak annotations. To exploit the rich information from the weakly annotated data, we design a text reading network in a partially supervised learning framework, which enables to localize and recognize text, learn from fully and weakly annotated data simultaneously. To localize the best matched text proposals from weakly labeled images, we propose an online proposal matching module incorporated in the whole model, spotting the keyword regions by sharing parameters for end-to-end training. Compared with fully supervised training algorithms, this model can improve the end-to-end recognition performance remarkably by 4.03% in F-score at the same labeling cost. The proposed model can also achieve state-of-the-art results on the ICDAR 2017-RCTW dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed partially supervised learning framework. 
### 10.A machine vision meta-algorithm for automated recognition of underwater objects using sidescan sonar imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07763.pdf)
>  This paper details a new method to recognize and detect underwater objects in real-time sidescan sonar data imagery streams, with case-studies of applications for underwater archeology, and ghost fishing gear retrieval. We first synthesize images from sidescan data, apply geometric and radiometric corrections, then use 2D feature detection algorithms to identify point clouds of descriptive visual microfeatures such as corners and edges in the sonar images. We then apply a clustering algorithm on the feature point clouds to group feature sets into regions of interest, reject false positives, yielding a georeferenced inventory of objects. 
### 11.ICDAR 2019 Competition on Large-scale Street View Text with Partial Labeling -- RRC-LSVT  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07741.pdf)
>  Robust text reading from street view images provides valuable information for various applications. Performance improvement of existing methods in such a challenging scenario heavily relies on the amount of fully annotated training data, which is costly and in-efficient to obtain. To scale up the amount of training data while keeping the labeling procedure cost-effective, this competition introduces a new challenge on Large-scale Street View Text with Partial Labeling (LSVT), providing 50, 000 and 400, 000 images in full and weak annotations, respectively. This competition aims to explore the abilities of state-of-the-art methods to detect and recognize text instances from large-scale street view images, closing the gap between research benchmarks and real applications. During the competition period, a total of 41 teams participated in the two proposed tasks with 132 valid submissions, i.e., text detection and end-to-end text spotting. This paper includes dataset descriptions, task definitions, evaluation protocols and results summaries of the ICDAR 2019-LSVT challenge. 
### 12.An Image Based Visual Servo Approach with Deep Learning for Robotic Manipulation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07727.pdf)
>  Aiming at the difficulty of extracting image features and estimating the Jacobian matrix in image based visual servo, this paper proposes an image based visual servo approach with deep learning. With the powerful learning capabilities of convolutional neural networks(CNN), autonomous learning to extract features from images and fitting the nonlinear relationships from image space to task space is achieved, which can greatly facilitate the image based visual servo procedure. Based on the above ideas a two-stream network based on convolutional neural network is designed and the corresponding control scheme is proposed to realize the four degrees of freedom visual servo of the robot manipulator. Collecting images of observed target under different pose parameters of the manipulator as training samples for CNN, the trained network can be used to estimate the nonlinear relationship from 2D image space to 3D Cartesian space. The two-stream network takes the current image and the desirable image as inputs and makes them equal to guide the manipulator to the desirable pose. The effectiveness of the approach is verified with experimental results. 
### 13.Building Change Detection for Remote Sensing Images Using a Dual Task Constrained Deep Siamese Convolutional Network Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07726.pdf)
>  In recent years, building change detection methods have made great progress by introducing deep learning, but they still suffer from the problem of the extracted features not being discriminative enough, resulting in incomplete regions and irregular boundaries. To tackle this problem, we propose a dual task constrained deep Siamese convolutional network (DTCDSCN) model, which contains three sub-networks: a change detection network and two semantic segmentation networks. DTCDSCN can accomplish both change detection and semantic segmentation at the same time, which can help to learn more discriminative object-level features and obtain a complete change detection map. Furthermore, we introduce a dual attention module (DAM) to exploit the interdependencies between channels and spatial positions, which improves the feature representation. We also improve the focal loss function to suppress the sample imbalance problem. The experimental results obtained with the WHU building dataset show that the proposed method is effective for building change detection and achieves a state-of-the-art performance in terms of four metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, and intersection over union. 
### 14.Deep Point-wise Prediction for Action Temporal Proposal  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07725.pdf)
>  Detecting actions in videos is an important yet challenging task. Previous works usually utilize (a) sliding window paradigms, or (b) per-frame action scoring and grouping to enumerate the possible temporal locations. Their performances are also limited to the designs of sliding windows or grouping strategies. In this paper, we present a simple and effective method for temporal action proposal generation, named Deep Point-wise Prediction (DPP). DPP simultaneously predicts the action existing possibility and the corresponding temporal locations, without the utilization of any handcrafted sliding window or grouping. The whole system is end-to-end trained with joint loss of temporal action proposal classification and location prediction. We conduct extensive experiments to verify its effectiveness, generality and robustness on standard THUMOS14 dataset. DPP runs more than 1000 frames per second, which largely satisfies the real-time requirement.

### 15.DS-PASS: Detail-Sensitive Panoramic Annular Semantic Segmentation through SwaftNet for Surrounding Sensing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07721.pdf)
>  Semantically interpreting the traffic scene is crucial for autonomous transportation and robotics. However, state-of-the-art semantic segmentation pipelines are dominantly designed to work with pinhole cameras and train with narrow Field-of-View (FoV) images. In this sense, the perception capacity is severely limited to offer higher-level of confidence for upstream navigation tasks. In this paper, we propose a network adaptation framework to achieve Panoramic Annular Semantic Segmentation (PASS), which allows to re-use conventional pinhole-view image datasets, enabling modern segmentation networks to comfortably adapt to panoramic images. Specifically, we adapt our proposed SwaftNet to enhance the sensitivity to details by implementing attention-based lateral connections between the detail-critical encoder layers and the context-critical decoder layers. We benchmark the performance of efficient segmenters on panoramic segmentation with our extended PASS dataset, demonstrating that the proposed real-time SwaftNet outperforms state-of-the-art efficient networks. Furthermore, we assess real-world performance when deploying the Detail-Sensitive PASS (DS-PASS) system on a mobile robot and an instrumented vehicle, as well as the benefit of panoramic semantics for visual odometry, showing the robustness and potential to support diverse navigational applications. 
### 16.re-OBJ: Jointly Learning the Foreground and Background for Object Instance Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07704.pdf)
>  Conventional approaches to object instance re-identification rely on matching appearances of the target objects among a set of frames. However, learning appearances of the objects alone might fail when there are multiple objects with similar appearance or multiple instances of same object class present in the scene. This paper proposes that partial observations of the background can be utilized to aid in the object re-identification task for a rigid scene, especially a rigid environment with a lot of reoccurring identical models of objects. Using an extension to the Mask R-CNN architecture, we learn to encode the important and distinct information in the background jointly with the foreground relevant to rigid real-world scenarios such as an indoor environment where objects are static and the camera moves around the scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our joint visual feature in the re-identification of objects in the ScanNet dataset and show a relative improvement of around 28.25% in the rank-1 accuracy over the deepSort method. 
### 17.Task-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation for 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07701.pdf)
>  Monocular depth estimation enables 3D perception from a single 2D image, thus attracting much research attention for years. Almost all methods treat foreground and background regions (``things and stuff'') in an image equally. However, not all pixels are equal. Depth of foreground objects plays a crucial role in 3D object recognition and localization. To date how to boost the depth prediction accuracy of foreground objects is rarely discussed. In this paper, we first analyse the data distributions and interaction of foreground and background, then propose the foreground-background separated monocular depth estimation (ForeSeE) method, to estimate the foreground depth and background depth using separate optimization objectives and depth decoders. Our method significantly improves the depth estimation performance on foreground objects. Applying ForeSeE to 3D object detection, we achieve 7.5 AP gains and set new state-of-the-art results among other monocular methods. 
### 18.Learning to Find Hydrological Corrections  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07685.pdf)
>  High resolution Digital Elevation models, such as the (Big) grid terrain model of Denmark with more than 200 billion measurements, is a basic requirement for water flow modelling and flood risk analysis. However, a large number of modifications often need to be made to even very accurate terrain models, such as the Danish model, before they can be used in realistic flow modeling. These modifications include removal of bridges, which otherwise will act as dams in flow modeling, and inclusion of culverts that transport water underneath roads. In fact, the danish model is accompanied by a detailed set of hydrological corrections for the digital elevation model. However, producing these hydrological corrections is a very slow an expensive process, since it is to a large extent done manually and often with local input. This also means that corrections can be of varying quality. In this paper we propose a new algorithmic apporach based on machine learning and convolutional neural networks for automatically detecting hydrological corrections for such large terrain data. Our model is able to detect most hydrological corrections known for the danish model and quite a few more that should have been included in the original list. 
### 19.Spatio-Semantic ConvNet-Based Visual Place Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07671.pdf)
>  We present a Visual Place Recognition system that follows the two-stage format common to image retrieval pipelines. The system encodes images of places by employing the activations of different layers of a pre-trained, off-the-shelf, VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. In the first stage of our method and given a query image of a place, a number of top candidate images is retrieved from a previously stored database of places. In the second stage, we propose an exhaustive comparison of the query image against these candidates by encoding semantic and spatial information in the form of CNN features. Results from our approach outperform by a large margin state-of-the-art visual place recognition methods on five of the most commonly used benchmark datasets. The performance gain is especially remarkable on the most challenging datasets, with more than a twofold recognition improvement with respect to the latest published work. 
### 20.Progressive Fusion for Unsupervised Binocular Depth Estimation using Cycled Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07667.pdf)
>  Recent deep monocular depth estimation approaches based on supervised regression have achieved remarkable performance. However, they require costly ground truth annotations during training. To cope with this issue, in this paper we present a novel unsupervised deep learning approach for predicting depth maps. We introduce a new network architecture, named Progressive Fusion Network (PFN), that is specifically designed for binocular stereo depth estimation. This network is based on a multi-scale refinement strategy that combines the information provided by both stereo views. In addition, we propose to stack twice this network in order to form a cycle. This cycle approach can be interpreted as a form of data-augmentation since, at training time, the network learns both from the training set images (in the forward half-cycle) but also from the synthesized images (in the backward half-cycle). The architecture is jointly trained with adversarial learning. Extensive experiments on the publicly available datasets KITTI, Cityscapes and ApolloScape demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model which is competitive with other unsupervised deep learning methods for depth prediction. 
### 21.Thanks for Nothing: Predicting Zero-Valued Activations with Lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07636.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) introduce state-of-the-art results for various tasks with the price of high computational demands. Inspired by the observation that spatial correlation exists in CNN output feature maps (ofms), we propose a method to dynamically predict whether ofm activations are zero-valued or not according to their neighboring activation values, thereby avoiding zero-valued activations and reducing the number of convolution operations. We implement the zero activation predictor (ZAP) with a lightweight CNN, which imposes negligible overheads and is easy to deploy and train. Furthermore, the same ZAP can be tuned to many different operating points along the accuracy-savings trade-off curve. For example, using VGG-16 and the ILSVRC-2012 dataset, different operating points achieve a reduction of 23.5% and 32.3% multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations with top-1/top-5 accuracy degradation of 0.3%/0.1% and 1%/0.5% without fine-tuning, respectively. Considering one-epoch fine-tuning, 41.7% MAC operations may be reduced with 1.1%/0.52% accuracy degradation. 
### 22.Deep End-to-End Alignment and Refinement for Time-of-Flight RGB-D Module  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07623.pdf)
>  Recently, it is increasingly popular to equip mobile RGB cameras with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors for active depth sensing. However, for off-the-shelf ToF sensors, one must tackle two problems in order to obtain high-quality depth with respect to the RGB camera, namely 1) online calibration and alignment; and 2) complicated error correction for ToF depth sensing. In this work, we propose a framework for jointly alignment and refinement via deep learning. First, a cross-modal optical flow between the RGB image and the ToF amplitude image is estimated for alignment. The aligned depth is then refined via an improved kernel predicting network that performs kernel normalization and applies the bias prior to the dynamic convolution. To enrich our data for end-to-end training, we have also synthesized a dataset using tools from computer graphics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art for ToF refinement. 
### 23.Cycle-consistent Conditional Adversarial Transfer Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07618.pdf)
>  Domain adaptation investigates the problem of cross-domain knowledge transfer where the labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain have distinctive data distributions. Recently, adversarial training have been successfully applied to domain adaptation and achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, there is still a fatal weakness existing in current adversarial models which is raised from the equilibrium challenge of adversarial training. Specifically, although most of existing methods are able to confuse the domain discriminator, they cannot guarantee that the source domain and target domain are sufficiently similar. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named {\it cycle-consistent conditional adversarial transfer networks} (3CATN) to handle this issue. Our approach takes care of the domain alignment by leveraging adversarial training. Specifically, we condition the adversarial networks with the cross-covariance of learned features and classifier predictions to capture the multimodal structures of data distributions. However, since the classifier predictions are not certainty information, a strong condition with the predictions is risky when the predictions are not accurate. We, therefore, further propose that the truly domain-invariant features should be able to be translated from one domain to the other. To this end, we introduce two feature translation losses and one cycle-consistent loss into the conditional adversarial domain adaptation networks. Extensive experiments on both classical and large-scale datasets verify that our model is able to outperform previous state-of-the-arts with significant improvements. 
### 24.Alleviating Feature Confusion for Generative Zero-shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07615.pdf)
>  Lately, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been successfully applied to zero-shot learning (ZSL) and achieved state-of-the-art performance. By synthesizing virtual unseen visual features, GAN-based methods convert the challenging ZSL task into a supervised learning problem. However, GAN-based ZSL methods have to train the generator on the seen categories and further apply it to unseen instances. An inevitable issue of such a paradigm is that the synthesized unseen features are prone to seen references and incapable to reflect the novelty and diversity of real unseen instances. In a nutshell, the synthesized features are confusing. One cannot tell unseen categories from seen ones using the synthesized features. As a result, the synthesized features are too subtle to be classified in generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) which involves both seen and unseen categories at the test stage. In this paper, we first introduce the feature confusion issue. Then, we propose a new feature generating network, named alleviating feature confusion GAN (AFC-GAN), to challenge the issue. Specifically, we present a boundary loss which maximizes the decision boundary of seen categories and unseen ones. Furthermore, a novel metric named feature confusion score (FCS) is proposed to quantify the feature confusion. Extensive experiments on five widely used datasets verify that our method is able to outperform previous state-of-the-arts under both ZSL and GZSL protocols. 
### 25.Improving the Learning of Multi-column Convolutional Neural Network for Crowd Counting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07608.pdf)
>  Tremendous variation in the scale of people/head size is a critical problem for crowd counting. To improve the scale invariance of feature representation, recent works extensively employ Convolutional Neural Networks with multi-column structures to handle different scales and resolutions. However, due to the substantial redundant parameters in columns, existing multi-column networks invariably exhibit almost the same scale features in different columns, which severely affects counting accuracy and leads to overfitting. In this paper, we attack this problem by proposing a novel Multi-column Mutual Learning (McML) strategy. It has two main innovations: 1) A statistical network is incorporated into the multi-column framework to estimate the mutual information between columns, which can approximately indicate the scale correlation between features from different columns. By minimizing the mutual information, each column is guided to learn features with different image scales. 2) We devise a mutual learning scheme that can alternately optimize each column while keeping the other columns fixed on each mini-batch training data. With such asynchronous parameter update process, each column is inclined to learn different feature representation from others, which can efficiently reduce the parameter redundancy and improve generalization ability. More remarkably, McML can be applied to all existing multi-column networks and is end-to-end trainable. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks show that McML can significantly improve the original multi-column networks and outperform the other state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 26.Inverse Visual Question Answering with Multi-Level Attentions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07583.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a novel deep multi-level attention model to address inverse visual question answering. The proposed model generates regional visual and semantic features at the object level and then enhances them with the answer cue by using attention mechanisms. Two levels of multiple attentions are employed in the model, including the dual attention at the partial question encoding step and the dynamic attention at the next question word generation step. We evaluate the proposed model on the VQA V1 dataset. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in terms of multiple commonly used metrics. 
### 27.Object-Centric Stereo Matching for 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07566.pdf)
>  Safe autonomous driving requires reliable 3D object detection-determining the 6 DoF pose and dimensions of objects of interest. Using stereo cameras to solve this task is a cost-effective alternative to the widely used LiDAR sensor. The current state-of-the-art for stereo 3D object detection takes the existing PSMNet stereo matching network, with no modifications, and converts the estimated disparities into a 3D point cloud, and feeds this point cloud into a LiDAR-based 3D object detector. The issue with existing stereo matching networks is that they are designed for disparity estimation, not 3D object detection; the shape and accuracy of object point clouds are not the focus. Stereo matching networks commonly suffer from inaccurate depth estimates at object boundaries, which we define as streaking, because background and foreground points are jointly estimated. Existing networks also penalize disparity instead of the estimated position of object point clouds in their loss functions. We propose a novel 2D box association and object-centric stereo matching method that only estimates the disparities of the objects of interest to address these two issues. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI 3D and BEV benchmarks. 
### 28.HAD-GAN: A Human-perception Auxiliary Defense GAN model to Defend Adversarial Examples  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07558.pdf)
>  Adversarial examples reveal the vulnerability and unexplained nature of neural networks. It is of great practical significance to study the defense of adversarial examples. In fact, most adversarial examples that misclassify networks are often undetectable by humans. In this paper, we propose a defense model to train the classifier into a human-perception classification model with shape preference. The proposed model consisting of a TTN (Texture Transfer Network) and an auxiliary defense GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) is called HAD-GAN (Human-perception Auxiliary Defense GAN). The TTN is used to extend the texture samples of a clean image and makes classifiers more focused on its shape. And GAN is utilized to form a training framework for the model and generate the images we need. A series of experiments conducted on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10 show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art defense methods for network robust, and have a significant improvement on defense ability of adversarial examples. 
### 29.STELA: A Real-Time Scene Text Detector with Learned Anchor  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07549.pdf)
>  To achieve high coverage of target boxes, a normal strategy of conventional one-stage anchor-based detectors is to utilize multiple priors at each spatial position, especially in scene text detection tasks. In this work, we present a simple and intuitive method for multi-oriented text detection where each location of feature maps only associates with one reference box. The idea is inspired from the twostage R-CNN framework that can estimate the location of objects with any shape by using learned proposals. The aim of our method is to integrate this mechanism into a onestage detector and employ the learned anchor which is obtained through a regression operation to replace the original one into the final predictions. Based on RetinaNet, our method achieves competitive performances on several public benchmarks with a totally real-time efficiency (26:5fps at 800p), which surpasses all of anchor-based scene text detectors. In addition, with less attention on anchor design, we believe our method is easy to be applied on other analogous detection tasks.

### 30.A*3D Dataset: Towards Autonomous Driving in Challenging Environments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07541.pdf)
>  With the increasing global popularity of self-driving cars, there is an immediate need for challenging real-world datasets for benchmarking and training various computer vision tasks such as 3D object detection. Existing datasets either represent simple scenarios or provide only day-time data. In this paper, we introduce a new challenging A*3D dataset which consists of RGB images and LiDAR data with significant diversity of scene, time, and weather. The dataset consists of high-density images ($\approx~10$ times more than the pioneering KITTI dataset), heavy occlusions, a large number of night-time frames ($\approx~3$ times the nuScenes dataset), addressing the gaps in the existing datasets to push the boundaries of tasks in autonomous driving research to more challenging highly diverse environments. The dataset contains $39\text{K}$ frames, $7$ classes, and $230\text{K}$ 3D object annotations. An extensive 3D object detection benchmark evaluation on the A*3D dataset for various attributes such as high density, day-time/night-time, gives interesting insights into the advantages and limitations of training and testing 3D object detection in real-world setting. 
### 31.Data-Efficient Classification of Birdcall Through Convolutional Neural Networks Transfer Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07526.pdf)
>  Deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are powerful classification models but require a large amount of training data. In niche domains such as bird acoustics, it is expensive and difficult to obtain a large number of training samples. One method of classifying data with a limited number of training samples is to employ transfer learning. In this research, we evaluated the effectiveness of birdcall classification using transfer learning from a larger base dataset (2814 samples in 46 classes) to a smaller target dataset (351 samples in 10 classes) using the ResNet-50 CNN. We obtained 79% average validation accuracy on the target dataset in 5-fold cross-validation. The methodology of transfer learning from an ImageNet-trained CNN to a project-specific and a much smaller set of classes and images was extended to the domain of spectrogram images, where the base dataset effectively played the role of the ImageNet. 
### 32.Scene Compliant Trajectory Forecast with Agent-Centric Spatio-Temporal Grids  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07507.pdf)
>  Forecasting long-term human motion is a challenging task due to the non-linearity, multi-modality and inherent uncertainty in future trajectories. The underlying scene and past motion of agents can provide useful cues to predict their future motion. However, the heterogeneity of the two inputs poses a challenge for learning a joint representation of the scene and past trajectories. To address this challenge, we propose a model based on grid representations to forecast agent trajectories. We represent the past trajectories of agents using binary 2-D grids, and the underlying scene as a RGB birds-eye view (BEV) image, with an agent-centric frame of reference. We encode the scene and past trajectories using convolutional layers and generate trajectory forecasts using a Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) decoder. Results on the publicly available Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) show that our model outperforms prior approaches and outputs realistic future trajectories that comply with scene structure and past motion. 
### 33.Learning Geo-Temporal Image Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07499.pdf)
>  We propose to implicitly learn to extract geo-temporal image features, which are mid-level features related to when and where an image was captured, by explicitly optimizing for a set of location and time estimation tasks. To train our method, we take advantage of a large image dataset, captured by outdoor webcams and cell phones. The only form of supervision we provide are the known capture time and location of each image. We find that our approach learns features that are related to natural appearance changes in outdoor scenes. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of these geo-temporal features to time and location estimation. 
### 34.Constructing Dynamic Knowledge Graph for Visual Semantic Understanding and Applications in Autonomous Robotics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07459.pdf)
>  Interpreting semantic knowledge describing entities, relations and attributes explicitly with visuals and implicitly with in behind-scene common senses gain more attention in autonomous robotics. By incorporating vision and language modeling with common-sense knowledge, we can provide rich features indicating strong semantic meanings for human and robot action relationships, which can be utilized further in autonomous robotic controls. In this paper, we propose a systematic scheme to generate high-conceptual dynamic knowledge graphs representing Entity-Relation-Entity (E-R-E) and Entity-Attribute-Value (E-A-V) knowledges by "watching" a video clip. A combination of Vision-Language model and static ontology tree is used to illustrate workspace, configurations, functions and usages for both human and robot. The proposed method is flexible and well-versed. It will serve as our first positioning investigation for further research in various applications for autonomous robots. 
### 35.Reproducibility of an airway tapering measurement in CT with application to bronchiectasis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07454.pdf)
>  Purpose: This paper proposes a pipeline to acquire a scalar tapering measurement from the carina to the most distal point of an individual airway visible on CT. We show the applicability of using tapering measurements on clinically acquired data by quantifying the reproducibility of the tapering measure. Methods: We generate a spline from the centreline of an airway to measure the area and arclength at contiguous intervals. The tapering measurement is the gradient of the linear regression between area in log space and arclength. The reproducibility of the measure was assessed by analysing different radiation doses, voxel sizes and reconstruction kernel on single timepoint and longitudinal CT scans and by evaluating the effct of airway bifurcations. Results: Using 74 airways from 10 CT scans, we show a statistical difference, p = 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ in tapering between healthy airways (n = 35) and those affected by bronchiectasis (n = 39). The difference between the mean of the two populations was 0.011mm$^{-1}$ and the difference between the medians of the two populations was 0.006mm$^{-1}$. The tapering measurement retained a 95\% confidence interval of $\pm$0.005mm$^{-1}$ in a simulated 25 mAs scan and retained a 95% confidence of $\pm$0.005mm$^{-1}$ on simulated CTs up to 1.5 times the original voxel size. Conclusion: We have established an estimate of the precision of the tapering measurement and estimated the effect on precision of simulated voxel size and CT scan dose. We recommend that the scanner calibration be undertaken with the phantoms as described, on the specific CT scanner, radiation dose and reconstruction algorithm that is to be used in any quantitative studies.

### 36.Semantic Relatedness Based Re-ranker for Text Spotting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07950.pdf)
>  Applications such as textual entailment, plagiarism detection or document clustering rely on the notion of semantic similarity, and are usually approached with dimension reduction techniques like LDA or with embedding-based neural approaches. We present a scenario where semantic similarity is not enough, and we devise a neural approach to learn semantic relatedness. The scenario is text spotting in the wild, where a text in an image (e.g. street sign, advertisement or bus destination) must be identified and recognized. Our goal is to improve the performance of vision systems by leveraging semantic information. Our rationale is that the text to be spotted is often related to the image context in which it appears (word pairs such as Delta-airplane, or quarters-parking are not similar, but are clearly related). We show how learning a word-to-word or word-to-sentence relatedness score can improve the performance of text spotting systems up to 2.9 points, outperforming other measures in a benchmark dataset. 
### 37.Ludwig: a type-based declarative deep learning toolbox  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07930.pdf)
>  In this work we present Ludwig, a flexible, extensible and easy to use toolbox which allows users to train deep learning models and use them for obtaining predictions without writing code. Ludwig implements a novel approach to deep learning model building based on two main abstractions: data types and declarative configuration files. The data type abstraction allows for easier code and sub-model reuse, and the standardized interfaces imposed by this abstraction allow for encapsulation and make the code easy to extend. Declarative model definition configuration files enable inexperienced users to obtain effective models and increase the productivity of expert users. Alongside these two innovations, Ludwig introduces a general modularized deep learning architecture called Encoder-Combiner-Decoder that can be instantiated to perform a vast amount of machine learning tasks. These innovations make it possible for engineers, scientists from other fields and, in general, a much broader audience to adopt deep learning models for their tasks, concretely helping in its democratization. 
### 38.TruPercept: Trust Modelling for Autonomous Vehicle Cooperative Perception from Synthetic Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07867.pdf)
>  Inter-vehicle communication for autonomous vehicles (AVs) stands to provide significant benefits in terms of perception robustness. We propose a novel approach for AVs to communicate perceptual observations, tempered by trust modelling of peers providing reports. Based on the accuracy of reported object detections as verified locally, communicated messages can be fused to augment perception performance beyond line of sight and at great distance from the ego vehicle. Also presented is a new synthetic dataset which can be used to test cooperative perception. The TruPercept dataset includes unreliable and malicious behaviour scenarios to experiment with some challenges cooperative perception introduces. The TruPercept runtime and evaluation framework allows modular component replacement to facilitate ablation studies as well as the creation of new trust scenarios we are able to show. 
### 39.Character-Centric Storytelling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07863.pdf)
>  Sequential vision-to-language or visual storytelling has recently been one of the areas of focus in computer vision and language modeling domains. Though existing models generate narratives that read subjectively well, there could be cases when these models miss out on generating stories that account and address all prospective human and animal characters in the image sequences. Considering this scenario, we propose a model that implicitly learns relationships between provided characters and thereby generates stories with respective characters in scope. We use the VIST dataset for this purpose and report numerous statistics on the dataset. Eventually, we describe the model, explain the experiment and discuss our current status and future work. 
### 40.Rethinking Deep Neural Network Ownership Verification: Embedding Passports to Defeat Ambiguity Attacks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07830.pdf)
>  With the rapid development of deep neural networks (DNN), there emerges an urgent need to protect the trained DNN models from being illegally copied, redistributed, or abused without respecting the intellectual properties of legitimate owners. Following recent progresses along this line, we investigate a number of watermark-based DNN ownership verification methods in the face of ambiguity attacks, which aim to cast doubts on ownership verification by forging counterfeit watermarks. It is shown that ambiguity attacks pose serious challenges to existing DNN watermarking methods. As remedies to the above-mentioned loophole, this paper proposes novel passport-based DNN ownership verification schemes which are both robust to network modifications and resilient to ambiguity attacks. The gist of embedding digital passports is to design and train DNN models in a way such that, the DNN model performance of an original task will be significantly deteriorated due to forged passports. In other words genuine passports are not only verified by looking for predefined signatures, but also reasserted by the unyielding DNN model performances. Extensive experimental results justify the effectiveness of the proposed passport-based DNN ownership verification schemes.

### 41.Single-shot 3D shape reconstruction using deep convolutional neural networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07766.pdf)
>  A robust single-shot 3D shape reconstruction technique integrating the fringe projection profilometry (FPP) technique with the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed in this letter. The input of the proposed technique is a single FPP image, and the training and validation data sets are prepared by using the conventional multi-frequency FPP technique. Unlike the conventional 3D shape reconstruction methods which involve complex algorithms and intensive computation, the proposed approach uses an end-to-end network architecture to directly carry out the transformation of a 2D images to its corresponding 3D shape. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the validity and robustness of the proposed technique. It is capable of satisfying various 3D shape reconstruction demands in scientific research and engineering applications. 
### 42.Adversarial Feature Training for Generalizable Robotic Visuomotor Control  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07745.pdf)
>  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled training action-selection policies, end-to-end, by learning a function which maps image pixels to action outputs. However, it's application to visuomotor robotic policy training has been limited because of the challenge of large-scale data collection when working with physical hardware. A suitable visuomotor policy should perform well not just for the task-setup it has been trained for, but also for all varieties of the task, including novel objects at different viewpoints surrounded by task-irrelevant objects. However, it is impractical for a robotic setup to sufficiently collect interactive samples in a RL framework to generalize well to novel aspects of a task. In this work, we demonstrate that by using adversarial training for domain transfer, it is possible to train visuomotor policies based on RL frameworks, and then transfer the acquired policy to other novel task domains. We propose to leverage the deep RL capabilities to learn complex visuomotor skills for uncomplicated task setups, and then exploit transfer learning to generalize to new task domains provided only still images of the task in the target domain. We evaluate our method on two real robotic tasks, picking and pouring, and compare it to a number of prior works, demonstrating its superiority. 
### 43.Multi-Task Learning for Automotive Foggy Scene Understanding via Domain Adaptation to an Illumination-Invariant Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07697.pdf)
>  Joint scene understanding and segmentation for automotive applications is a challenging problem in two key aspects:- (1) classifying every pixel in the entire scene and (2) performing this task under unstable weather and illumination changes (e.g. foggy weather), which results in poor outdoor scene visibility. This poor outdoor scene visibility leads to a non-optimal performance of deep convolutional neural network-based scene understanding and segmentation. In this paper, we propose an efficient end-to-end contemporary automotive semantic scene understanding approach under foggy weather conditions, employing domain adaptation and illumination-invariant image per-transformation. As a multi-task pipeline, our proposed model provides:- (1) transferring images from extreme to clear-weather condition using domain transfer approach and (2) semantically segmenting a scene using a competitive encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) with dense connectivity, skip connections and fusion-based techniques. We evaluate our approach on challenging foggy datasets, including synthetic dataset (Foggy Cityscapes) as well as real-world datasets (Foggy Zurich and Foggy Driving). By incorporating RGB, depth, and illumination-invariant information, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art within automotive scene understanding, under foggy weather condition. 
### 44.A Convergence Proof of Projected Fast Iterative Soft-thresholding Algorithm for Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07600.pdf)
>  The boom of non-uniform sampling and compressed sensing techniques dramatically alleviates the prolonged data acquisition problem of magnetic resonance imaging. Sparse reconstruction, thanks to its fast computation and promising performance, has attracted researchers to put numerous efforts on it and has been adopted in commercial scanners. Algorithms for solving the sparse reconstruction models play an essential role in sparse reconstruction. Being a simple and efficient algorithm for sparse reconstruction, pFISTA has been successfully extended to parallel imaging, however, its convergence criterion is still an open question, confusing users on the setting of the parameter which assures the convergence of the algorithm. In this work, we prove the convergence of the parallel imaging version pFISTA. Specifically, the convergences of two well-known parallel imaging reconstruction models, SENSE and SPIRiT, solved by pFISTA are proved. Experiments on brain images demonstrate the validity of the convergence criterion. The convergence criterion proofed in this work can help users quickly obtain the satisfy parameter that admits faithful results and fast convergence speeds. 
### 45.Conformal Prediction based Spectral Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07594.pdf)
>  Spectral Clustering(SC) is a prominent data clustering technique of recent times which has attracted much attention from researchers. It is a highly data-driven method and makes no strict assumptions on the structure of the data to be clustered. One of the central pieces of spectral clustering is the construction of an affinity matrix based on a similarity measure between data points. The way the similarity measure is defined between data points has a direct impact on the performance of the SC technique. Several attempts have been made in the direction of strengthening the pairwise similarity measure to enhance the spectral clustering. In this work, we have defined a novel affinity measure by employing the concept of non-conformity used in Conformal Prediction(CP) framework. The non-conformity based affinity captures the relationship between neighborhoods of data points and has the power to generalize the notion of contextual similarity. We have shown that this formulation of affinity measure gives good results and compares well with the state of the art methods. 
### 46.Radiopathomics: Integration of radiographic and histologic characteristics for prognostication in glioblastoma  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07581.pdf)
>  Both radiographic (Rad) imaging, such as multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging, and digital pathology (Path) images captured from tissue samples are currently acquired as standard clinical practice for glioblastoma tumors. Both these data streams have been separately used for diagnosis and treatment planning, despite the fact that they provide complementary information. In this research work, we aimed to assess the potential of both Rad and Path images in combination and comparison. An extensive set of engineered features was extracted from delineated tumor regions in Rad images, comprising T1, T1-Gd, T2, T2-FLAIR, and 100 random patches extracted from Path images. Specifically, the features comprised descriptors of intensity, histogram, and texture, mainly quantified via gray-level-co-occurrence matrix and gray-level-run-length matrices. Features extracted from images of 107 glioblastoma patients, downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive, were run through support vector machine for classification using leave-one-out cross-validation mechanism, and through support vector regression for prediction of continuous survival outcome. The Pearson correlation coefficient was estimated to be 0.75, 0.74, and 0.78 for Rad, Path and RadPath data. The area-under the receiver operating characteristic curve was estimated to be 0.74, 0.76 and 0.80 for Rad, Path and RadPath data, when patients were discretized into long- and short-survival groups based on average survival cutoff. Our results support the notion that synergistically using Rad and Path images may lead to better prognosis at the initial presentation of the disease, thereby facilitating the targeted enrollment of patients into clinical trials. 
### 47.Multi-FAN: Multi-Spectral Mosaic Super-Resolution Via Multi-Scale Feature Aggregation Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07577.pdf)
>  This paper introduces a novel method to super-resolve multi-spectral images captured by modern real-time single-shot mosaic image sensors, also known as multi-spectral cameras. Our contribution is two-fold. Firstly, we super-resolve multi-spectral images from mosaic images rather than image cubes, which helps to take into account the spatial offset of each wavelength. Secondly, we introduce an external multi-scale feature aggregation network (Multi-FAN) which concatenates the feature maps with different levels of semantic information throughout a super-resolution (SR) network. A cascade of convolutional layers then implicitly selects the most valuable feature maps to generate a mosaic image. This mosaic image is then merged with the mosaic image generated by the SR network to produce a quantitatively superior image. We apply our Multi-FAN to RCAN (Residual Channel Attention Network), which is the state-of-the-art SR algorithm. We show that Multi-FAN improves both quantitative results and well as inference time. 
### 48.Is That a Chair? Imagining Affordances Using Simulations of an Articulated Human Body  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07572.pdf)
>  For robots to exhibit a high level of intelligence in the real world, they must be able to assess objects for which they have no prior knowledge. Therefore, it is crucial for robots to perceive object affordances by reasoning about physical interactions with the object. In this paper, we propose a novel method to provide robots with an imagination of object affordances using physical simulations. The class of chair is chosen here as an initial category of objects to illustrate a more general paradigm. In our method, the robot "imagines" the affordance of an arbitrarily oriented object as a chair by simulating a physical "sitting" interaction between an articulated human body and the object. This object affordance reasoning is used as a cue for object classification (chair vs non-chair). Moreover, if an object is classified as a chair, the affordance reasoning can also predict the upright pose of the object which allows the sitting interaction to take place. We call this type of poses the functional pose. We demonstrate our method in chair classification on synthetic 3D CAD models. Although our method uses only 20 models for training, it outperforms appearance-based deep learning methods, which require a large amount of training data, when the upright orientation is not assumed to be known as a priori. In addition, we showcase that the functional pose predictions of our method on both synthetic models and real objects scanned by a depth camera align well with human judgments. 
### 49.Real-Time Variational Fisheye Stereo without Rectification and Undistortion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07545.pdf)
>  Dense 3D maps from wide-angle cameras is beneficial to robotics applications such as navigation and autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a real-time dense 3D mapping method for fisheye cameras without explicit rectification and undistortion. We extend the conventional variational stereo method by constraining the correspondence search along the epipolar curve using a trajectory field induced by camera motion. We also propose a fast way of generating the trajectory field without increasing the processing time compared to conventional rectified methods. With our implementation, we were able to achieve real-time processing using modern GPUs. Our results show the advantages of our non-rectified dense mapping approach compared to rectified variational methods and non-rectified discrete stereo matching methods. 
### 50.They Might NOT Be Giants: Crafting Black-Box Adversarial Examples with Fewer Queries Using Particle Swarm Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07490.pdf)
>  Machine learning models have been found to be susceptible to adversarial examples that are often indistinguishable from the original inputs. These adversarial examples are created by applying adversarial perturbations to input samples, which would cause them to be misclassified by the target models. Attacks that search and apply the perturbations to create adversarial examples are performed in both white-box and black-box settings, depending on the information available to the attacker about the target. For black-box attacks, the only capability available to the attacker is the ability to query the target with specially crafted inputs and observing the labels returned by the model. Current black-box attacks either have low success rates, requires a high number of queries, or produce adversarial examples that are easily distinguishable from their sources. In this paper, we present AdversarialPSO, a black-box attack that uses fewer queries to create adversarial examples with high success rates. AdversarialPSO is based on the evolutionary search algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization, a populationbased gradient-free optimization algorithm. It is flexible in balancing the number of queries submitted to the target vs the quality of imperceptible adversarial examples. The attack has been evaluated using the image classification benchmark datasets CIFAR-10, MNIST, and Imagenet, achieving success rates of 99.6%, 96.3%, and 82.0%, respectively, while submitting substantially fewer queries than the state-of-the-art. We also present a black-box method for isolating salient features used by models when making classifications. This method, called Swarms with Individual Search Spaces or SWISS, creates adversarial examples by finding and modifying the most important features in the input. 
### 51.Z-Net: an Asymmetric 3D DCNN for Medical CT Volume Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07480.pdf)
>  Accurate volume segmentation from the Computed Tomography (CT) scan is a common prerequisite for pre-operative planning, intra-operative guidance and quantitative assessment of therapeutic outcomes in robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). The use of 3D Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is a viable solution for this task but is memory intensive. The use of patch division can mitigate this issue in practice, but can cause discontinuities between the adjacent patches and severe class-imbalances within individual sub-volumes. This paper presents a new patch division approach - Patch-512 to tackle the class-imbalance issue by preserving a full field-of-view of the objects in the XY planes. To achieve better segmentation results based on these asymmetric patches, a 3D DCNN architecture using asymmetrical separable convolutions is proposed. The proposed network, called Z-Net, can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D DCNNs such as 3D U-Net and V-Net, for improved volume segmentation. Detailed validation of the method is provided for CT aortic, liver and lung segmentation, demonstrating the effectiveness and practical value of the method for intra-operative 3D navigation in robot-assisted MIS. 
### 52.Efficient 3D Fully Convolutional Networks for Pulmonary Lobe Segmentation in CT Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07474.pdf)
>  The human lung is a complex respiratory organ, consisting of five distinct anatomic compartments called lobes. Accurate and automatic segmentation of these pulmonary lobes from computed tomography (CT) images is of clinical importance for lung disease assessment and treatment planning. However, this task is challenging due to ambiguous lobar boundaries, anatomical variations and pathological deformations. In this paper, we propose a high-resolution and efficient 3D fully convolutional network to automatically segment the lobes. We refer to the network as Pulmonary Lobe Segmentation Network (PLS-Net), which is designed to efficiently exploit 3D spatial and contextual information from high-resolution volumetric CT images for effective volume-to-volume learning and inference. The PLS-Net is based on an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with three novel components: (i) 3D depthwise separable convolutions to improve the network efficiency by factorising each regular 3D convolution into two simpler operations; (ii) dilated residual dense blocks to efficiently expand the receptive field of the network and aggregate multi-scale contextual information for segmentation; and (iii) input reinforcement at each downsampled resolution to compensate for the loss of spatial information due to convolutional and downsampling operations. We evaluated the proposed PLS-Net on a multi-institutional dataset that consists of 210 CT images acquired from patients with a wide range of lung abnormalities. Experimental results show that our PLS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with better computational efficiency. Further experiments confirm the effectiveness of each novel component of the PLS-Net. 
### 53.Regular Partitions and Their Use in Structural Pattern Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07420.pdf)
>  Recent years are characterized by an unprecedented quantity of available network data which are produced at an astonishing rate by an heterogeneous variety of interconnected sensors and devices. This high-throughput generation calls for the development of new effective methods to store, retrieve, understand and process massive network data. In this thesis, we tackle this challenge by introducing a framework to summarize large graphs based on Szemerédi's Regularity Remma (RL), which roughly states that any sufficiently large graph can almost entirely be partitioned into a bounded number of random-like bipartite graphs. The partition resulting from the RL gives rise to a summary, which inherits many of the essential structural properties of the original graph. We first extend an heuristic version of the RL to improve its efficiency and its robustness. We use the proposed algorithm to address graph-based clustering and image segmentation tasks. In the second part of the thesis, we introduce a new heuristic algorithm which is characterized by an improvement of the summary quality both in terms of reconstruction error and of noise filtering. We use the proposed heuristic to address the graph search problem defined under a similarity measure. Finally, we study the linkage among the regularity lemma, the stochastic block model and the minimum description length. This study provide us a principled way to develop a graph decomposition algorithm based on stochastic block model which is fitted using likelihood maximization.
