### 1.Local Light Field Fusion: Practical View Synthesis with Prescriptive Sampling Guidelines  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00889.pdf)
>  We present a practical and robust deep learning solution for capturing and rendering novel views of complex real world scenes for virtual exploration. Previous approaches either require intractably dense view sampling or provide little to no guidance for how users should sample views of a scene to reliably render high-quality novel views. Instead, we propose an algorithm for view synthesis from an irregular grid of sampled views that first expands each sampled view into a local light field via a multiplane image (MPI) scene representation, then renders novel views by blending adjacent local light fields. We extend traditional plenoptic sampling theory to derive a bound that specifies precisely how densely users should sample views of a given scene when using our algorithm. In practice, we apply this bound to capture and render views of real world scenes that achieve the perceptual quality of Nyquist rate view sampling while using up to 4000x fewer views. We demonstrate our approach's practicality with an augmented reality smartphone app that guides users to capture input images of a scene and viewers that enable realtime virtual exploration on desktop and mobile platforms. 
### 2.Self-supervised Learning for Video Correspondence Flow  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00875.pdf)
>  The objective of this paper is self-supervised learning of feature embeddings from videos, suitable for correspondence flow, i.e. matching correspondences between frames over the video. We leverage the natural spatial-temporal coherence of appearance in videos, to create a "pointer" model that learns to reconstruct a target frame by copying colors from a reference frame. <br>We make three contributions: First, we introduce a simple information bottleneck that enforces the model to learn robust features for correspondence matching, and avoids it learning trivial solutions, e.g. matching based on low-level color information. Second, we propose to train the model over a long temporal window in videos. To make the model more robust to complex object deformation, occlusion, i.e. the problem of tracker drifting, we formulate a recursive model, trained with scheduled sampling and cycle consistency. Third, we evaluate the approach by first training on the Kinetics dataset using self-supervised learning, and then directly applied for DAVIS video segmentation and JHMDB keypoint tracking. On both tasks, our approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially on segmentation, we outperform all previous methods by a significant margin. 
### 3.Lifting Vectorial Variational Problems: A Natural Formulation based on Geometric Measure Theory and Discrete Exterior Calculus  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00851.pdf)
>  Numerous tasks in imaging and vision can be formulated as variational problems over vector-valued maps. We approach the relaxation and convexification of such vectorial variational problems via a lifting to the space of currents. To that end, we recall that functionals with polyconvex Lagrangians can be reparametrized as convex one-homogeneous functionals on the graph of the function. This leads to an equivalent shape optimization problem over oriented surfaces in the product space of domain and codomain. A convex formulation is then obtained by relaxing the search space from oriented surfaces to more general currents. We propose a discretization of the resulting infinite-dimensional optimization problem using Whitney forms, which also generalizes recent "sublabel-accurate" multilabeling approaches. 
### 4.Clustering Images by Unmasking - A New Baseline  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00773.pdf)
>  We propose a novel agglomerative clustering method based on unmasking, a technique that was previously used for authorship verification of text documents and for abnormal event detection in videos. In order to join two clusters, we alternate between (i) training a binary classifier to distinguish between the samples from one cluster and the samples from the other cluster, and (ii) removing at each step the most discriminant features. The faster-decreasing accuracy rates of the intermediately-obtained classifiers indicate that the two clusters should be joined. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply unmasking in order to cluster images. We compare our method with k-means as well as a recent state-of-the-art clustering method. The empirical results indicate that our approach is able to improve performance for various (deep and shallow) feature representations and different tasks, such as handwritten digit recognition, texture classification and fine-grained object recognition. 
### 5.Human Action Recognition with Deep Temporal Pyramids  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00745.pdf)
>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are nowadays achieving significant leaps in different pattern recognition tasks including action recognition. Current CNNs are increasingly deeper, data-hungrier and this makes their success tributary of the abundance of labeled training data. CNNs also rely on max/average pooling which reduces dimensionality of output layers and hence attenuates their sensitivity to the availability of labeled data. However, this process may dilute the information of upstream convolutional layers and thereby affect the discrimination power of the trained representations, especially when the learned categories are fine-grained. <br>In this paper, we introduce a novel hierarchical aggregation design, for final pooling, that controls granularity of the learned representations w.r.t the actual granularity of action categories. Our solution is based on a tree-structured temporal pyramid that aggregates outputs of CNNs at different levels. Top levels of this hierarchy are dedicated to coarse categories while deep levels are more suitable to fine-grained ones. The design of our temporal pyramid is based on solving a constrained minimization problem whose solution corresponds to the distribution of weights of different representations in the temporal pyramid. Experiments conducted using the challenging UCF101 database show the relevance of our hierarchical design w.r.t other related methods. 
### 6.Egocentric Hand Track and Object-based Human Action Recognition  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00742.pdf)
>  Egocentric vision is an emerging field of computer vision that is characterized by the acquisition of images and video from the first person perspective. In this paper we address the challenge of egocentric human action recognition by utilizing the presence and position of detected regions of interest in the scene explicitly, without further use of visual features. <br>Initially, we recognize that human hands are essential in the execution of actions and focus on obtaining their movements as the principal cues that define actions. We employ object detection and region tracking techniques to locate hands and capture their movements. Prior knowledge about egocentric views facilitates hand identification between left and right. With regard to detection and tracking, we contribute a pipeline that successfully operates on unseen egocentric videos to find the camera wearer's hands and associate them through time. Moreover, we emphasize on the value of scene information for action recognition. We acknowledge that the presence of objects is significant for the execution of actions by humans and in general for the description of a scene. To acquire this information, we utilize object detection for specific classes that are relevant to the actions we want to recognize. <br>Our experiments are targeted on videos of kitchen activities from the Epic-Kitchens dataset. We model action recognition as a sequence learning problem of the detected spatial positions in the frames. Our results show that explicit hand and object detections with no other visual information can be relied upon to classify hand-related human actions. Testing against methods fully dependent on visual features, signals that for actions where hand motions are conceptually important, a region-of-interest-based description of a video contains equally expressive information with comparable classification performance. 
### 7.The 2019 DAVIS Challenge on VOS: Unsupervised Multi-Object Segmentation  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00737.pdf)
>  We present the 2019 DAVIS Challenge on Video Object Segmentation, the third edition of the DAVIS Challenge series, a public competition designed for the task of Video Object Segmentation (VOS). In addition to the original semi-supervised track and the interactive track introduced in the previous edition, a new unsupervised multi-object track will be featured this year. In the newly introduced track, participants are asked to provide non-overlapping object proposals on each image, along with an identifier linking them between frames (i.e. video object proposals), without any test-time human supervision (no scribbles or masks provided on the test video). In order to do so, we have re-annotated the train and val sets of DAVIS 2017 in a concise way that facilitates the unsupervised track, and created new test-dev and test-challenge sets for the competition. Definitions, rules, and evaluation metrics for the unsupervised track are described in detail in this paper. 
### 8.Face Identification using Local Ternary Tree Pattern based Spatial Structural Components  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00693.pdf)
>  This paper reports groundbreaking results of a face identification system which makes use of a novel local descriptor called Local Ternary Tree Pattern. Devising deft and feasible local descriptors for a face image plays an emergent preface in face identification task when the system performs in presence of lots of variety of face images including constrained, unconstrained and plastic surgery images. The LTTP has been proposed to extract robust and discriminatory spatial features from a face image as this descriptor can be used to best describe the various structural components of a face. To extract the most useful features, a ternary tree is formed for each pixel with its eight neighbors. LTTP pattern can be generated in four ways: LTTP Left Depth, LTTP Left Breadth, LTTP Right Depth and LTTP Right Breadth. The encoding schemes of these four patterns generation are very simple and efficient in terms of computational complexity as well as time complexity. The proposed face identification system is tested on six face databases, namely, the UMIST, the JAFFE, the extended Yale face B, the Plastic Surgery, the LFW and the UFI. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the most outstanding results which will have long term impact in designing face identification systems considering a variety of faces captured under different environments. 
### 9.DS-VIO: Robust and Efficient Stereo Visual Inertial Odometry based on Dual Stage EKF  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00684.pdf)
>  This paper presents a dual stage EKF (Extended Kalman Filter)-based algorithm for the real-time and robust stereo VIO (visual inertial odometry). The first stage of this EKF-based algorithm performs the fusion of accelerometer and gyroscope while the second performs the fusion of stereo camera and IMU. Due to the sufficient complementary characteristics between accelerometer and gyroscope as well as stereo camera and IMU, the dual stage EKF-based algorithm can achieve a high precision of odometry estimations. At the same time, because of the low dimension of state vector in this algorithm, its computational efficiency is comparable to previous filter-based approaches. We call our approach DS-VIO (dual stage EKFbased stereo visual inertial odometry) and evaluate our DSVIO algorithm by comparing it with the state-of-art approaches including OKVIS, ROVIO, VINS-MONO and S-MSCKF on the EuRoC dataset. Results show that our algorithm can achieve comparable or even better performances in terms of the RMS error 
### 10.RetinaFace: Single-stage Dense Face Localisation in the Wild  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00641.pdf)
>  Though tremendous strides have been made in uncontrolled face detection, accurate and efficient face localisation in the wild remains an open challenge. This paper presents a robust single-stage face detector, named RetinaFace, which performs pixel-wise face localisation on various scales of faces by taking advantages of joint extra-supervised and self-supervised multi-task learning. Specifically, We make contributions in the following five aspects: (1) We manually annotate five facial landmarks on the WIDER FACE dataset and observe significant improvement in hard face detection with the assistance of this extra supervision signal. (2) We further add a self-supervised mesh decoder branch for predicting a pixel-wise 3D shape face information in parallel with the existing supervised branches. (3) On the WIDER FACE hard test set, RetinaFace outperforms the state of the art average precision (AP) by $1.1\%$ (achieving AP equal to {\bf $91.4\%$}). (4) On the IJB-C test set, RetinaFace enables state of the art methods (ArcFace) to improve their results in face verification (TAR=$89.59\%$ for FAR=1e-6). (5) By employing light-weight backbone networks, RetinaFace can run real-time on a single CPU core for a VGA-resolution image. Extra annotations and code will be released to facilitate future research. 
### 11.LivDet in Action - Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition 2019  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00639.pdf)
>  The International Fingerprint liveness Detection Competition (LivDet) is an open and well-acknowledged meeting point of academies and private companies that deal with the problem of distinguishing images coming from reproductions of fingerprints made of artificial materials and images relative to real fingerprints. In this edition of LivDet we invited the competitors to propose integrated algorithms with matching systems. The goal was to investigate at which extent this integration impact on the whole performance. Twelve algorithms were submitted to the competition, eight of which worked on integrated systems. 
### 12.Directing DNNs Attention for Facial Attribution Classification using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00593.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have a high accuracy on image classification tasks. However, DNNs trained by such dataset with co-occurrence bias may rely on wrong features while making decisions for classification. It will greatly affect the transferability of pre-trained DNNs. In this paper, we propose an interactive method to direct classifiers paying attentions to the regions that are manually specified by the users, in order to mitigate the influence of co-occurrence bias. We test on CelebA dataset, the pre-trained AlexNet is fine-tuned to focus on the specific facial attributes based on the results of Grad-CAM. 
### 13.Recurrent-Convolution Approach to DeepFake Detection - State-Of-Art Results on FaceForensics++  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00582.pdf)
>  Spread of misinformation has become a significant problem, raising the importance of relevant detection methods. While there are different manifestations of misinformation, in this work we focus on detecting face manipulations in videos. Specifically, we attempt to detect Deepfake, Face2Face and FaceSwap manipulations in videos. We exploit the temporal dynamics of videos with a recurrent approach. Evaluation is done on FaceForensics++ dataset and our method improves upon the previous state-of-the-art up to 4.55%. 
### 14.Large-scale weakly-supervised pre-training for video action recognition  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00561.pdf)
>  Current fully-supervised video datasets consist of only a few hundred thousand videos and fewer than a thousand domain-specific labels. This hinders the progress towards advanced video architectures. This paper presents an in-depth study of using large volumes of web videos for pre-training video models for the task of action recognition. Our primary empirical finding is that pre-training at a very large scale (over 65 million videos), despite on noisy social-media videos and hashtags, substantially improves the state-of-the-art on three challenging public action recognition datasets. Further, we examine three questions in the construction of weakly-supervised video action datasets. First, given that actions involve interactions with objects, how should one construct a verb-object pre-training label space to benefit transfer learning the most? Second, frame-based models perform quite well on action recognition; is pre-training for good image features sufficient or is pre-training for spatio-temporal features valuable for optimal transfer learning? Finally, actions are generally less well-localized in long videos vs. short videos; since action labels are provided at a video level, how should one choose video clips for best performance, given some fixed budget of number or minutes of videos? 
### 15.Billion-scale semi-supervised learning for image classification  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00546.pdf)
>  This paper presents a study of semi-supervised learning with large convolutional networks. We propose a pipeline, based on a teacher/student paradigm, that leverages a large collection of unlabelled images (up to 1 billion). Our main goal is to improve the performance for a given target architecture, like ResNet-50 or ResNext. We provide an extensive analysis of the success factors of our approach, which leads us to formulate some recommendations to produce high-accuracy models for image classification with semi-supervised learning. As a result, our approach brings important gains to standard architectures for image, video and fine-grained classification. For instance, by leveraging one billion unlabelled images, our learned vanilla ResNet-50 achieves 81.2% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark. 
### 16.DPSNet: End-to-end Deep Plane Sweep Stereo  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00538.pdf)
>  Multiview stereo aims to reconstruct scene depth from images acquired by a camera under arbitrary motion. Recent methods address this problem through deep learning, which can utilize semantic cues to deal with challenges such as textureless and reflective regions. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network called DPSNet (Deep Plane Sweep Network) whose design is inspired by best practices of traditional geometry-based approaches for dense depth reconstruction. Rather than directly estimating depth and/or optical flow correspondence from image pairs as done in many previous deep learning methods, DPSNet takes a plane sweep approach that involves building a cost volume from deep features using the plane sweep algorithm, regularizing the cost volume via a context-aware cost aggregation, and regressing the dense depth map from the cost volume. The cost volume is constructed using a differentiable warping process that allows for end-to-end training of the network. Through the effective incorporation of conventional multiview stereo concepts within a deep learning framework, DPSNet achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction results on a variety of challenging datasets. 
### 17.RRPN: Radar Region Proposal Network for Object Detection in Autonomous Vehicles  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00526.pdf)
>  Region proposal algorithms play an important role in most state-of-the-art two-stage object detection networks by hypothesizing object locations in each image. Nonetheless, region proposal generators are known to be the bottleneck in these two-stage object detection networks, making them slow and not suitable for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles. In this paper we introduce a Radar-based real-time region proposal algorithm for object detection in autonomous vehicles. The proposed Regions of Interest (RoI) are generated by mapping Radar detections to the image coordinate system and generating pre-defined anchor boxes as object proposals at each mapped Radar point. We then perform transformation and scaling operations on the generated anchors based on objects' distance to provide better fit for the detected objects. We evaluate our method on the newly released NuScenes dataset using the Fast R-CNN object detection network. Compared to the Selective Search object proposal algorithm, our model operates more than 100x faster while at the same time achieves higher detection precision and recall.

### 18.3D BAT: A Semi-Automatic, Web-based 3D Annotation Toolbox for Full-Surround, Multi-Modal Data Streams  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00525.pdf)
>  In this paper, we focus on obtaining 2D and 3D labels, as well as track IDs for objects on the road with the help of a novel 3D Bounding Box Annotation Toolbox (3D BAT). Our open source, web-based 3D BAT incorporates several smart features to improve usability and efficiency. For instance, this annotation toolbox supports semi-automatic labeling of tracks using interpolation, which is vital for downstream tasks like tracking, motion planning and motion prediction. Moreover, annotations for all camera images are automatically obtained by projecting annotations from 3D space into the image domain. In addition to the raw image and point cloud feeds, a Masterview consisting of the top view (bird's-eye-view), side view and front views is made available to observe objects of interest from different perspectives. Comparisons of our method with other publicly available annotation tools reveal that 3D annotations can be obtained faster and more efficiently by using our toolbox. 
### 19.Optimal Multi-view Correction of Local Affine Frames  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00519.pdf)
>  The technique requires the epipolar geometry to be pre-estimated between each image pair. It exploits the constraints which the camera movement implies, in order to apply a closed-form correction to the parameters of the input affinities. Also, it is shown that the rotations and scales obtained by partially affine-covariant detectors, e.g., AKAZE or SIFT, can be completed to be full affine frames by the proposed algorithm. It is validated both in synthetic experiments and on publicly available real-world datasets that the method always improves the output of the evaluated affine-covariant feature detectors. As a by-product, these detectors are compared and the ones obtaining the most accurate affine frames are reported. For demonstrating the applicability, we show that the proposed technique as a pre-processing step improves the accuracy of pose estimation for a camera rig, surface normal and homography estimation. 
### 20.Detection of Single Grapevine Berries in Images Using Fully Convolutional Neural Networks  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00458.pdf)
>  Yield estimation and forecasting are of special interest in the field of grapevine breeding and viticulture. The number of harvested berries per plant is strongly correlated with the resulting quality. Therefore, early yield forecasting can enable a focused thinning of berries to ensure a high quality end product. Traditionally yield estimation is done by extrapolating from a small sample size and by utilizing historic data. Moreover, it needs to be carried out by skilled experts with much experience in this field. Berry detection in images offers a cheap, fast and non-invasive alternative to the otherwise time-consuming and subjective on-site analysis by experts. We apply fully convolutional neural networks on images acquired with the Phenoliner, a field phenotyping platform. We count single berries in images to avoid the error-prone detection of grapevine clusters. Clusters are often overlapping and can vary a lot in the size which makes the reliable detection of them difficult. We address especially the detection of white grapes directly in the vineyard. The detection of single berries is formulated as a classification task with three classes, namely 'berry', 'edge' and 'background'. A connected component algorithm is applied to determine the number of berries in one image. We compare the automatically counted number of berries with the manually detected berries in 60 images showing Riesling plants in vertical shoot positioned trellis (VSP) and semi minimal pruned hedges (SMPH). We are able to detect berries correctly within the VSP system with an accuracy of 94.0 \% and for the SMPH system with 85.6 \%. 
### 21.Single Image Portrait Relighting  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00824.pdf)
>  Lighting plays a central role in conveying the essence and depth of the subject in a portrait photograph. Professional photographers will carefully control the lighting in their studio to manipulate the appearance of their subject, while consumer photographers are usually constrained to the illumination of their environment. Though prior works have explored techniques for relighting an image, their utility is usually limited due to requirements of specialized hardware, multiple images of the subject under controlled or known illuminations, or accurate models of geometry and reflectance. To this end, we present a system for portrait relighting: a neural network that takes as input a single RGB image of a portrait taken with a standard cellphone camera in an unconstrained environment, and from that image produces a relit image of that subject as though it were illuminated according to any provided environment map. Our method is trained on a small database of 18 individuals captured under different directional light sources in a controlled light stage setup consisting of a densely sampled sphere of lights. Our proposed technique produces quantitatively superior results on our dataset's validation set compared to prior works, and produces convincing qualitative relighting results on a dataset of hundreds of real-world cellphone portraits. Because our technique can produce a 640 $\times$ 640 image in only 160 milliseconds, it may enable interactive user-facing photographic applications in the future. 
### 22.Toward Extremely Low Bit and Lossless Accuracy in DNNs with Progressive ADMM  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00789.pdf)
>  Weight quantization is one of the most important techniques of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) model compression method. A recent work using systematic framework of DNN weight quantization with the advanced optimization algorithm ADMM (Alternating Direction Methods of Multipliers) achieves one of state-of-art results in weight quantization. In this work, we first extend such ADMM-based framework to guarantee solution feasibility and we have further developed a multi-step, progressive DNN weight quantization framework, with dual benefits of (i) achieving further weight quantization thanks to the special property of ADMM regularization, and (ii) reducing the search space within each step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance compared with prior work. Some highlights: we derive the first lossless and fully binarized (for all layers) LeNet-5 for MNIST; And we derive the first fully binarized (for all layers) VGG-16 for CIFAR-10 and ResNet for ImageNet with reasonable accuracy loss. 
### 23.Full-Jacobian Representation of Neural Networks  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00780.pdf)
>  Non-linear functions such as neural networks can be locally approximated by affine planes. Recent works make use of input-Jacobians, which describe the normal to these planes. In this paper, we introduce full-Jacobians, which includes this normal along with an additional intercept term called the bias-Jacobians, that together completely describe local planes. For ReLU neural networks, bias-Jacobians correspond to sums of gradients of outputs w.r.t. intermediate layer activations. <br>We first use these full-Jacobians for distillation by aligning gradients of their intermediate representations. Next, we regularize bias-Jacobians alone to improve generalization. Finally, we show that full-Jacobian maps can be viewed as saliency maps. Experimental results show improved distillation on small data-sets, improved generalization for neural network training, and sharper saliency maps. 
### 24.Inverse Halftoning Through Structure-Aware Deep Convolutional Neural Networks  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00637.pdf)
>  The primary issue in inverse halftoning is removing noisy dots on flat areas and restoring image structures (e.g., lines, patterns) on textured areas. Hence, a new structure-aware deep convolutional neural network that incorporates two subnetworks is proposed in this paper. One subnetwork is for image structure prediction while the other is for continuous-tone image reconstruction. First, to predict image structures, patch pairs comprising continuous-tone patches and the corresponding halftoned patches generated through digital halftoning are trained. Subsequently, gradient patches are generated by convolving gradient filters with the continuous-tone patches. The subnetwork for the image structure prediction is trained using the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm given the halftoned patches and gradient patches, which are fed into the input and loss layers of the subnetwork, respectively. Next, the predicted map including the image structures is stacked on the top of the input halftoned image through a fusion layer and fed into the image reconstruction subnetwork such that the entire network is trained adaptively to the image structures. The experimental results confirm that the proposed structure-aware network can remove noisy dot-patterns well on flat areas and restore details clearly on textured areas. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed method surpasses the conventional state-of-the-art methods based on deep convolutional neural networks and locally learned dictionaries. 
### 25.26ms Inference Time for ResNet-50: Towards Real-Time Execution of all DNNs on Smartphone  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00571.pdf)
>  With the rapid emergence of a spectrum of high-end mobile devices, many applications that required desktop-level computation capability formerly can now run on these devices without any problem. However, without a careful optimization, executing Deep Neural Networks (a key building block of the real-time video stream processing that is the foundation of many popular applications) is still challenging, specifically, if an extremely low latency or high accuracy inference is needed. This work presents CADNN, a programming framework to efficiently execute DNN on mobile devices with the help of advanced model compression (sparsity) and a set of thorough architecture-aware optimization. The evaluation result demonstrates that CADNN outperforms all the state-of-the-art dense DNN execution frameworks like TensorFlow Lite and TVM. 
### 26.Land Use and Land Cover Classification Using Deep Learning Techniques  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00510.pdf)
>  Large datasets of sub-meter aerial imagery represented as orthophoto mosaics are widely available today, and these data sets may hold a great deal of untapped information. This imagery has a potential to locate several types of features; for example, forests, parking lots, airports, residential areas, or freeways in the imagery. However, the appearances of these things vary based on many things including the time that the image is captured, the sensor settings, processing done to rectify the image, and the geographical and cultural context of the region captured by the image. This thesis explores the use of deep convolutional neural networks to classify land use from very high spatial resolution (VHR), orthorectified, visible band multispectral imagery. Recent technological and commercial applications have driven the collection a massive amount of VHR images in the visible red, green, blue (RGB) spectral bands, this work explores the potential for deep learning algorithms to exploit this imagery for automatic land use/ land cover (LULC) classification. 
### 27.Fully Automatic Brain Tumor Segmentation using a Normalized Gaussian Bayesian Classifier and 3D Fluid Vector Flow  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00469.pdf)
>  Brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) is an important task to measure tumor responses to treatments. However, automatic segmentation is very challenging. This paper presents an automatic brain tumor segmentation method based on a Normalized Gaussian Bayesian classification and a new 3D Fluid Vector Flow (FVF) algorithm. In our method, a Normalized Gaussian Mixture Model (NGMM) is proposed and used to model the healthy brain tissues. Gaussian Bayesian Classifier is exploited to acquire a Gaussian Bayesian Brain Map (GBBM) from the test brain MR images. GBBM is further processed to initialize the 3D FVF algorithm, which segments the brain tumor. This algorithm has two major contributions. First, we present a NGMM to model healthy brains. Second, we extend our 2D FVF algorithm to 3D space and use it for brain tumor segmentation. The proposed method is validated on a publicly available dataset. 
### 28.NATTACK: Learning the Distributions of Adversarial Examples for an Improved Black-Box Attack on Deep Neural Networks  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00441.pdf)
>  Powerful adversarial attack methods are vital for understanding how to construct robust deep neural networks (DNNs) and for thoroughly testing defense techniques. In this paper, we propose a black-box adversarial attack algorithm that can defeat both vanilla DNNs and those generated by various defense techniques developed recently. Instead of searching for an "optimal" adversarial example for a benign input to a targeted DNN, our algorithm finds a probability density distribution over a small region centered around the input, such that a sample drawn from this distribution is likely an adversarial example, without the need of accessing the DNN's internal layers or weights. Our approach is universal as it can successfully attack different neural networks by a single algorithm. It is also strong; according to the testing against 2 vanilla DNNs and 13 defended ones, it outperforms state-of-the-art black-box or white-box attack methods for most test cases. Additionally, our results reveal that adversarial training remains one of the best defense techniques, and the adversarial examples are not as transferable across defended DNNs as them across vanilla DNNs. 
### 29.ResNet Can Be Pruned 60x: Introducing Network Purification and Unused Path Removal (P-RM) after Weight Pruning  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00136.pdf)
>  The state-of-art DNN structures involve high computation and great demand for memory storage which pose intensive challenge on DNN framework resources. To mitigate the challenges, weight pruning techniques has been studied. However, high accuracy solution for extreme structured pruning that combines different types of structured sparsity still waiting for unraveling due to the extremely reduced weights in DNN networks. In this paper, we propose a DNN framework which combines two different types of structured weight pruning (filter and column prune) by incorporating alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for better prune performance. We are the first to find non-optimality of ADMM process and unused weights in a structured pruned model, and further design an optimization framework which contains the first proposed Network Purification and Unused Path Removal algorithms which are dedicated to post-processing an structured pruned model after ADMM steps. Some high lights shows we achieve 232x compression on LeNet-5, 60x compression on ResNet-18 CIFAR-10 and over 5x compression on AlexNet.
