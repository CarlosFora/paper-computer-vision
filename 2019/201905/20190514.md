### 1.PIFu: Pixel-Aligned Implicit Function for High-Resolution Clothed Human Digitization  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05172.pdf)
>  We introduce Pixel-aligned Implicit Function (PIFu), a highly effective implicit representation that locally aligns pixels of 2D images with the global context of their corresponding 3D object. Using PIFu, we propose an end-to-end deep learning method for digitizing highly detailed clothed humans that can infer both 3D surface and texture from a single image, and optionally, multiple input images. Highly intricate shapes, such as hairstyles, clothing, as well as their variations and deformations can be digitized in a unified way. Compared to existing representations used for 3D deep learning, PIFu can produce high-resolution surfaces including largely unseen regions such as the back of a person. In particular, it is memory efficient unlike the voxel representation, can handle arbitrary topology, and the resulting surface is spatially aligned with the input image. Furthermore, while previous techniques are designed to process either a single image or multiple views, PIFu extends naturally to arbitrary number of views. We demonstrate high-resolution and robust reconstructions on real world images from the DeepFashion dataset, which contains a variety of challenging clothing types. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public benchmark and outperforms the prior work for clothed human digitization from a single image. 
### 2.Zoom To Learn, Learn To Zoom  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05169.pdf)
>  This paper shows that when applying machine learning to digital zoom for photography, it is beneficial to use real, RAW sensor data for training. Existing learning-based super-resolution methods do not use real sensor data, instead operating on RGB images. In practice, these approaches result in loss of detail and accuracy in their digitally zoomed output when zooming in on distant image regions. We also show that synthesizing sensor data by resampling high-resolution RGB images is an oversimplified approximation of real sensor data and noise, resulting in worse image quality. The key barrier to using real sensor data for training is that ground truth high-resolution imagery is missing. We show how to obtain the ground-truth data with optically zoomed images and contribute a dataset, SR-RAW, for real-world computational zoom. We use SR-RAW to train a deep network with a novel contextual bilateral loss (CoBi) that delivers critical robustness to mild misalignment in input-output image pairs. The trained network achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4X and 8X computational zoom. 
### 3.VideoGraph: Recognizing Minutes-Long Human Activities in Videos  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05143.pdf)
>  Many human activities take minutes to unfold. To represent them, related works opt for statistical pooling, which neglects the temporal structure. Others opt for convolutional methods, as CNN and Non-Local. While successful in learning temporal concepts, they are short of modeling minutes-long temporal dependencies. We propose VideoGraph, a method to achieve the best of two worlds: represent minutes-long human activities and learn their underlying temporal structure. VideoGraph learns a graph-based representation for human activities. The graph, its nodes and edges are learned entirely from video datasets, making VideoGraph applicable to problems without node-level annotation. The result is improvements over related works on benchmarks: Epic-Kitchen and Breakfast. Besides, we demonstrate that VideoGraph is able to learn the temporal structure of human activities in minutes-long videos. 
### 4.Block Coordinate Regularization by Denoising  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05113.pdf)
>  We consider the problem of estimating a vector from its noisy measurements using a prior specified only through a denoising function. Recent work on plug-and-play priors (PnP) and regularization-by-denoising (RED) has shown the state-of-the-art performance of estimators under such priors in a range of imaging tasks. In this work, we develop a new block coordinate RED algorithm that decomposes a large-scale estimation problem into a sequence of updates over a small subset of the unknown variables. We theoretically analyze the convergence of the algorithm and discuss its relationship to the traditional proximal optimization. Our analysis complements and extends recent theoretical results for RED-based estimation methods. We numerically validate our method using several denoiser priors, including those based on convolutional neural network (CNN) denoisers. 
### 5.Joint demosaicing and denoising by overfitting of bursts of raw images  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05092.pdf)
>  Demosaicking and denoising are the first steps of any camera image processing pipeline and are key for obtaining high quality RGB images. A promising current research trend aims at solving these two problems jointly using convolutional neural networks. Due to the unavailability of ground truth data these networks cannot be currently trained using real RAW images. Instead, they resort to simulated data. In this paper we present a method to learn demosacking directly from mosaicked images, without requiring ground truth RGB data. We apply this to learn joint demosaicking and denoising only from RAW images, thus enabling the use of real data. In addition we show that for this application overfitting a network to a specific burst improves the quality of restoration for both demosaicking and denoising. 
### 6.Weakly-supervised Caricature Face Parsing through Domain Adaptation  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05091.pdf)
>  A caricature is an artistic form of a person's picture in which certain striking characteristics are abstracted or exaggerated in order to create a humor or sarcasm effect. For numerous caricature related applications such as attribute recognition and caricature editing, face parsing is an essential pre-processing step that provides a complete facial structure understanding. However, current state-of-the-art face parsing methods require large amounts of labeled data on the pixel-level and such process for caricature is tedious and labor-intensive. For real photos, there are numerous labeled datasets for face parsing. Thus, we formulate caricature face parsing as a domain adaptation problem, where real photos play the role of the source domain, adapting to the target caricatures. Specifically, we first leverage a spatial transformer based network to enable shape domain shifts. A feed-forward style transfer network is then utilized to capture texture-level domain gaps. With these two steps, we synthesize face caricatures from real photos, and thus we can use parsing ground truths of the original photos to learn the parsing model. Experimental results on the synthetic and real caricatures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed domain adaptation algorithm.

### 7.A novel statistical metric learning for hyperspectral image classification  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05087.pdf)
>  In this paper, a novel statistical metric learning is developed for spectral-spatial classification of the hyperspectral image. First, the standard variance of the samples of each class in each batch is used to decrease the intra-class variance within each class. Then, the distances between the means of different classes are used to penalize the inter-class variance of the training samples. Finally, the standard variance between the means of different classes is added as an additional diversity term to repulse different classes from each other. Experiments have conducted over two real-world hyperspectral image datasets and the experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed statistical metric learning. 
### 8.Medical image super-resolution method based on dense blended attention network  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05084.pdf)
>  In order to address the issue that medical image would suffer from severe blurring caused by the lack of high-frequency details in the process of image super-resolution reconstruction, a novel medical image super-resolution method based on dense neural network and blended attention mechanism is proposed. The proposed method adds blended attention blocks to dense neural network(DenseNet), so that the neural network can concentrate more attention to the regions and channels with sufficient high-frequency details. Batch normalization layers are removed to avoid loss of high-frequency texture details. Final obtained high resolution medical image are obtained using deconvolutional layers at the very end of the network as up-sampling operators. Experimental results show that the proposed method has an improvement of 0.05db to 11.25dB and 0.6% to 14.04% on the peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR) metric and structural similarity index(SSIM) metric, respectively, compared with the mainstream image super-resolution methods. This work provides a new idea for theoretical studies of medical image super-resolution reconstruction. 
### 9.Object Detection in 20 Years: A Survey  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05055.pdf)
>  Object detection, as of one the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. Its development in the past two decades can be regarded as an epitome of computer vision history. If we think of today's object detection as a technical aesthetics under the power of deep learning, then turning back the clock 20 years we would witness the wisdom of cold weapon era. This paper extensively reviews 400+ papers of object detection in the light of its technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2019). A number of topics have been covered in this paper, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speed up techniques, and the recent state of the art detection methods. This paper also reviews some important detection applications, such as pedestrian detection, face detection, text detection, etc, and makes an in-deep analysis of their challenges as well as technical improvements in recent years. 
### 10.Precipitation nowcasting using a stochastic variational frame predictor with learned prior distribution  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05037.pdf)
>  We propose the use of a stochastic variational frame prediction deep neural network with a learned prior distribution trained on two-dimensional rain radar reflectivity maps for precipitation nowcasting with lead times of up to 2 1/2 hours. We present a comparison to a standard convolutional LSTM network and assess the evolution of the structural similarity index for both methods. Case studies are presented that illustrate that the novel methodology can yield meaningful forecasts without excessive blur for the time horizons of interest. 
### 11."The cracks that wanted to be a graph": application of image processing and Graph Neural Networks to the description of craquelure patterns  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05010.pdf)
>  Cracks on a painting is not a defect but an inimitable signature of an artwork which can be used for origin examination, aging monitoring, damage identification, and even forgery detection. This work presents the development of a new methodology and corresponding toolbox for the extraction and characterization of information from an image of a craquelure pattern. The proposed approach processes craquelure network as a graph. The graph representation captures the network structure via mutual organization of junctions and fractures. Furthermore, it is invariant to any geometrical distortions. At the same time, our tool extracts the properties of each node and edge individually, which allows to characterize the pattern statistically. We illustrate benefits from the graph representation and statistical features individually using novel Graph Neural Network and hand-crafted descriptors correspondingly. However, we also show that the best performance is achieved when both techniques are merged into one framework. We perform experiments on the dataset for paintings' origin classification and demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing techniques by a large margin. 
### 12.Few-Shot Viewpoint Estimation  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04957.pdf)
>  Viewpoint estimation for known categories of objects has been improved significantly thanks to deep networks and large datasets, but generalization to unknown categories is still very challenging. With an aim towards improving performance on unknown categories, we introduce the problem of category-level few-shot viewpoint estimation. We design a novel framework to successfully train viewpoint networks for new categories with few examples (10 or less). We formulate the problem as one of learning to estimate category-specific 3D canonical shapes, their associated depth estimates, and semantic 2D keypoints. We apply meta-learning to learn weights for our network that are amenable to category-specific few-shot fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a flexible meta-Siamese network that maximizes information sharing during meta-learning. Through extensive experimentation on the ObjectNet3D and Pascal3D+ benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our framework, which we call MetaView, significantly outperforms fine-tuning the state-of-the-art models with few examples, and that the specific architectural innovations of our method are crucial to achieving good performance. 
### 13.CutMix: Regularization Strategy to Train Strong Classifiers with Localizable Features  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04899.pdf)
>  Regional dropout strategies have been proposed to enhance the performance of convolutional neural network classifiers. They have proved to be effective for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts of objects (\eg leg as opposed to head of a person), thereby letting the network generalize better and have better object localization capabilities. On the other hand, current methods for regional dropout removes informative pixels on training images by overlaying a patch of either black pixels or random noise. {Such removal is not desirable because it leads to information loss and inefficiency during training.} We therefore propose the CutMix augmentation strategy: patches are cut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally to the area of the patches. By making efficient use of training pixels and \mbox{retaining} the regularization effect of regional dropout, CutMix consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, as well as on the ImageNet weakly-supervised localization task. Moreover, unlike previous augmentation methods, our CutMix-trained ImageNet classifier, when used as a pretrained model, results in consistent performance gains in Pascal detection and MS-COCO image captioning benchmarks. We also show that CutMix improves the model robustness against input corruptions and its out-of-distribution detection performances. 
### 14.FPGA-based Binocular Image Feature Extraction and Matching System  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04890.pdf)
>  Image feature extraction and matching is a fundamental but computation intensive task in machine vision. This paper proposes a novel FPGA-based embedded system to accelerate feature extraction and matching. It implements SURF feature point detection and BRIEF feature descriptor construction and matching. For binocular stereo vision, feature matching includes both tracking matching and stereo matching, which simultaneously provide feature point correspondences and parallax information. Our system is evaluated on a ZYNQ XC7Z045 FPGA. The result demonstrates that it can process binocular video data at a high frame rate (640$\times$480 @ 162fps). Moreover, an extensive test proves our system has robustness for image compression, blurring and illumination. 
### 15.Quantifying and Alleviating the Language Prior Problem in Visual Question Answering  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04877.pdf)
>  Benefiting from the advancement of computer vision, natural language processing and information retrieval techniques, visual question answering (VQA), which aims to answer questions about an image or a video, has received lots of attentions over the past few years. Although some progress has been achieved so far, several studies have pointed out that current VQA models are heavily affected by the \emph{language prior problem}, which means they tend to answer questions based on the co-occurrence patterns of question keywords (e.g., how many) and answers (e.g., 2) instead of understanding images and questions. Existing methods attempt to solve this problem by either balancing the biased datasets or forcing models to better understand images. However, only marginal effects and even performance deterioration are observed for the first and second solution, respectively. In addition, another important issue is the lack of measurement to quantitatively measure the extent of the language prior effect, which severely hinders the advancement of related techniques. <br>In this paper, we make contributions to solve the above problems from two perspectives. Firstly, we design a metric to quantitatively measure the language prior effect of VQA models. The proposed metric has been demonstrated to be effective in our empirical studies. Secondly, we propose a regularization method (i.e., score regularization module) to enhance current VQA models by alleviating the language prior problem as well as boosting the backbone model performance. The proposed score regularization module adopts a pair-wise learning strategy, which makes the VQA models answer the question based on the reasoning of the image (upon this question) instead of basing on question-answer patterns observed in the biased training set. The score regularization module is flexible to be integrated into various VQA models. 
### 16.Group Re-identification via Transferred Single and Couple Representation Learning  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04854.pdf)
>  Group re-identification (G-ReID) is an important yet less-studied task. Its challenges not only lie in appearance changes of individuals which have been well-investigated in general person re-identification (ReID), but also derive from group layout and membership changes. So the key task of G-ReID is to learn representations robust to such changes. To address this issue, we propose a Transferred Single and Couple Representation Learning Network (TSCN). Its merits are two aspects: 1) Due to the lack of labelled training samples, existing G-ReID methods mainly rely on unsatisfactory hand-crafted features. To gain the superiority of deep learning models, we treat a group as multiple persons and transfer the domain of a labeled ReID dataset to a G-ReID target dataset style to learn single representations. 2) Taking into account the neighborhood relationship in a group, we further propose learning a novel couple representation between two group members, that achieves more discriminative power in G-ReID tasks. In addition, an unsupervised weight learning method is exploited to adaptively fuse the results of different views together according to result patterns. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 11.7\% CMC-1 on the Road Group dataset and by 39.0\% CMC-1 on the DukeMCMT dataset. 
### 17.A High-Efficiency Framework for Constructing Large-Scale Face Parsing Benchmark  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04830.pdf)
>  Face parsing, which is to assign a semantic label to each pixel in face images, has recently attracted increasing interest due to its huge application potentials. Although many face related fields (e.g., face recognition and face detection) have been well studied for many years, the existing datasets for face parsing are still severely limited in terms of the scale and quality, e.g., the widely used Helen dataset only contains 2,330 images. This is mainly because pixel-level annotation is a high cost and time-consuming work, especially for the facial parts without clear boundaries. The lack of accurate annotated datasets becomes a major obstacle in the progress of face parsing task. It is a feasible way to utilize dense facial landmarks to guide the parsing annotation. However, annotating dense landmarks on human face encounters the same issues as the parsing annotation. To overcome the above problems, in this paper, we develop a high-efficiency framework for face parsing annotation, which considerably simplifies and speeds up the parsing annotation by two consecutive modules. Benefit from the proposed framework, we construct a new Dense Landmark Guided Face Parsing (LaPa) benchmark. It consists of 22,000 face images with large variations in expression, pose, occlusion, etc. Each image is provided with accurate annotation of a 11-category pixel-level label map along with coordinates of 106-point landmarks. To the best of our knowledge, it is currently the largest public dataset for face parsing. To make full use of our LaPa dataset with abundant face shape and boundary priors, we propose a simple yet effective Boundary-Sensitive Parsing Network (BSPNet). Our network is taken as a baseline model on the proposed LaPa dataset, and meanwhile, it achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Helen dataset without resorting to extra face alignment. 
### 18.Leveraging synthetic imagery for collision-at-sea avoidance  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04828.pdf)
>  Maritime collisions involving multiple ships are considered rare, but in 2017 several United States Navy vessels were involved in fatal at-sea collisions that resulted in the death of seventeen American Servicemembers. The experimentation introduced in this paper is a direct response to these incidents. We propose a shipboard Collision-At-Sea avoidance system, based on video image processing, that will help ensure the safe stationing and navigation of maritime vessels. Our system leverages a convolutional neural network trained on synthetic maritime imagery in order to detect nearby vessels within a scene, perform heading analysis of detected vessels, and provide an alert in the presence of an inbound vessel. Additionally, we present the Navigational Hazards - Synthetic (NAVHAZ-Synthetic) dataset. This dataset, is comprised of one million annotated images of ten vessel classes observed from virtual vessel-mounted cameras, as well as a human "Topside Lookout" perspective. NAVHAZ-Synthetic includes imagery displaying varying sea-states, lighting conditions, and optical degradations such as fog, sea-spray, and salt-accumulation. We present our results on the use of synthetic imagery in a computer vision based collision-at-sea warning system with promising performance. 
### 19.Video Instance Segmentation  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04804.pdf)
>  In this paper we present a new computer vision task, named video instance segmentation. The goal of this new task is simultaneous detection, segmentation and tracking of instances in videos. In words, it is the first time that the image instance segmentation problem is extended to the video domain. To facilitate research on this new task, we propose a large-scale benchmark called YouTube-VIS, which consists of 2883 high-resolution YouTube videos, a 40-category label set and 131k high-quality instance masks. In addition, we propose a novel algorithm called MaskTrack R-CNN for this task. Our new method introduces a new tracking branch to Mask R-CNN to jointly perform the detection, segmentation and tracking tasks simultaneously. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method and several strong baselines on our new dataset. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm and reveal insight for future improvement. We believe the video instance segmentation task will motivate the community along the line of research for video understanding. 
### 20.DeepIlluminance: Contextual Illuminance Estimation via Deep Neural Networks  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04791.pdf)
>  Computational color constancy refers to the estimation of the scene illumination and makes the perceived color relatively stable under varying illumination. In the past few years, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have delivered superior performance in illuminant estimation. Several representative methods formulate it as a multi-label prediction problem by learning the local appearance of image patches using CNNs. However, these approaches inevitably make incorrect estimations for the ambiguous patches affected by their neighborhood contexts. Inaccurate local estimates are likely to bring in degraded performance when combining into a global prediction. To address the above issues, we propose a contextual deep network for patch-based illuminant estimation equipped with refinement. First, the contextual net with a center-surround architecture extracts local contextual features from image patches, and generates initial illuminant estimates and the corresponding color corrected patches. The patches are sampled based on the observation that pixels with large color differences describe the illumination well. Then, the refinement net integrates the input patches with the corrected patches in conjunction with the use of intermediate features to improve the performance. To train such a network with numerous parameters, we propose a stage-wise training strategy, in which the features and the predicted illuminant from previous stages are provided to the next learning stage with more finer estimates recovered. Experiments show that our approach obtains competitive performance on two illuminant estimation benchmarks. 
### 21.Structure from Articulated Motion: An Accurate and Stable Monocular 3D Reconstruction Approach without Training Data  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04789.pdf)
>  Recovery of articulated 3D structure from 2D observations is a challenging computer vision problem with many applications. Current learning-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks but are limited to the specific types of objects and motions covered by the training datasets. Model-based approaches do not rely on training data but show lower accuracy on public benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a new model-based method called Structure from Articulated Motion (SfAM). SfAM includes a new articulated structure term which ensures consistency of bone lengths throughout the whole image sequence and recovers a scene-specific configuration of the articulated structure. The proposed approach is highly robust to noisy 2D annotations, generalizes to arbitrary objects and motion types and does not rely on training data. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scales across different scenarios which is shown in extensive experiments on public benchmarks and real video sequences. 
### 22.NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04757.pdf)
>  Research on depth-based human activity analysis achieved outstanding performance and demonstrated the effectiveness of 3D representation for action recognition. The existing depth-based and RGB+D-based action recognition benchmarks have a number of limitations, including the lack of large-scale training samples, realistic number of distinct class categories, diversity in camera views, varied environmental conditions, and variety of human subjects. In this work, we introduce a large-scale dataset for RGB+D human action recognition, which is collected from 106 distinct subjects and contains more than 114 thousand video samples and 8 million frames. This dataset contains 120 different action classes including daily, mutual, and health-related activities. We evaluate the performance of a series of existing 3D activity analysis methods on this dataset, and show the advantage of applying deep learning methods for 3D-based human action recognition. Furthermore, we investigate a novel one-shot 3D activity recognition problem on our dataset, and a simple yet effective Action-Part Semantic Relevance-aware (APSR) framework is proposed for this task, which yields promising results for recognition of the novel action classes. We believe the introduction of this large-scale dataset will enable the community to apply, adapt, and develop various data-hungry learning techniques for depth-based and RGB+D-based human activity understanding. [The dataset is available at: <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/Datasets/actionRecognition.asp" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a>] 
### 23.Budgeted Training: Rethinking Deep Neural Network Training Under Resource Constraints  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04753.pdf)
>  In most practical settings and theoretical analysis, one assumes that a model can be trained until convergence. However, the growing complexity of machine learning datasets and models may violate such assumptions. Moreover, current approaches for hyper-parameter tuning and neural architecture search tend to be limited by practical resource constraints. Therefore, we introduce a formal setting for studying training under the non-asymptotic, resource-constrained regime, i.e. budgeted training. We analyze the following problem: "given a dataset, algorithm, and resource budget, what is the best achievable performance?" We focus on the number of optimization iterations as the representative resource. Under such a setting, we show that it is critical to adjust the learning rate schedule according to the given budget. Among budget-aware learning schedules, we find simple linear decay to be both robust and high-performing. We support our claim through extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models on ImageNet (image classification), Cityscapes (semantic segmentation), MS COCO (object detection and instance segmentation), and Kinetics (video classification). We also analyze our results and find that the key to a good schedule is budgeted convergence, a phenomenon whereby the gradient vanishes at the end of each allowed budget. We also revisit existing approaches for fast convergence, and show that budget-aware learning schedules readily outperform such approaches under (the practical but under-explored) budgeted setting. 
### 24.Object Detection in Specific Traffic Scenes using YOLOv2  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04740.pdf)
>  object detection framework plays crucial role in autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce the real-time object detection framework called You Only Look Once (YOLOv1) and the related improvements of YOLOv2. We further explore the capability of YOLOv2 by implementing its pre-trained model to do the object detecting tasks in some specific traffic scenes. The four artificially designed traffic scenes include single-car, single-person, frontperson-rearcar and frontcar-rearperson. 
### 25.Social Relation Recognition in Egocentric Photostreams  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04734.pdf)
>  This paper proposes an approach to automatically categorize the social interactions of a user wearing a photo-camera 2fpm, by relying solely on what the camera is seeing. The problem is challenging due to the overwhelming complexity of social life and the extreme intra-class variability of social interactions captured under unconstrained conditions. We adopt the formalization proposed in Bugental's social theory, that groups human relations into five social domains with related categories. Our method is a new deep learning architecture that exploits the hierarchical structure of the label space and relies on a set of social attributes estimated at frame level to provide a semantic representation of social interactions. Experimental results on the new EgoSocialRelation dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal. 
### 26.One-Shot Image-to-Image Translation via Part-Global Learning with a Multi-adversarial Framework  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04729.pdf)
>  It is well known that humans can learn and recognize objects effectively from several limited image samples. However, learning from just a few images is still a tremendous challenge for existing main-stream deep neural networks. Inspired by analogical reasoning in the human mind, a feasible strategy is to translate the abundant images of a rich source domain to enrich the relevant yet different target domain with insufficient image data. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel, effective multi-adversarial framework (MA) based on part-global learning, which accomplishes one-shot cross-domain image-to-image translation. In specific, we first devise a part-global adversarial training scheme to provide an efficient way for feature extraction and prevent discriminators being over-fitted. Then, a multi-adversarial mechanism is employed to enhance the image-to-image translation ability to unearth the high-level semantic representation. Moreover, a balanced adversarial loss function is presented, which aims to balance the training data and stabilize the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can obtain impressive results on various datasets between two extremely imbalanced image domains and outperform state-of-the-art methods on one-shot image-to-image translation. 
### 27.Some Research Problems in Biometrics: The Future Beckons  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04717.pdf)
>  The need for reliably determining the identity of a person is critical in a number of different domains ranging from personal smartphones to border security; from autonomous vehicles to e-voting; from tracking child vaccinations to preventing human trafficking; from crime scene investigation to personalization of customer service. Biometrics, which entails the use of biological attributes such as face, fingerprints and voice for recognizing a person, is being increasingly used in several such applications. While biometric technology has made rapid strides over the past decade, there are several fundamental issues that are yet to be satisfactorily resolved. In this article, we will discuss some of these issues and enumerate some of the exciting challenges in this field. 
### 28.Ensemble Super-Resolution with A Reference Dataset  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04696.pdf)
>  By developing sophisticated image priors or designing deep(er) architectures, a variety of image Super-Resolution (SR) approaches have been proposed recently and achieved very promising performance. A natural question that arises is whether these methods can be reformulated into a unifying framework and whether this framework assists in SR reconstruction? In this paper, we present a simple but effective single image SR method based on ensemble learning, which can produce a better performance than that could be obtained from any of SR methods to be ensembled (or called component super-resolvers). Based on the assumption that better component super-resolver should have larger ensemble weight when performing SR reconstruction, we present a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation framework for the inference of optimal ensemble weights. Specially, we introduce a reference dataset, which is composed of High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) image pairs, to measure the super-resolution abilities (prior knowledge) of different component super-resolvers. To obtain the optimal ensemble weights, we propose to incorporate the reconstruction constraint, which states that the degenerated HR image should be equal to the LR observation one, as well as the prior knowledge of ensemble weights into the MAP estimation framework. Moreover, the proposed optimization problem can be solved by an analytical solution. We study the performance of the proposed method by comparing with different competitive approaches, including four state-of-the-art non-deep learning based methods, four latest deep learning based methods and one ensemble learning based method, and prove its effectiveness and superiority on three public datasets. 
### 29.Adaptive Composition GAN towards Realistic Image Synthesis  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04693.pdf)
>  Despite the rapid progress of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in image synthesis in recent years, current approaches work in either geometry domain or appearance domain which tend to introduce various synthesis artifacts. This paper presents an innovative Adaptive Composition GAN (AC-GAN) that incorporates image synthesis in geometry and appearance domains into an end-to-end trainable network and achieves synthesis realism in both domains simultaneously. An innovative hierarchical synthesis mechanism is designed which is capable of generating realistic geometry and composition when multiple foreground objects with or without occlusions are involved in synthesis. In addition, a novel attention mask is introduced to guide the appearance adaptation to the embedded foreground objects which helps preserve image details and resolution and also provide better reference for synthesis in geometry domain. Extensive experiments on scene text image synthesis, automated portrait editing and indoor rendering tasks show that the proposed AC-GAN achieves superior synthesis performance qualitatively and quantitatively. 
### 30.On Flow Profile Image for Video Representation  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04668.pdf)
>  Video representation is a key challenge in many computer vision applications such as video classification, video captioning, and video surveillance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for video representation that captures meaningful information including motion and appearance from a sequence of video frames and compacts it into a single image. To this end, we compute the optical flow and use it in a least squares optimization to find a new image, the so-called Flow Profile Image (FPI). This image encodes motions as well as foreground appearance information while background information is removed. The quality of this image is validated in activity recognition experiments and the results are compared with other video representation techniques such as dynamic images [1] and eigen images [2]. The experimental results as well as visual quality confirm that FPIs can be successfully used in video processing applications. 
### 31.Predictive Ensemble Learning with Application to Scene Text Detection  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04641.pdf)
>  Deep learning based approaches have achieved significant progresses in different tasks like classification, detection, segmentation, and so on. Ensemble learning is widely known to further improve performance by combining multiple complementary models. It is easy to apply ensemble learning for classification tasks, for example, based on averaging, voting, or other methods. However, for other tasks (like object detection) where the outputs are varying in quantity and unable to be simply compared, the ensemble of multiple models become difficult. In this paper, we propose a new method called Predictive Ensemble Learning (PEL), based on powerful predictive ability of deep neural networks, to directly predict the best performing model among a pool of base models for each test example, thus transforming ensemble learning to a traditional classification task. Taking scene text detection as the application, where no suitable ensemble learning strategy exists, PEL can significantly improve the performance, compared to either individual state-of-the-art models, or the fusion of multiple models by non-maximum suppression. Experimental results show the possibility and potential of PEL in predicting different models' performance based only on a query example, which can be extended for ensemble learning in many other complex tasks. 
### 32.Robustness of Object Recognition under Extreme Occlusion in Humans and Computational Models  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04598.pdf)
>  Most objects in the visual world are partially occluded, but humans can recognize them without difficulty. However, it remains unknown whether object recognition models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can handle real-world occlusion. It is also a question whether efforts to make these models robust to constant mask occlusion are effective for real-world occlusion. We test both humans and the above-mentioned computational models in a challenging task of object recognition under extreme occlusion, where target objects are heavily occluded by irrelevant real objects in real backgrounds. Our results show that human vision is very robust to extreme occlusion while CNNs are not, even with modifications to handle constant mask occlusion. This implies that the ability to handle constant mask occlusion does not entail robustness to real-world occlusion. As a comparison, we propose another computational model that utilizes object parts/subparts in a compositional manner to build robustness to occlusion. This performs significantly better than CNN-based models on our task with error patterns similar to humans. These findings suggest that testing under extreme occlusion can better reveal the robustness of visual recognition, and that the principle of composition can encourage such robustness. 
### 33.Deep Unsupervised Learning of 3D Point Clouds via Graph Topology Inference and Filtering  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04571.pdf)
>  We propose a deep autoencoder with graph topology inference and filtering to achieve compact representations of unorganized 3D point clouds in an unsupervised manner. The encoder of the proposed networks adopts similar architectures as in PointNet, which is a well-acknowledged method for supervised learning of 3D point clouds. The decoder of the proposed networks involves three novel modules: the folding module, the graph-topology-inference module, and the graph-filtering module. The folding module folds a canonical 2D lattice to the underlying surface of a 3D point cloud, achieving coarse reconstruction; the graph-topology-inference module learns a graph topology to represent pairwise relationships between 3D points; and the graph-filtering module designs graph filters based on the learnt graph topology to obtain the refined reconstruction. We further provide theoretical analyses of the proposed architecture. We provide an upper bound for the reconstruction loss and further show the superiority of graph smoothness over spatial smoothness as a prior to model 3D point clouds. In the experiments, we validate the proposed networks in three tasks, including reconstruction, visualization, and classification. The experimental results show that (1) the proposed networks outperform the state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, including reconstruction and transfer classification; (2) a graph topology can be inferred as auxiliary information without specific supervision on graph topology inference; and (3) graph filtering refines the reconstruction, leading to better performances. 
### 34.Disentangling Content and Style via Unsupervised Geometry Distillation  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04538.pdf)
>  It is challenging to disentangle an object into two orthogonal spaces of content and style since each can influence the visual observation differently and unpredictably. It is rare for one to have access to a large number of data to help separate the influences. In this paper, we present a novel framework to learn this disentangled representation in a completely unsupervised manner. We address this problem in a two-branch Autoencoder framework. For the structural content branch, we project the latent factor into a soft structured point tensor and constrain it with losses derived from prior knowledge. This constraint encourages the branch to distill geometry information. Another branch learns the complementary style information. The two branches form an effective framework that can disentangle object's content-style representation without any human annotation. We evaluate our approach on four image datasets, on which we demonstrate the superior disentanglement and visual analogy quality both in synthesized and real-world data. We are able to generate photo-realistic images with 256*256 resolution that are clearly disentangled in content and style. 
### 35.Multitask deep learning with spectral knowledge for hyperspectral image classification  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04535.pdf)
>  In this letter, we introduce multitask learning to hyperspectral image classification. Deep learning models have achieved promising results on hyperspectral image classification, but their performance highly rely on sufficient labeled samples, which are scarce on hyperspectral images. However, samples from multiple data sets might be sufficient to train one deep learning model, thereby improving its performance. To do so, spectral knowledge is introduced to ensure that the shared features are similar across domains. Four hyperspectral data sets were used in the experiments. We achieved better classification accuracies on three data sets (Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Pavia Center) originally with poor results or simple classification systems and competitive results on Salinas Valley data originally with a complex classification system. Spectral knowledge is useful to prevent the deep network from overfitting when the training samples were scarce. The proposed method successfully utilized samples from multiple data sets to increase its performance. 
### 36.Illumination-Adaptive Person Re-identification  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04525.pdf)
>  Most person re-identification (ReID) approaches assume that person images are captured under relatively similar illumination conditions. In reality, long-term person retrieval is common and person images are captured under different illumination conditions at different times across a day. In this situation, the performances of existing ReID models often degrade dramatically. This paper addresses the ReID problem with illumination variations and names it as {\em Illumination-Adaptive Person Re-identification (IA-ReID)}. We propose an Illumination-Identity Disentanglement (IID) network to separate different scales of illuminations apart, while preserving individuals' identity information. To demonstrate the illumination issue and to evaluate our network, we construct two large-scale simulated datasets with a wide range of illumination variations. Experimental results on the simulated datasets and real-world images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. 
### 37.Segregation Network for Multi-Class Novelty Detection  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04523.pdf)
>  The problem of multiple class novelty detection is gaining increasing importance due to the large availability of multimedia data and the increasing requirement of the classification models to work in an open set scenario. To this end, novelty detection tries to answer this important question: given a test example should we even try to classify it? In this work, we design a novel deep learning framework, termed Segregation Network, which is trained using the mixup technique. We construct interpolated points using convex combinations of pairs of training data and use our novel loss function for prediction of its constituent classes. During testing, for each input query, mixed samples with the known class prototypes are generated and passed through the proposed network. The output of the network reveals the constituent classes which can be used to determine whether the incoming data is from the known class set or not. Our algorithm is trained using just the data from the known classes and does not require any auxiliary dataset or attributes. Extensive evaluation on two benchmark datasets namely Caltech-256 and Stanford Dogs and comparison with the state-of-the-art justifies the effectiveness of the proposed framework. 
### 38.Unified Generator-Classifier for Efficient Zero-Shot Learning  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04511.pdf)
>  Generative models have achieved state-of-the-art performance for the zero-shot learning problem, but they require re-training the classifier every time a new object category is encountered. The traditional semantic embedding approaches, though very elegant, usually do not perform at par with their generative counterparts. In this work, we propose an unified framework termed GenClass, which integrates the generator with the classifier for efficient zero-shot learning, thus combining the representative power of the generative approaches and the elegance of the embedding approaches. End-to-end training of the unified framework not only eliminates the requirement of additional classifier for new object categories as in the generative approaches, but also facilitates the generation of more discriminative and useful features. Extensive evaluation on three standard zero-shot object classification datasets, namely AWA, CUB and SUN shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The approach without any modification, also gives state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot action classification, thus showing its generalizability to other domains. 
### 39.Deep Zero-Shot Learning for Scene Sketch  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04510.pdf)
>  We introduce a novel problem of scene sketch zero-shot learning (SSZSL), which is a challenging task, since (i) different from photo, the gap between common semantic domain (e.g., word vector) and sketch is too huge to exploit common semantic knowledge as the bridge for knowledge transfer, and (ii) compared with single-object sketch, more expressive feature representation for scene sketch is required to accommodate its high-level of abstraction and complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a deep embedding model for scene sketch zero-shot learning. In particular, we propose the augmented semantic vector to conduct domain alignment by fusing multi-modal semantic knowledge (e.g., cartoon image, natural image, text description), and adopt attention-based network for scene sketch feature learning. Moreover, we propose a novel distance metric to improve the similarity measure during testing. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the benefit of our sketch-specific design. 
### 40.Monocular Depth Estimation with Directional Consistency by Deep Networks  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04467.pdf)
>  As processing power has become more available, more human-like artificial intelligences are created to solve image processing tasks that we are inherently good at. As such we propose a model that estimates depth from a monocular image. Our approach utilizes a combination of structure from motion and stereo disparity. We estimate a pose between the source image and a different viewpoint and a dense depth map and use a simple transformation to reconstruct the image seen from said viewpoint. We can then use the real image at that viewpoint to act as supervision to train out model. The metric chosen for image comparison employs standard L1 and structural similarity and a consistency constraint between depth maps as well as smoothness constraint. We show that similar to human perception utilizing the correlation within the provided data by two different approaches increases the accuracy and outperforms the individual components. 
### 41.Triplet Distillation for Deep Face Recognition  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04457.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved a great success in face recognition, which unfortunately comes at the cost of massive computation and storage consumption. Many compact face recognition networks are thus proposed to resolve this problem. Triplet loss is effective to further improve the performance of those compact models. However, it normally employs a fixed margin to all the samples, which neglects the informative similarity structures between different identities. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of triplet loss, named triplet distillation, which exploits the capability of a teacher model to transfer the similarity information to a small model by adaptively varying the margin between positive and negative pairs. Experiments on LFW, AgeDB, and CPLFW datasets show the merits of our method compared to the original triplet loss. 
### 42.Self-Supervised Visual Place Recognition Learning in Mobile Robots  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04453.pdf)
>  Place recognition is a critical component in robot navigation that enables it to re-establish previously visited locations, and simultaneously use this information to correct the drift incurred in its dead-reckoned estimate. In this work, we develop a self-supervised approach to place recognition in robots. The task of visual loop-closure identification is cast as a metric learning problem, where the labels for positive and negative examples of loop-closures can be bootstrapped using a GPS-aided navigation solution that the robot already uses. By leveraging the synchronization between sensors, we show that we are able to learn an appropriate distance metric for arbitrary real-valued image descriptors (including state-of-the-art CNN models), that is specifically geared for visual place recognition in mobile robots. Furthermore, we show that the newly learned embedding can be particularly powerful in disambiguating visual scenes for the task of vision-based loop-closure identification in mobile robots. 
### 43.Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation via Gaze Decomposition and Single Gaze Point Calibration  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04451.pdf)
>  Appearance-based gaze estimation provides relatively unconstrained gaze tracking. However, subject-indepen\-dent models achieve limited accuracy partly due to individual variations. To improve estimation, we propose a novel gaze decomposition method and a single gaze point calibration method, motivated by our finding that the inter-subject squared bias exceeds the intra-subject variance for a subject-independent estimator. We decompose the gaze angle into a subject-dependent bias term and a subject-independent difference term between the gaze angle and the bias. The difference term is estimated by a deep convolutional network. For calibration-free tracking, we set the subject-dependent bias term to zero. For single gaze point calibration, we estimate the bias from a few images taken as the subject gazes at a point. Experiments on three datasets indicate that as a calibration-free estimator, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods that use single model by up to $10.0\%$. The proposed calibration method is robust and reduces estimation error significantly (up to $35.6\%$), achieving state-of-the-art performance for appearance-based eye trackers with calibration. 
### 44.Deep Plug-and-play Prior for Low-rank Tensor Completion  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04449.pdf)
>  Tensor image data sets such as color images and multispectral images are highly correlated and they contain a lot of image details. The main aim of this paper is to propose and develop a regularized tensor completion model for tensor image data completion. In the objective function, we adopt the newly emerged tensor nuclear norm (TNN) to characterize the global structure of such tensor image data sets. Also, we formulate an implicit regularizer to plug in the convolutional neural network (CNN) denoiser, which is convinced to express the image prior learned from a large amount of natural images. The resulting model can be solved efficiently via an alternating directional method of multipliers algorithm. Experimental results (on color images, videos, and multispectral images) are presented to show that both image global structure and details can be recovered very well, and to illustrate that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of testing methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM. 
### 45.Play and Prune: Adaptive Filter Pruning for Deep Model Compression  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04446.pdf)
>  While convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved impressive performance on various classification/recognition tasks, they typically consist of a massive number of parameters. This results in significant memory requirement as well as computational overheads. Consequently, there is a growing need for filter-level pruning approaches for compressing CNN based models that not only reduce the total number of parameters but reduce the overall computation as well. We present a new min-max framework for filter-level pruning of CNNs. Our framework, called Play and Prune (PP), jointly prunes and fine-tunes CNN model parameters, with an adaptive pruning rate, while maintaining the model's predictive performance. Our framework consists of two modules: (1) An adaptive filter pruning (AFP) module, which minimizes the number of filters in the model; and (2) A pruning rate controller (PRC) module, which maximizes the accuracy during pruning. Moreover, unlike most previous approaches, our approach allows directly specifying the desired error tolerance instead of pruning level. Our compressed models can be deployed at run-time, without requiring any special libraries or hardware. Our approach reduces the number of parameters of VGG-16 by an impressive factor of 17.5X, and number of FLOPS by 6.43X, with no loss of accuracy, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art filter pruning methods. 
### 46.Joint Learning of Self-Representation and Indicator for Multi-View Image Clustering  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04432.pdf)
>  Multi-view subspace clustering aims to divide a set of multisource data into several groups according to their underlying subspace structure. Although the spectral clustering based methods achieve promotion in multi-view clustering, their utility is limited by the separate learning manner in which affinity matrix construction and cluster indicator estimation are isolated. In this paper, we propose to jointly learn the self-representation, continue and discrete cluster indicators in an unified model. Our model can explore the subspace structure of each view and fusion them to facilitate clustering simultaneously. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing competitive multi-view clustering methods. 
### 47.Follow the Attention: Combining Partial Pose and Object Motion for Fine-Grained Action Detection  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04430.pdf)
>  Activity recognition in shopping environments is an important and challenging computer vision task. We introduce a framework for integrating human body pose and object motion to both temporally detect and classify the activities in a fine-grained manner (very short and similar activities). We achieve this by proposing a multi-stream recurrent convolutional neural network architecture guided by the spatiotemporal \emph{attention} mechanism for both activity recognition and detection. To this end, in the absence of accurate pose supervision, we incorporate generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate candidate body joints. Additionally, based on the intuition that complex actions demand more than one source of information to be precisely identified even by humans, we integrate the second stream of the object motion to our network that acts as a prior knowledge which we quantitatively show improves the results. Furthermore, we empirically show the capabilities of our approach by achieving state-of-the-art results on MERL shopping dataset. Finally, we further investigate the effectiveness of this approach on a new shopping dataset that we have collected to address existing shortcomings in this area including but not limited to lack of training data. 
### 48.Cyclone intensity estimate with context-aware cyclegan  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04425.pdf)
>  Deep learning approaches to cyclone intensity estimationhave recently shown promising results. However, sufferingfrom the extreme scarcity of cyclone data on specific in-tensity, most existing deep learning methods fail to achievesatisfactory performance on cyclone intensity estimation,especially on classes with few instances. To avoid the degra-dation of recognition performance caused by scarce samples,we propose a context-aware CycleGAN which learns the la-tent evolution features from adjacent cyclone intensity andsynthesizes CNN features of classes lacking samples fromunpaired source classes. Specifically, our approach synthe-sizes features conditioned on the learned evolution features,while the extra information is not required. Experimentalresults of several evaluation methods show the effectivenessof our approach, even can predicting unseen classes. 
### 49.Structured Discriminative Tensor Dictionary Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04424.pdf)
>  Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses the problem of performance degradation due to domain shift between training and testing sets, which is common in computer vision applications. Most existing UDA approaches are based on vector-form data although the typical format of data or features in visual applications is multi-dimensional tensor. Besides, current methods, including the deep network approaches, assume that abundant labeled source samples are provided for training. However, the number of labeled source samples are always limited due to expensive annotation cost in practice, making sub-optimal performance been observed. In this paper, we propose to seek discriminative representation for multi-dimensional data by learning a structured dictionary in tensor space. The dictionary separates domain-specific information and class-specific information to guarantee the representation robust to domains. In addition, a pseudo-label estimation scheme is developed to combine with discriminant analysis in the algorithm iteration for avoiding the external classifier design. We perform extensive results on different datasets with limited source samples. Experimental results demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 50.Novel Long Short-Term Memory Cell Architectures: Application to Light Field Face Recognition  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04421.pdf)
>  With the emergence of lenslet light field cameras able to capture rich spatio-angular information from multiple directions, new frontiers in visual recognition performance have been opened. Since multiple 2D viewpoint images can be rendered from a light field, those multiple images, or descriptions extracted from them, can be organized as a pseudo-video sequence so that a LSTM network learns a model describing that sequence. This paper proposes three novel LSTM cell architectures able to create richer and more effective description models for visual recognition tasks, by jointly learning from two sequences simultaneously acquired. The novel key idea is to jointly process two sequences of rendered 2D images or their descriptions, e.g. representing the scene horizontal and vertical parallaxes, and thus with some specific dependency between them, that would not be exploited otherwise. To show the efficiency of the novel LSTM cell architectures, these architectures have been integrated into an end-to-end deep learning face recognition framework, which creates this join spatio-angular light field description. The LSTM network, using the proposed LSTM cell architectures, receives as input a sequence of VGG-Face descriptions computed for parallax related, horizontal and vertical 2D face viewpoint images, derived from the input light field image. A comprehensive evaluation in terms of recognition accuracy, computational complexity, memory efficiency, and parallelization ability has been performed with the IST EURECOM LFFD database using three new and challenging evaluation protocols. The obtained results show the superior performance of the proposed face recognition solutions adopting the novel LSTM cell architectures over ten state-of-the-art benchmarking recognition solutions. 
### 51.Language-Conditioned Graph Networks for Relational Reasoning  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04405.pdf)
>  Solving grounded language tasks often requires reasoning about relationships between objects in the context of a given task. For example, to answer the question ``What color is the mug on the plate?'' we must check the color of the specific mug that satisfies the ``on'' relationship with respect to the plate. Recent work has proposed various methods capable of complex relational reasoning. However, most of their power is in the inference structure, while the scene is represented with simple local appearance features. In this paper, we take an alternate approach and build contextualized representations for objects in a visual scene to support relational reasoning. We propose a general framework of Language-Conditioned Graph Networks (LCGN), where each node represents an object, and is described by a context-aware representation from related objects through iterative message passing conditioned on the textual input. E.g., conditioning on the ``on'' relationship to the plate, the object ``mug'' gathers messages from the object ``plate'' to update its representation to ``mug on the plate'', which can be easily consumed by a simple classifier for answer prediction. We experimentally show that our LCGN approach effectively supports relational reasoning and improves performance across several tasks and datasets. 
### 52.Ink removal from histopathology whole slide images by combining classification, detection and image generation models  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04385.pdf)
>  Histopathology slides are routinely marked by pathologists using permanent ink markers that should not be removed as they form part of the medical record. Often tumour regions are marked up for the purpose of highlighting features or other downstream processing such an gene sequencing. Once digitised there is no established method for removing this information from the whole slide images limiting its usability in research and study. Removal of marker ink from these high-resolution whole slide images is non-trivial and complex problem as they contaminate different regions and in an inconsistent manner. We propose an efficient pipeline using convolution neural networks that results in ink-free images without compromising information and image resolution. Our pipeline includes a sequential classical convolution neural network for accurate classification of contaminated image tiles, a fast region detector and a domain adaptive cycle consistent adversarial generative model for restoration of foreground pixels. Both quantitative and qualitative results on four different whole slide images show that our approach yields visually coherent ink-free whole slide images. 
### 53.Efficient video indexing for monitoring disease activity and progression in the upper gastrointestinal tract  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04384.pdf)
>  Endoscopy is a routine imaging technique used for both diagnosis and minimally invasive surgical treatment. While the endoscopy video contains a wealth of information, tools to capture this information for the purpose of clinical reporting are rather poor. In date, endoscopists do not have any access to tools that enable them to browse the video data in an efficient and user friendly manner. Fast and reliable video retrieval methods could for example, allow them to review data from previous exams and therefore improve their ability to monitor disease progression. Deep learning provides new avenues of compressing and indexing video in an extremely efficient manner. In this study, we propose to use an autoencoder for efficient video compression and fast retrieval of video images. To boost the accuracy of video image retrieval and to address data variability like multi-modality and view-point changes, we propose the integration of a Siamese network. We demonstrate that our approach is competitive in retrieving images from 3 large scale videos of 3 different patients obtained against the query samples of their previous diagnosis. Quantitative validation shows that the combined approach yield an overall improvement of 5% and 8% over classical and variational autoencoders, respectively. 
### 54.FastDraw: Addressing the Long Tail of Lane Detection by Adapting a Sequential Prediction Network  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04354.pdf)
>  The search for predictive models that generalize to the long tail of sensor inputs is the central difficulty when developing data-driven models for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we use lane detection to study modeling and training techniques that yield better performance on real world test drives. On the modeling side, we introduce a novel fully convolutional model of lane detection that learns to decode lane structures instead of delegating structure inference to post-processing. In contrast to previous works, our convolutional decoder is able to represent an arbitrary number of lanes per image, preserves the polyline representation of lanes without reducing lanes to polynomials, and draws lanes iteratively without requiring the computational and temporal complexity of recurrent neural networks. Because our model includes an estimate of the joint distribution of neighboring pixels belonging to the same lane, our formulation includes a natural and computationally cheap definition of uncertainty. On the training side, we demonstrate a simple yet effective approach to adapt the model to new environments using unsupervised style transfer. By training FastDraw to make predictions of lane structure that are invariant to low-level stylistic differences between images, we achieve strong performance at test time in weather and lighting conditions that deviate substantially from those of the annotated datasets that are publicly available. We quantitatively evaluate our approach on the CVPR 2017 Tusimple lane marking challenge, difficult CULane datasets, and a small labeled dataset of our own and achieve competitive accuracy while running at 90 FPS. 
### 55.Differential Recurrent Neural Network and its Application for Human Activity Recognition  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04293.pdf)
>  The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is capable of processing complex sequential information since it utilizes special gating schemes for learning representations from long input sequences. It has the potential to model any sequential time-series data, where the current hidden state has to be considered in the context of the past hidden states. This property makes LSTM an ideal choice to learn the complex dynamics present in long sequences. Unfortunately, the conventional LSTMs do not consider the impact of spatio-temporal dynamics corresponding to the given salient motion patterns, when they gate the information that ought to be memorized through time. To address this problem, we propose a differential gating scheme for the LSTM neural network, which emphasizes on the change in information gain caused by the salient motions between the successive video frames. This change in information gain is quantified by Derivative of States (DoS), and thus the proposed LSTM model is termed as differential Recurrent Neural Network (dRNN). In addition, the original work used the hidden state at the last time-step to model the entire video sequence. Based on the energy profiling of DoS, we further propose to employ the State Energy Profile (SEP) to search for salient dRNN states and construct more informative representations. The effectiveness of the proposed model was demonstrated by automatically recognizing human actions from the real-world 2D and 3D single-person action datasets. We point out that LSTM is a special form of dRNN. As a result, we have introduced a new family of LSTMs. Our study is one of the first works towards demonstrating the potential of learning complex time-series representations via high-order derivatives of states. 
### 56.Implicit Filter Sparsification In Convolutional Neural Networks  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04967.pdf)
>  We show implicit filter level sparsity manifests in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which employ Batch Normalization and ReLU activation, and are trained with adaptive gradient descent techniques and L2 regularization or weight decay. Through an extensive empirical study (Mehta et al., 2019) we hypothesize the mechanism behind the sparsification process, and find surprising links to certain filter sparsification heuristics proposed in literature. Emergence of, and the subsequent pruning of selective features is observed to be one of the contributing mechanisms, leading to feature sparsity at par or better than certain explicit sparsification / pruning approaches. In this workshop article we summarize our findings, and point out corollaries of selective-featurepenalization which could also be employed as heuristics for filter pruning 
### 57.Automatic Calibration of Multiple 3D LiDARs in Urban Environments  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04912.pdf)
>  Multiple LiDARs have progressively emerged on autonomous vehicles for rendering a wide field of view and dense measurements. However, the lack of precise calibration negatively affects their potential applications in localization and perception systems. In this paper, we propose a novel system that enables automatic multi-LiDAR calibration without any calibration target, prior environmental information, and initial values of the extrinsic parameters. Our approach starts with a hand-eye calibration for automatic initialization by aligning the estimated motions of each sensor. The resulting parameters are then refined with an appearance-based method by minimizing a cost function constructed from point-plane correspondences. Experimental results on simulated and real-world data sets demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of our calibration approach. The proposed approach can calibrate a multi-LiDAR system with the rotation and translation errors less than 0.04 [rad] and 0.1 [m] respectively for a mobile platform. 
### 58.ISBNet: Instance-aware Selective Branching Network  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04849.pdf)
>  Recent years have witnessed growing interests in designing efficient neural networks and neural architecture search (NAS). Although remarkable efficiency and accuracy have been achieved, existing expert designed and NAS models neglect that input instances are of varying complexity thus different amount of computation is required. Therefore, inference with a fixed model that processes all instances through the same transformations would waste plenty of computational resources. Customizing the model capacity in an instance-aware manner is highly demanded. In this paper, we introduce a novel network ISBNet to address this issue, which supports efficient instance-level inference by selectively bypassing transformation branches of infinitesimal importance weight. We also propose lightweight hypernetworks SelectionNet to generate these importance weights instance-wisely. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of ISBNet and the results show that ISBNet achieves extremely efficient inference comparing to existing networks. For example, ISBNet takes only 12.45% parameters and 45.79% FLOPs of the state-of-the-art efficient network ShuffleNetV2 with comparable accuracy. 
### 59.Multi-Agent Image Classification via Reinforcement Learning  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04835.pdf)
>  We investigate a classification problem using multiple mobile agents that are capable of collecting (partial) pose-dependent observations of an unknown environment. The objective is to classify an image (e.g, map of a large area) over a finite time horizon. We propose a network architecture on how agents should form a local belief, take local actions, extract relevant features and specification from their raw partial observations. Agents are allowed to exchange information with their neighboring agents and run a decentralized consensus protocol to update their own beliefs. It is shown how reinforcement learning techniques can be utilized to achieve decentralized implementation of the classification problem. Our experimental results on MNIST handwritten digit dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework. 
### 60.Programmable Spectrometry -- Per-pixel Classification of Materials using Learned Spectral Filters  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04815.pdf)
>  Many materials have distinct spectral profiles. This facilitates estimation of the material composition of a scene at each pixel by first acquiring its hyperspectral image, and subsequently filtering it using a bank of spectral profiles. This process is inherently wasteful since only a set of linear projections of the acquired measurements contribute to the classification task. We propose a novel programmable camera that is capable of producing images of a scene with an arbitrary spectral filter. We use this camera to optically implement the spectral filtering of the scene's hyperspectral image with the bank of spectral profiles needed to perform per-pixel material classification. This provides gains both in terms of acquisition speed --- since only the relevant measurements are acquired --- and in signal-to-noise ratio --- since we invariably avoid narrowband filters that are light inefficient. Given training data, we use a range of classical and modern techniques including SVMs and neural networks to identify the bank of spectral profiles that facilitate material classification. We verify the method in simulations on standard datasets as well as real data using a lab prototype of the camera. 
### 61.Approximated Oracle Filter Pruning for Destructive CNN Width Optimization  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04748.pdf)
>  It is not easy to design and run Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to: 1) finding the optimal number of filters (i.e., the width) at each layer is tricky, given an architecture; and 2) the computational intensity of CNNs impedes the deployment on computationally limited devices. Oracle Pruning is designed to remove the unimportant filters from a well-trained CNN, which estimates the filters' importance by ablating them in turn and evaluating the model, thus delivers high accuracy but suffers from intolerable time complexity, and requires a given resulting width but cannot automatically find it. To address these problems, we propose Approximated Oracle Filter Pruning (AOFP), which keeps searching for the least important filters in a binary search manner, makes pruning attempts by masking out filters randomly, accumulates the resulting errors, and finetunes the model via a multi-path framework. As AOFP enables simultaneous pruning on multiple layers, we can prune an existing very deep CNN with acceptable time cost, negligible accuracy drop, and no heuristic knowledge, or re-design a model which exerts higher accuracy and faster inference. 
### 62.Flat Metric Minimization with Applications in Generative Modeling  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04730.pdf)
>  We take the novel perspective to view data not as a probability distribution but rather as a current. Primarily studied in the field of geometric measure theory, $k$-currents are continuous linear functionals acting on compactly supported smooth differential forms and can be understood as a generalized notion of oriented $k$-dimensional manifold. By moving from distributions (which are $0$-currents) to $k$-currents, we can explicitly orient the data by attaching a $k$-dimensional tangent plane to each sample point. Based on the flat metric which is a fundamental distance between currents, we derive FlatGAN, a formulation in the spirit of generative adversarial networks but generalized to $k$-currents. In our theoretical contribution we prove that the flat metric between a parametrized current and a reference current is Lipschitz continuous in the parameters. In experiments, we show that the proposed shift to $k&gt;0$ leads to interpretable and disentangled latent representations which behave equivariantly to the specified oriented tangent planes. 
### 63.Style transfer based data augmentation in material microscopic image processing  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04711.pdf)
>  Recently progress in material microscopic image semantic segmentation has been driven by high-capacity models trained on large datasets. However, collecting microscopic images with pixel-level labels has been extremely costly due to the amount of human effort required. In this paper, we present an approach to rapidly creating microscopic images with pixel-level labels from material 3d simulated models. Usually images extracted directly from those 3d simulated models are not realistic enough. It is easy to get semantic labels, though. We introduce style transfer technique to make simulated image data more similar to real microscopic data. We validate the presented approach by using real image data from experiment and simulated image data from Monte Carlo Potts Models, which simulate the growth of polycrystal. Experiments show that using the acquired simulated image data and style transfer technique to supplement real images of polycrystalline iron significantly improves the mean precision of image processing. Besides, models trained with simulated image data and just 1/3 of the real data outperform models trained on the complete real image data. In the study of such polycrystalline materials, this approach can reduce pressure of getting and labeling images from microscopes. Also, it can be applied to numbers of other material images. 
### 64.Learning to Convolve: A Generalized Weight-Tying Approach  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04663.pdf)
>  Recent work (Cohen &amp; Welling, 2016) has shown that generalizations of convolutions, based on group theory, provide powerful inductive biases for learning. In these generalizations, filters are not only translated but can also be rotated, flipped, etc. However, coming up with exact models of how to rotate a 3 x 3 filter on a square pixel-grid is difficult. In this paper, we learn how to transform filters for use in the group convolution, focussing on roto-translation. For this, we learn a filter basis and all rotated versions of that filter basis. Filters are then encoded by a set of rotation invariant coefficients. To rotate a filter, we switch the basis. We demonstrate we can produce feature maps with low sensitivity to input rotations, while achieving high performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10. 
### 65.Generative Adversarial Networks and Conditional Random Fields for Hyperspectral Image Classification  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04621.pdf)
>  In this paper, we address the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification task with a generative adversarial network and conditional random field (GAN-CRF) -based framework, which integrates a semi-supervised deep learning and a probabilistic graphical model, and make three contributions. First, we design four types of convolutional and transposed convolutional layers that consider the characteristics of HSIs to help with extracting discriminative features from limited numbers of labeled HSI samples. Second, we construct semi-supervised GANs to alleviate the shortage of training samples by adding labels to them and implicitly reconstructing real HSI data distribution through adversarial training. Third, we build dense conditional random fields (CRFs) on top of the random variables that are initialized to the softmax predictions of the trained GANs and are conditioned on HSIs to refine classification maps. This semi-supervised framework leverages the merits of discriminative and generative models through a game-theoretical approach. Moreover, even though we used very small numbers of labeled training HSI samples from the two most challenging and extensively studied datasets, the experimental results demonstrated that spectral-spatial GAN-CRF (SS-GAN-CRF) models achieved top-ranking accuracy for semi-supervised HSI classification. 
### 66.Training CNNs with Selective Allocation of Channels  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04509.pdf)
>  Recent progress in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled a simple paradigm of architecture design: larger models typically achieve better accuracy. Due to this, in modern CNN architectures, it becomes more important to design models that generalize well under certain resource constraints, e.g. the number of parameters. In this paper, we propose a simple way to improve the capacity of any CNN model having large-scale features, without adding more parameters. In particular, we modify a standard convolutional layer to have a new functionality of channel-selectivity, so that the layer is trained to select important channels to re-distribute their parameters. Our experimental results under various CNN architectures and datasets demonstrate that the proposed new convolutional layer allows new optima that generalize better via efficient resource utilization, compared to the baseline. 
### 67.Learning Robotic Manipulation through Visual Planning and Acting  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04411.pdf)
>  Planning for robotic manipulation requires reasoning about the changes a robot can affect on objects. When such interactions can be modelled analytically, as in domains with rigid objects, efficient planning algorithms exist. However, in both domestic and industrial domains, the objects of interest can be soft, or deformable, and hard to model analytically. For such cases, we posit that a data-driven modelling approach is more suitable. In recent years, progress in deep generative models has produced methods that learn to `imagine' plausible images from data. Building on the recent Causal InfoGAN generative model, in this work we learn to imagine goal-directed object manipulation directly from raw image data of self-supervised interaction of the robot with the object. After learning, given a goal observation of the system, our model can generate an imagined plan -- a sequence of images that transition the object into the desired goal. To execute the plan, we use it as a reference trajectory to track with a visual servoing controller, which we also learn from the data as an inverse dynamics model. In a simulated manipulation task, we show that separating the problem into visual planning and visual tracking control is more sample efficient and more interpretable than alternative data-driven approaches. We further demonstrate our approach on learning to imagine and execute in 3 environments, the final of which is deformable rope manipulation on a PR2 robot. 
### 68.Few-Shot Learning with Embedded Class Models and Shot-Free Meta Training  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04398.pdf)
>  We propose a method for learning embeddings for few-shot learning that is suitable for use with any number of ways and any number of shots (shot-free). Rather than fixing the class prototypes to be the Euclidean average of sample embeddings, we allow them to live in a higher-dimensional space (embedded class models) and learn the prototypes along with the model parameters. The class representation function is defined implicitly, which allows us to deal with a variable number of shots per each class with a simple constant-size architecture. The class embedding encompasses metric learning, that facilitates adding new classes without crowding the class representation space. Despite being general and not tuned to the benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the standard few-shot benchmark datasets. 
### 69.Large-Scale Spectrum Occupancy Learning via Tensor Decomposition and LSTM Networks  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04392.pdf)
>  A new paradigm for large-scale spectrum occupancy learning based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks is proposed. Studies have shown that spectrum usage is a highly correlated time series. Moreover, there is a correlation for occupancy of spectrum between different frequency channels. Therefore, revealing all these correlations using learning and prediction of one-dimensional time series is not a trivial task. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for representing the spectrum measurements in a tensor format. Next, a time-series prediction method based on CANDECOMP/PARFAC (CP) tensor decomposition and LSTM recurrent neural networks is proposed. The proposed method is computationally efficient and is able to capture different types of correlation within the measured spectrum. Moreover, it is robust against noise and missing entries of sensed spectrum. The superiority of the proposed method is evaluated over a large-scale synthetic dataset in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. 
### 70.Digital Passport: A Novel Technological Strategy for Intellectual Property Protection of Convolutional Neural Networks  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04368.pdf)
>  In order to prevent deep neural networks from being infringed by unauthorized parties, we propose a generic solution which embeds a designated digital passport into a network, and subsequently, either paralyzes the network functionalities for unauthorized usages or maintain its functionalities in the presence of a verified passport. Such a desired network behavior is successfully demonstrated in a number of implementation schemes, which provide reliable, preventive and timely protections against tens of thousands of fake-passport deceptions. Extensive experiments also show that the deep neural network performance under unauthorized usages deteriorate significantly (e.g. with 33% to 82% reductions of CIFAR10 classification accuracies), while networks endorsed with valid passports remain intact. 
### 71.Analysis of Probabilistic multi-scale fractional order fusion-based de-hazing algorithm  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04302.pdf)
>  In this report, a de-hazing algorithm based on probability and multi-scale fractional order-based fusion is proposed. The proposed scheme improves on a previously implemented multiscale fraction order-based fusion by augmenting its local contrast and edge sharpening features. It also brightens de-hazed images, while avoiding sky region over-enhancement. The results of the proposed algorithm are analyzed and compared with existing methods from the literature and indicate better performance in most cases.
