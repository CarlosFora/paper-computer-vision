### 1.S-DOD-CNN: Doubly Injecting Spatially-Preserved Object Information for Event Recognition  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04051.pdf)
>  We present a novel event recognition approach called Spatially-preserved Doubly-injected Object Detection CNN (S-DOD-CNN), which incorporates the spatially preserved object detection information in both a direct and an indirect way. Indirect injection is carried out by simply sharing the weights between the object detection modules and the event recognition module. Meanwhile, our novelty lies in the fact that we have preserved the spatial information for the direct injection. Once multiple regions-of-intereset (RoIs) are acquired, their feature maps are computed and then projected onto a spatially-preserving combined feature map using one of the four RoI Projection approaches we present. In our architecture, combined feature maps are generated for object detection which are directly injected to the event recognition module. Our method provides the state-of-the-art accuracy for malicious event recognition. 
### 2.MultiResUNet : Rethinking the U-Net Architecture for Multimodal Biomedical Image Segmentation  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04049.pdf)
>  In recent years Deep Learning has brought about a breakthrough in Medical Image Segmentation. U-Net is the most prominent deep network in this regard, which has been the most popular architecture in the medical imaging community. Despite outstanding overall performance in segmenting multimodal medical images, from extensive experimentations on challenging datasets, we found out that the classical U-Net architecture seems to be lacking in certain aspects. Therefore, we propose some modifications to improve upon the already state-of-the-art U-Net model. Hence, following the modifications we develop a novel architecture MultiResUNet as the potential successor to the successful U-Net architecture. We have compared our proposed architecture MultiResUNet with the classical U-Net on a vast repertoire of multimodal medical images. Albeit slight improvements in the cases of ideal images, a remarkable gain in performance has been attained for challenging images. We have evaluated our model on five different datasets, each with their own unique challenges, and have obtained a relative improvement in performance of 10.15%, 5.07%, 2.63%, 1.41%, and 0.62% respectively. 
### 3.Registration-free Face-SSD: Single shot analysis of smiles, facial attributes, and affect in the wild  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04042.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a novel single shot face-related task analysis method, called Face-SSD, for detecting faces and for performing various face-related (classification/regression) tasks including smile recognition, face attribute prediction and valence-arousal estimation in the wild. Face-SSD uses a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) to detect multiple faces of different sizes and recognise/regress one or more face-related classes. Face-SSD has two parallel branches that share the same low-level filters, one branch dealing with face detection and the other one with face analysis tasks. The outputs of both branches are spatially aligned heatmaps that are produced in parallel - therefore Face-SSD does not require that face detection, facial region extraction, size normalisation, and facial region processing are performed in subsequent steps. Our contributions are threefold: 1) Face-SSD is the first network to perform face analysis without relying on pre-processing such as face detection and registration in advance - Face-SSD is a simple and a single FCNN architecture simultaneously performing face detection and face-related task analysis - those are conventionally treated as separate consecutive tasks; 2) Face-SSD is a generalised architecture that is applicable for various face analysis tasks without modifying the network structure - this is in contrast to designing task-specific architectures; and 3) Face-SSD achieves real-time performance (21 FPS) even when detecting multiple faces and recognising multiple classes in a given image. Experimental results show that Face-SSD achieves state-of-the-art performance in various face analysis tasks by reaching a recognition accuracy of 95.76% for smile detection, 90.29% for attribute prediction, and Root Mean Square (RMS) error of 0.44 and 0.39 for valence and arousal estimation. 
### 4.Deep Learning Methods for Event Verification and Image Repurposing Detection  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04038.pdf)
>  The authenticity of images posted on social media is an issue of growing concern. Many algorithms have been developed to detect manipulated images, but few have investigated the ability of deep neural network based approaches to verify the authenticity of image labels, such as event names. In this paper, we propose several novel methods to predict if an image was captured at one of several noteworthy events. We use a set of images from several recorded events such as storms, marathons, protests, and other large public gatherings. Two strategies of applying pre-trained Imagenet network for event verification are presented, with two modifications for each strategy. The first method uses the features from the last convolutional layer of a pre-trained network as input to a classifier. We also consider the effects of tuning the convolutional weights of the pre-trained network to improve classification. The second method combines many features extracted from smaller scales and uses the output of a pre-trained network as the input to a second classifier. For both methods, we investigated several different classifiers and tested many different pre-trained networks. Our experiments demonstrate both these approaches are effective for event verification and image re-purposing detection. The classification at the global scale tends to marginally outperform our tested local methods and fine tuning the network further improves the results. 
### 5.Color Image and Multispectral Image Denoising Using Block Diagonal Representation  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03954.pdf)
>  Filtering images of more than one channel is challenging in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. By grouping similar patches to utilize the self-similarity and sparse linear approximation of natural images, recent nonlocal and transform-domain methods have been widely used in color and multispectral image (MSI) denoising. Many related methods focus on the modeling of group level correlation to enhance sparsity, which often resorts to a recursive strategy with a large number of similar patches. The importance of the patch level representation is understated. In this paper, we mainly investigate the influence and potential of representation at patch level by considering a general formulation with block diagonal matrix. We further show that by training a proper global patch basis, along with a local principal component analysis transform in the grouping dimension, a simple transform-threshold-inverse method could produce very competitive results. Fast implementation is also developed to reduce computational complexity. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness and efficiency. 
### 6.MISO: Mutual Information Loss with Stochastic Style Representations for Multimodal Image-to-Image Translation  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03938.pdf)
>  Unpaired multimodal image-to-image translation is a task of translating a given image in a source domain into diverse images in the target domain, overcoming the limitation of one-to-one mapping. Existing multimodal translation models are mainly based on the disentangled representations with an image reconstruction loss. We propose two approaches to improve multimodal translation quality. First, we use a content representation from the source domain conditioned on a style representation from the target domain. Second, rather than using a typical image reconstruction loss, we design MILO (Mutual Information LOss), a new stochastically-defined loss function based on information theory. This loss function directly reflects the interpretation of latent variables as a random variable. We show that our proposed model Mutual Information with StOchastic Style Representation(MISO) achieves state-of-the-art performance through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets. 
### 7.Robust statistics and no-reference image quality assessment in Curvelet domain  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03842.pdf)
>  This paper uses robust statistics and curvelet transform to learn a general-purpose no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) model. The new approach, here called M1, competes with the Curvelet Quality Assessment proposed in 2014 (Curvelet2014). The central idea is to use descriptors based on robust statistics to extract features and predict the human opinion about degraded images. To show the consistency of the method the model is tested with 3 different datasets, LIVE IQA, TID2013 and CSIQ. To test evaluation, it is used the Wilcoxon test to verify the statistical significance of results and promote an accurate comparison between new model M1 and Curvelet2014. The results show a gain when robust statistics are used as descriptor. 
### 8.Semantic Hierarchical Priors for Intrinsic Image Decomposition  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03830.pdf)
>  Intrinsic Image Decomposition (IID) is a challenging and interesting computer vision problem with various applications in several fields. We present novel semantic priors and an integrated approach for single image IID that involves analyzing image at three hierarchical context levels. Local context priors capture scene properties at each pixel within a small neighbourhood. Mid-level context priors encode object level semantics. Global context priors establish correspondences at the scene level. Our semantic priors are designed on both fixed and flexible regions, using selective search method and Convolutional Neural Network features. Our IID method is an iterative multistage optimization scheme and consists of two complementary formulations: $L_2$ smoothing for shading and $L_1$ sparsity for reflectance. Experiments and analysis of our method indicate the utility of our semantic priors and structured hierarchical analysis in an IID framework. We compare our method with other contemporary IID solutions and show results with lesser artifacts. Finally, we highlight that proper choice and encoding of prior knowledge can produce competitive results even when compared to end-to-end deep learning IID methods, signifying the importance of such priors. We believe that the insights and techniques presented in this paper would be useful in the future IID research. 
### 9.GET-AID: Visual Recognition of Human Rights Abuses via Global Emotional Traits  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03817.pdf)
>  In the era of social media and big data, the use of visual evidence to document conflict and human rights abuse has become an important element for human rights organizations and advocates. In this paper, we address the task of detecting two types of human rights abuses in challenging, everyday photos: (1) child labour, and (2) displaced populations. We propose a novel model that is driven by a human-centric approach. Our hypothesis is that the emotional state of a person -- how positive or pleasant an emotion is, and the control level of the situation by the person -- are powerful cues for perceiving potential human rights violations. To exploit these cues, our model learns to predict global emotional traits over a given image based on the joint analysis of every detected person and the whole scene. By integrating these predictions with a data-driven convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, our system efficiently infers potential human rights abuses in a clean, end-to-end system we call GET-AID (from Global Emotional Traits for Abuse IDentification). Extensive experiments are performed to verify our method on the recently introduced subset of Human Rights Archive (HRA) dataset (2 violation categories with the same number of positive and negative samples), where we show quantitatively compelling results. Compared with previous works and the sole use of a CNN classifier, this paper improves the coverage up to 23.73% for child labour and 57.21% for displaced populations. Our dataset, codes and trained models are available online at <a href="https://github.com/GKalliatakis/GET-AID">this https URL</a>. 
### 10.Additional Baseline Metrics for the paper &#34;Extended YouTube Faces: a Dataset for Heterogeneous Open-Set Face Identification&#34;  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03804.pdf)
>  In this report, we provide additional and corrected results for the paper &#34;Extended YouTube Faces: a Dataset for Heterogeneous Open-Set Face Identification&#34;. After further investigations, we discovered and corrected wrongly labeled images and incorrect identities. This forced us to re-generate the evaluation protocol for the new data; in doing so, we also reproduced and extended the experimental results with other standard metrics and measures used in the literature. The reader can refer to the original paper for additional details regarding the data collection procedure and recognition pipeline. 
### 11.A Motion Free Approach to Dense Depth Estimation in Complex Dynamic Scene  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03791.pdf)
>  Despite the recent success in per-frame monocular dense depth estimation of rigid scenes using deep learning methods, they fail to achieve similar success for complex dynamic scenes, such as MPI Sintel \cite{butler2012naturalistic}. Moreover, conventional geometric methods to address this problem using a piece-wise rigid scene model requires a reliable estimation of motion parameters for each local model, which is difficult to obtain and validate. In this work, we show that, given per-pixel optical flow correspondences between two consecutive frames and the sparse depth prior for the reference frame, we can recover the dense depth map for the successive frames without solving for motion parameters. By assigning the locally rigid structure to the piece-wise planar approximation of a dynamic scene which transforms as rigid as possible over frames, we demonstrate that we can bypass the motion estimation step. In essence, our formulation provides a new way to think and recover dense depth map of a complex dynamic scene which is recursive, incremental and motion free in nature and therefore, it can also be integrated with the modern neural network frameworks for large-scale depth-estimation applications. Our proposed method does not make any prior assumption about the rigidity of a dynamic scene, as a result, it is applicable to a wide range of scenarios. Experimental results show that our method can effectively provide the depth for the successive/multiple frames of a dynamic scene without using any motion parameters. 
### 12.Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation with Domain Supervision  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03782.pdf)
>  Image-to-image translation has been widely investigated in recent years. Existing approaches are elaborately designed in an unsupervised manner and little attention has been paid to domain information beneath unpaired data. In this work, we treat domain information as explicit supervision and design an unpaired image-to-image translation framework, Domain-supervised GAN (briefly, DosGAN), that takes the first step towards exploration of domain supervision. Instead of representing domain characteristics with different generators in CycleGAN\cite{zhu2017unpaired} or multiple domain codes in StarGAN~\cite{choi2017stargan}, we pre-train a classification network to classify the domain of an image. After pre-training, this network is used to extract domain features of each image by using the output of its second-to-last layer. Such features, together with the latent semantic features extracted by another encoder (shared across different domains), are used to generate an image in the target domain. Experiments on multiple hair color translation, multiple identity translation and conditional edges-to-shoes/handbags demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In addition, we transfer the domain feature extractor obtained on the Facescrub dataset with domain supervision information, to the CelebA dataset without domain supervision information, and succeed achieving conditional translation with any two images in CelebA, while previous models like StarGAN cannot handle this task. Our code is available at \url{<a href="https://github.com/linjx-ustc1106/DosGAN-PyTorch">this https URL</a>}. 
### 13.Pornographic Image Recognition via Weighted Multiple Instance Learning  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03771.pdf)
>  In the era of Internet, recognizing pornographic images is of great significance for protecting children&#39;s physical and mental health. However, this task is very challenging as the key pornographic contents (e.g., breast and private part) in an image often lie in local regions of small size. In this paper, we model each image as a bag of regions, and follow a multiple instance learning (MIL) approach to train a generic region-based recognition model. Specifically, we take into account the region&#39;s degree of pornography, and make three main contributions. First, we show that based on very few annotations of the key pornographic contents in a training image, we can generate a bag of properly sized regions, among which the potential positive regions usually contain useful contexts that can aid recognition. Second, we present a simple quantitative measure of a region&#39;s degree of pornography, which can be used to weigh the importance of different regions in a positive image. Third, we formulate the recognition task as a weighted MIL problem under the convolutional neural network framework, with a bag probability function introduced to combine the importance of different regions. Experiments on our newly collected large scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an accuracy with 97.52% true positive rate at 1% false positive rate, tested on 100K pornographic images and 100K normal images. 
### 14.Taking a HINT: Leveraging Explanations to Make Vision and Language Models More Grounded  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03751.pdf)
>  Many vision and language models suffer from poor visual grounding - often falling back on easy-to-learn language priors rather than associating language with visual concepts. In this work, we propose a generic framework which we call Human Importance-aware Network Tuning (HINT) that effectively leverages human supervision to improve visual grounding. HINT constrains deep networks to be sensitive to the same input regions as humans. Crucially, our approach optimizes the alignment between human attention maps and gradient-based network importances - ensuring that models learn not just to look at but rather rely on visual concepts that humans found relevant for a task when making predictions. We demonstrate our approach on Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning tasks, achieving state of-the-art for the VQA-CP dataset which penalizes over-reliance on language priors. 
### 15.Peeking into the Future: Predicting Future Person Activities and Locations in Videos  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03748.pdf)
>  Deciphering human behaviors to predict their future paths/trajectories and what they would do from videos is important in many applications. Motivated by this idea, this paper studies predicting a pedestrian&#39;s future path jointly with future activities. We propose an end-to-end, multi-task learning system utilizing rich visual features about the human behavioral information and interaction with their surroundings. To facilitate the training, the network is learned with two auxiliary tasks of predicting future activities and the location in which the activity will happen. Experimental results demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance over two public benchmarks on future trajectory prediction. Moreover, our method is able to produce meaningful future activity prediction in addition to the path. The result provides the first empirical evidence that a joint modeling of paths and activities benefits future path prediction. 
### 16.Visual SLAM: Why Bundle Adjust?  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03747.pdf)
>  Bundle adjustment plays a vital role in feature-based monocular SLAM. In many modern SLAM pipelines, bundle adjustment is performed to estimate the 6DOF camera trajectory and 3D map (3D point cloud) from the input feature tracks. However, two fundamental weaknesses plague SLAM systems based on bundle adjustment. First, the need to carefully initialise bundle adjustment means that all variables, in particular the map, must be estimated as accurately as possible and maintained over time, which makes the overall algorithm cumbersome. Second, since estimating the 3D structure (which requires sufficient baseline) is inherent in bundle adjustment, the SLAM algorithm will encounter difficulties during periods of slow motion or pure rotational motion. <br />We propose a different SLAM optimisation core: instead of bundle adjustment, we conduct rotation averaging to incrementally optimise only camera orientations. Given the orientations, we estimate the camera positions and 3D points via a quasi-convex formulation that can be solved efficiently and globally optimally. Our approach not only obviates the need to estimate and maintain the positions and 3D map at keyframe rate (which enables simpler SLAM systems), it is also more capable of handling slow motions or pure rotational motions. 
### 17.UcoSLAM: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping by Fusion of KeyPoints and Squared Planar Markers  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03729.pdf)
>  This paper proposes a novel approach for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping by fusing natural and artificial landmarks. Most of the SLAM approaches use natural landmarks (such as keypoints). However, they are unstable over time, repetitive in many cases or insufficient for a robust tracking (e.g. in indoor buildings). On the other hand, other approaches have employed artificial landmarks (such as squared fiducial markers) placed in the environment to help tracking and relocalization. We propose a method that integrates both approaches in order to achieve long-term robust tracking in many scenarios. <br />Our method has been compared to the start-of-the-art methods ORB-SLAM2 and LDSO in the public dataset Kitti, Euroc-MAV, TUM and SPM, obtaining better precision, robustness and speed. Our tests also show that the combination of markers and keypoints achieves better accuracy than each one of them independently. 
### 18.Towards Segmenting Everything That Moves  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03715.pdf)
>  Video analysis is the task of perceiving the world as it changes. Often, though, most of the world doesn&#39;t change all that much: it&#39;s boring. For many applications such as action detection or robotic interaction, segmenting all moving objects is a crucial first step. While this problem has been well-studied in the field of spatiotemporal segmentation, virtually none of the prior works use learning-based approaches, despite significant advances in single-frame instance segmentation. We propose the first deep-learning based approach for video instance segmentation. Our two-stream models&#39; architecture is based on Mask R-CNN, but additionally takes optical flow as input to identify moving objects. It then combines the motion and appearance cues to correct motion estimation mistakes and capture the full extent of objects. We show state-of-the-art results on the Freiburg Berkeley Motion Segmentation dataset by a wide margin. One potential worry with learning-based methods is that they might overfit to the particular type of objects that they have been trained on. While current recognition systems tend to be limited to a &#34;closed world&#34; of N objects on which they are trained, our model seems to segment almost anything that moves. 
### 19.Context-Aware Visual Compatibility Prediction  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03646.pdf)
>  How do we determine whether two or more clothing items are compatible or visually appealing? Part of the answer lies in understanding of visual aesthetics, and is biased by personal preferences shaped by social attitudes, time, and place. In this work we propose a method that predicts compatibility between two items based on their visual features, as well as their context. We define context as the products that are known to be compatible with each of these item. Our model is in contrast to other metric learning approaches that rely on pairwise comparisons between item features alone. We address the compatibility prediction problem using a graph neural network that learns to generate product embeddings conditioned on their context. We present results for two prediction tasks (fill in the blank and outfit compatibility) tested on two fashion datasets Polyvore and Fashion-Gen, and on a subset of the Amazon dataset; we achieve state of the art results when using context information and show how test performance improves as more context is used. 
### 20.A Shallow Triple Stream Three-dimensional CNN (STSTNet) for Micro-expression Recognition System  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03634.pdf)
>  In the recent year, the state-of-the-arts of facial micro-expression recognition task have been significantly advanced by the emergence of data-driven approaches based on deep learning. Due to the superb learning capacity of deep learning, it generates promising performance beyond the traditional handcrafted approaches. Recently, many researchers have focused on developing better networks by increasing its depth, as deep networks can effectively approximate certain function classes more efficiently than shallow ones. In this paper, we aim to design a shallow network to extract the high level features of the micro-expression details. Specifically, a two-layer neural network, namely Shallow Triple Stream Three-dimensional CNN (STSTNet) is proposed. The network is capable to learn the features from three optical flow features (i.e., optical strain, horizontal and vertical optical flow images) computed from the onset and apex frames from each video. Our experimental results demonstrate the viability of the proposed STSTNet, which exhibits the UAR recognition results of 76.05%, 70.13%, 86.86% and 68.10% in composite, SMIC, CASME II and SAMM databases, respectively. 
### 21.A Generative 3D Facial Model by Adversarial Training  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03619.pdf)
>  We consider data-driven generative models for the 3D face, and focus in particular on factorized representations that can decouple sources of variation, typically identity and expression with faces. Such models provide semantically meaningful parameterizations, but existing methods are still limited in their ability to effectively learn the variability with respect to natural factors, especially when only sparse label information is available. In this work we explore a new direction for this problem by using Generative Adversarial Networks. We build in particular on auxiliary classifier GANs to design a model that maps 3D face shapes into a latent space where identity and expression attributes are explicitly disentangled. Our experiments demonstrate that GANs can contribute with better decoupling performances while achieving competitive model accuracy. 
### 22.Towards Automatic Lesion Classification in the Upper Aerodigestive Tract Using OCT and Deep Transfer Learning Methods  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03618.pdf)
>  Early detection of cancer is crucial for treatment and overall patient survival. In the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) the gold standard for identification of malignant tissue is an invasive biopsy. Recently, non-invasive imaging techniques such as confocal laser microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used for tissue assessment. In particular, in a recent study experts classified lesions in the UADT with respect to their invasiveness using OCT images only. As the results were promising, automatic classification of lesions might be feasible which could assist experts in their decision making. Therefore, we address the problem of automatic lesion classification from OCT images. This task is very challenging as the available dataset is extremely small and the data quality is limited. However, as similar issues are typical in many clinical scenarios we study to what extent deep learning approaches can still be trained and used for decision support. 
### 23.MOTS: Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03604.pdf)
>  This paper extends the popular task of multi-object tracking to multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS). Towards this goal, we create dense pixel-level annotations for two existing tracking datasets using a semi-automatic annotation procedure. Our new annotations comprise 70,430 pixel masks for 1,084 distinct objects (cars and pedestrians) in 10,870 video frames. For evaluation, we extend existing multi-object tracking metrics to this new task. Moreover, we propose a new baseline method which jointly addresses detection, tracking, and segmentation with a single convolutional network. We demonstrate the value of our datasets by achieving improvements in performance when training on MOTS annotations. We believe that our datasets, metrics and baseline will become a valuable resource towards developing multi-object tracking approaches that go beyond 2D bounding boxes. 
### 24.Vulnerable road user detection: state-of-the-art and open challenges  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03601.pdf)
>  Correctly identifying vulnerable road users (VRUs), e.g. cyclists and pedestrians, remains one of the most challenging environment perception tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). This work surveys the current state-of-the-art in VRU detection, covering topics such as benchmarks and datasets, object detection techniques and relevant machine learning algorithms. The article concludes with a discussion of remaining open challenges and promising future research directions for this domain. 
### 25.NeurAll: Towards a Unified Model for Visual Perception in Automated Driving  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03589.pdf)
>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are successfully used for the important automotive visual perception tasks including object recognition, motion and depth estimation, visual SLAM, etc. However, these tasks are independently explored and modeled. In this paper, we propose a joint multi-task network design called NeurAll for learning all tasks simultaneously. Our main motivation is the computational efficiency achieved by sharing the expensive initial convolutional layers between all tasks. Indeed, the main bottleneck in automated driving systems is the limited processing power available on deployment hardware. There could be other benefits in improving accuracy for some tasks and it eases development effort. It also offers scalability to add more tasks leveraging existing features and achieving better generalization. We survey various CNN based solutions for visual perception tasks in automated driving. Then we propose a unified CNN model for the important tasks and discuss several advanced optimization and architecture design techniques to improve the baseline model. The paper is partly review and partly positional with demonstration of several preliminary results promising for future research. Firstly, we show that an efficient two-task model performing semantic segmentation and object detection achieves similar accuracies compared to separate models on various datasets with minimized runtime. We then illustrate that using depth regression as auxiliary task improves semantic segmentation and using multi-stream semantic segmentation outperforms one-stream semantic segmentation. The two-task network achieves 30 fps on an automotive grade low power SOC for 1280x384 image resolution 
### 26.Angle-Closure Detection in Anterior Segment OCT based on Multi-Level Deep Network  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03585.pdf)
>  Irreversible visual impairment is often caused by primary angle-closure glaucoma, which could be detected via Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT). In this paper, an automated system based on deep learning is presented for angle-closure detection in AS-OCT images. Our system learns a discriminative representation from training data that captures subtle visual cues not modeled by handcrafted features. A Multi-Level Deep Network (MLDN) is proposed to formulate this learning, which utilizes three particular AS-OCT regions based on clinical priors: the global anterior segment structure, local iris region, and anterior chamber angle (ACA) patch. In our method, a sliding window based detector is designed to localize the ACA region, which addresses ACA detection as a regression task. Then, three parallel sub-networks are applied to extract AS-OCT representations for the global image and at clinically-relevant local regions. Finally, the extracted deep features of these sub-networks are concatenated into one fully connected layer to predict the angle-closure detection result. In the experiments, our system is shown to surpass previous detection methods and other deep learning systems on two clinical AS-OCT datasets. 
### 27.Cross-spectral Face Completion for NIR-VIS Heterogeneous Face Recognition  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03565.pdf)
>  Near infrared-visible (NIR-VIS) heterogeneous face recognition refers to the process of matching NIR to VIS face images. Current heterogeneous methods try to extend VIS face recognition methods to the NIR spectrum by synthesizing VIS images from NIR images. However, due to self-occlusion and sensing gap, NIR face images lose some visible lighting contents so that they are always incomplete compared to VIS face images. This paper models high resolution heterogeneous face synthesis as a complementary combination of two components, a texture inpainting component and pose correction component. The inpainting component synthesizes and inpaints VIS image textures from NIR image textures. The correction component maps any pose in NIR images to a frontal pose in VIS images, resulting in paired NIR and VIS textures. A warping procedure is developed to integrate the two components into an end-to-end deep network. A fine-grained discriminator and a wavelet-based discriminator are designed to supervise intra-class variance and visual quality respectively. One UV loss, two adversarial losses and one pixel loss are imposed to ensure synthesis results. We demonstrate that by attaching the correction component, we can simplify heterogeneous face synthesis from one-to-many unpaired image translation to one-to-one paired image translation, and minimize spectral and pose discrepancy during heterogeneous recognition. Extensive experimental results show that our network not only generates high-resolution VIS face images and but also facilitates the accuracy improvement of heterogeneous face recognition. 
### 28.Deep learning and face recognition: the state of the art  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03524.pdf)
>  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have established themselves as a dominant technique in machine learning. DNNs have been top performers on a wide variety of tasks including image classification, speech recognition, and face recognition. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used in nearly all of the top performing methods on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. In this talk and accompanying paper, I attempt to provide a review and summary of the deep learning techniques used in the state-of-the-art. In addition, I highlight the need for both larger and more challenging public datasets to benchmark these systems. The high accuracy (99.63% for FaceNet at the time of publishing) and utilization of outside data (hundreds of millions of images in the case of Google&#39;s FaceNet) suggest that current face verification benchmarks such as LFW may not be challenging enough, nor provide enough data, for current techniques. There exist a variety of organizations with mobile photo sharing applications that would be capable of releasing a very large scale and highly diverse dataset of facial images captured on mobile devices. Such an &#34;ImageNet for Face Recognition&#34; would likely receive a warm welcome from researchers and practitioners alike. 
### 29.Facial Micro-Expression Spotting and Recognition using Time Contrasted Feature with Visual Memory  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03514.pdf)
>  Facial micro-expressions are sudden involuntary minute muscle movements which reveal true emotions that people try to conceal. Spotting a micro-expression and recognizing it is a major challenge owing to its short duration and intensity. Many works pursued traditional and deep learning based approaches to solve this issue but compromised on learning low-level features and higher accuracy due to unavailability of datasets. This motivated us to propose a novel joint architecture of spatial and temporal network which extracts time-contrasted features from the feature maps to contrast out micro-expression from rapid muscle movements. The usage of time contrasted features greatly improved the spotting of micro-expression from inconspicuous facial movements. Also, we include a memory module to predict the class and intensity of the micro-expression across the temporal frames of the micro-expression clip. Our method achieves superior performance in comparison to other conventional approaches on CASMEII dataset. 
### 30.Depth-Map Generation using Pixel Matching in Stereoscopic Pair of Images  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03471.pdf)
>  Modern day multimedia content generation and dissemination is moving towards the presentation of more and more `realistic&#39; scenarios. The switch from 2-dimensional (2D) to 3-dimensional (3D) has been a major driving force in that direction. Over the recent past, a large number of approaches have been proposed for creating 3D images/videos most of which are based on the generation of depth-maps. This paper presents a new algorithm for obtaining depth information pertaining to a depicted scene from a set of available pair of stereoscopic images. The proposed algorithm performs a pixel-to-pixel matching of the two images in the stereo pair for estimation of depth. It is shown that the obtained depth-maps show improvements over the reported counterparts. 
### 31.Super-realtime facial landmark detection and shape fitting by deep regression of shape model parameters  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03459.pdf)
>  We present a method for highly efficient landmark detection that combines deep convolutional neural networks with well established model-based fitting algorithms. Motivated by established model-based fitting methods such as active shapes, we use a PCA of the landmark positions to allow generative modeling of facial landmarks. Instead of computing the model parameters using iterative optimization, the PCA is included in a deep neural network using a novel layer type. The network predicts model parameters in a single forward pass, thereby allowing facial landmark detection at several hundreds of frames per second. Our architecture allows direct end-to-end training of a model-based landmark detection method and shows that deep neural networks can be used to reliably predict model parameters directly without the need for an iterative optimization. The method is evaluated on different datasets for facial landmark detection and medical image segmentation. PyTorch code is freely available at <a href="https://github.com/justusschock/shapenet">this https URL</a> 
### 32.3D Hand Shape and Pose from Images in the Wild  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03451.pdf)
>  We present in this work the first end-to-end deep learning based method that predicts both 3D hand shape and pose from RGB images in the wild. Our network consists of the concatenation of a deep convolutional encoder, and a fixed model-based decoder. Given an input image, and optionally 2D joint detections obtained from an independent CNN, the encoder predicts a set of hand and view parameters. The decoder has two components: A pre-computed articulated mesh deformation hand model that generates a 3D mesh from the hand parameters, and a re-projection module controlled by the view parameters that projects the generated hand into the image domain. We show that using the shape and pose prior knowledge encoded in the hand model within a deep learning framework yields state-of-the-art performance in 3D pose prediction from images on standard benchmarks, and produces geometrically valid and plausible 3D reconstructions. Additionally, we show that training with weak supervision in the form of 2D joint annotations on datasets of images in the wild, in conjunction with full supervision in the form of 3D joint annotations on limited available datasets allows for good generalization to 3D shape and pose predictions on images in the wild. 
### 33.Yes, we GAN: Applying Adversarial Techniques for Autonomous Driving  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03442.pdf)
>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have gained a lot of popularity from their introduction in 2014 till present. Research on GAN is rapidly growing and there are many variants of the original GAN focusing on various aspects of deep learning. GAN are perceived as the most impactful direction of machine learning in the last decade. This paper focuses on the application of GAN in autonomous driving including topics such as advanced data augmentation, loss function learning, semi-supervised learning, etc. We formalize and review key applications of adversarial techniques and discuss challenges and open problems to be addressed. 
### 34.When Causal Intervention Meets Image Masking and Adversarial Perturbation for Deep Neural Networks  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03380.pdf)
>  Discovering and exploiting the causality in deep neural networks (DNNs) are crucial challenges for understanding and reasoning causal effects (CE) on an explainable visual model. &#34;Intervention&#34; has been widely used for recognizing a causal relation ontologically. In this paper, we propose a causal inference framework for visual reasoning via do-calculus. To study the intervention effects on pixel-level feature(s) for causal reasoning, we introduce pixel-wise masking and adversarial perturbation. In our framework, CE is calculated using features in a latent space and perturbed prediction from a DNN-based model. We further provide a first look into the characteristics of discovered CE of adversarially perturbed images generated by gradient-based methods. Experimental results show that CE is a competitive and robust index for understanding DNNs when compared with conventional methods such as class-activation mappings (CAMs) on the ChestX-ray 14 dataset for human-interpretable feature(s) (e.g., symptom) reasoning. Moreover, CE holds promises for detecting adversarial examples as it possesses distinct characteristics in the presence of adversarial perturbations. 
### 35.Region based Ensemble Learning Network for Fine-grained Classification  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03377.pdf)
>  As an important research topic in computer vision, fine-grained classification which aims to recognition subordinate-level categories has attracted significant attention. We propose a novel region based ensemble learning network for fine-grained classification. Our approach contains a detection module and a module for classification. The detection module is based on the faster R-CNN framework to locate the semantic regions of the object. The classification module using an ensemble learning method, which trains a set of sub-classifiers for different semantic regions and combines them together to get a stronger classifier. In the evaluation, we implement experiments on the CUB-2011 dataset and the result of experiments proves our method s efficient for fine-grained classification. We also extend our approach to remote scene recognition and evaluate it on the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset. 
### 36.Skin Lesion Analysis Toward Melanoma Detection 2018: A Challenge Hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03368.pdf)
>  The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) is a global partnership that has organized the world&#39;s largest public repository of dermoscopic images of skin lesions. This archive has been used for 3 consecutive years to host challenges on skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection, covering 3 analysis tasks of lesion segmentation, lesion attribute detection, and disease classification. The most recent instance in 2018 was hosted at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) conference in Granada, Spain. The dataset included over 10,000 images. Approximately 900 users registered for data download, 115 submitted to the lesion segmentation task, 25 submitted to the lesion attribute detection task, and 159 submitted to the disease classification task, making this the largest study in the field to date. Important new analyses were introduced to better reflect the difficulties of translating research systems to clinical practice. This article summarizes the results of these analyses, and makes recommendations for future challenges in medical imaging. 
### 37.Image Decomposition and Classification through a Generative Model  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03361.pdf)
>  We demonstrate in this paper that a generative model can be designed to perform classification tasks under challenging settings, including adversarial attacks and input distribution shifts. Specifically, we propose a conditional variational autoencoder that learns both the decomposition of inputs and the distributions of the resulting components. During test, we jointly optimize the latent variables of the generator and the relaxed component labels to find the best match between the given input and the output of the generator. The model demonstrates promising performance at recognizing overlapping components from the multiMNIST dataset, and novel component combinations from a traffic sign dataset. Experiments also show that the proposed model achieves high robustness on MNIST and NORB datasets, in particular for high-strength gradient attacks and non-gradient attacks. 
### 38.Challenges in Partially-Automated Roadway Feature Mapping Using Mobile Laser Scanning and Vehicle Trajectory Data  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03346.pdf)
>  Connected vehicle and driver&#39;s assistance applications are greatly facilitated by Enhanced Digital Maps (EDMs) that represent roadway features (e.g., lane edges or centerlines, stop bars). Due to the large number of signalized intersections and miles of roadway, manual development of EDMs on a global basis is not feasible. Mobile Terrestrial Laser Scanning (MTLS) is the preferred data acquisition method to provide data for automated EDM development. Such systems provide an MTLS trajectory and a point cloud for the roadway environment. The challenge is to automatically convert these data into an EDM. This article presents a new processing and feature extraction method, experimental demonstration providing SAE-J2735 map messages for eleven example intersections, and a discussion of the results that points out remaining challenges and suggests directions for future research. 
### 39.Photorealistic Image Synthesis for Object Instance Detection  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03334.pdf)
>  We present an approach to synthesize highly photorealistic images of 3D object models, which we use to train a convolutional neural network for detecting the objects in real images. The proposed approach has three key ingredients: (1) 3D object models are rendered in 3D models of complete scenes with realistic materials and lighting, (2) plausible geometric configuration of objects and cameras in a scene is generated using physics simulations, and (3) high photorealism of the synthesized images achieved by physically based rendering. When trained on images synthesized by the proposed approach, the Faster R-CNN object detector achieves a 24% absolute improvement of mAP@.75IoU on Rutgers APC and 11% on LineMod-Occluded datasets, compared to a baseline where the training images are synthesized by rendering object models on top of random photographs. This work is a step towards being able to effectively train object detectors without capturing or annotating any real images. A dataset of 600K synthetic images with ground truth annotations for various computer vision tasks will be released on the project website: thodan.github.io/objectsynth. 
### 40.Architecture Compression  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03326.pdf)
>  In this paper we propose a novel approach to model compression termed Architecture Compression. Instead of operating on the weight or filter space of the network like classical model compression methods, our approach operates on the architecture space. A 1-D CNN encoder-decoder is trained to learn a mapping from discrete architecture space to a continuous embedding and back. Additionally, this embedding is jointly trained to regress accuracy and parameter count in order to incorporate information about the architecture&#39;s effectiveness on the dataset. During the compression phase, we first encode the network and then perform gradient descent in continuous space to optimize a compression objective function that maximizes accuracy and minimizes parameter count. The final continuous feature is then mapped to a discrete architecture using the decoder. We demonstrate the merits of this approach on visual recognition tasks such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Fashion-MNIST and SVHN and achieve a greater than 20x compression on CIFAR-10. 
### 41.FERAtt: Facial Expression Recognition with Attention Net  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03284.pdf)
>  We present a new end-to-end network architecture for facial expression recognition with an attention model. It focuses attention in the human face and uses a Gaussian space representation for expression recognition. We devise this architecture based on two fundamental complementary components: (1) facial image correction and attention and (2) facial expression representation and classification. The first component uses an encoder-decoder style network and a convolutional feature extractor that are pixel-wise multiplied to obtain a feature attention map. The second component is responsible for obtaining an embedded representation and classification of the facial expression. We propose a loss function that creates a Gaussian structure on the representation space. To demonstrate the proposed method, we create two larger and more comprehensive synthetic datasets using the traditional BU3DFE and CK+ facial datasets. We compared results with the PreActResNet18 baseline. Our experiments on these datasets have shown the superiority of our approach in recognizing facial expressions. 
### 42.Skin Lesion Synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03253.pdf)
>  Skin cancer is by far the most common type of cancer. Early detection is the key to increase the chances for successful treatment significantly. Currently, Deep Neural Networks are the state-of-the-art results on automated skin cancer classification. To push the results further, we need to address the lack of annotated data, which is expensive and require much effort from specialists. To bypass this problem, we propose using Generative Adversarial Networks for generating realistic synthetic skin lesion images. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first to show visually-appealing synthetic images that comprise clinically-meaningful information. 
### 43.Cyclical Stochastic Gradient MCMC for Bayesian Deep Learning  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03932.pdf)
>  The posteriors over neural network weights are high dimensional and multimodal. Each mode typically characterizes a meaningfully different representation of the data. We develop Cyclical Stochastic Gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC) to automatically explore such distributions. In particular, we propose a cyclical stepsize schedule, where larger steps discover new modes, and smaller steps characterize each mode. We prove that our proposed learning rate schedule provides faster convergence to samples from a stationary distribution than SG-MCMC with standard decaying schedules. Moreover, we provide extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of cyclical SG-MCMC in learning complex multimodal distributions, especially for fully Bayesian inference with modern deep neural networks. 
### 44.Learning Vector Representation of Content and Matrix Representation of Change: Towards a Representational Model of V1  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03871.pdf)
>  This paper entertains the hypothesis that the primary purpose of the cells of the primary visual cortex (V1) is to perceive motions and predict changes of local image contents. Specifically, we propose a model that couples the vector representations of local image contents with the matrix representations of local pixel displacements caused by the relative motions between the agent and the surrounding objects and scene. When the image changes from one time frame to the next due to pixel displacements, the vector at each pixel is multiplied by a matrix that represents the displacement of this pixel. We show that by learning from pair of images that are deformed versions of each other, we can learn both vector and matrix representations. The units in the learned vector representations resemble V1 cells. The learned vector-matrix representations enable prediction of image frames over time, and more importantly, inference of the local pixel displacements caused by relative motions. 
### 45.Semantic Label Reduction Techniques for Autonomous Driving  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03777.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation maps can be used as input to models for maneuvering the controls of a car. However, not all labels may be necessary for making the control decision. One would expect that certain labels such as road lanes or sidewalks would be more critical in comparison with labels for vegetation or buildings which may not have a direct influence on the car&#39;s driving decision. In this appendix, we evaluate and quantify how sensitive and important the different semantic labels are for controlling the car. Labels that do not influence the driving decision are remapped to other classes, thereby simplifying the task by reducing to only labels critical for driving of the vehicle. 
### 46.Latent Space Reinforcement Learning for Steering Angle Prediction  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03765.pdf)
>  Model-free reinforcement learning has recently been shown to successfully learn navigation policies from raw sensor data. In this work, we address the problem of learning driving policies for an autonomous agent in a high-fidelity simulator. Building upon recent research that applies deep reinforcement learning to navigation problems, we present a modular deep reinforcement learning approach to predict the steering angle of the car from raw images. The first module extracts a low-dimensional latent semantic representation of the image. The control module trained with reinforcement learning takes the latent vector as input to predict the correct steering angle. The experimental results have showed that our method is capable of learning to maneuver the car without any human control signals. 
### 47.Prediction of Dashed Café Wall illusion by the Classical Receptive Field Model  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03739.pdf)
>  The Café Wall illusion is one of a class of tilt illusions where lines that are parallel appear to be tilted. We demonstrate that a simple Differences of Gaussian model provides an explanatory mechanism for the illusory tilt perceived in a family of Café Wall illusion generalizes to the dashed versions of Café Wall. Our explanation models the visual mechanisms in low-level stages that can reveal tilt cues in Geometrical distortion illusions such as Tile illusions particularly Café Wall illusions. For this, we simulate the activation of the retinal/cortical simple cells in responses to these patterns based on a Classical Receptive Field (CRF) model to explain tilt effects in these illusions. Previously, it was assumed that all these visual experiences of tilt arise from the orientation selectivity properties described for more complex cortical cells. An estimation of an overall tilt angle perceived in these illusions is based on the integration of the local tilts detected by simple cells which is presumed to be a key mechanism utilized by the complex cells to create our final perception of tilt. 
### 48.Paradigm shift in electron-based crystallography via machine learning  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03682.pdf)
>  Accurately determining the crystallographic structure of a material, organic or inorganic, is a critical primary step in material development and analysis. The most common practices involve analysis of diffraction patterns produced in laboratory XRD, TEM, and synchrotron X-ray sources. However, these techniques are slow, require careful sample preparation, can be difficult to access, and are prone to human error during analysis. This paper presents a newly developed methodology that represents a paradigm change in electron diffraction-based structure analysis techniques, with the potential to revolutionize multiple crystallography-related fields. A machine learning-based approach for rapid and autonomous identification of the crystal structure of metals and alloys, ceramics, and geological specimens, without any prior knowledge of the sample, is presented and demonstrated utilizing the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique. Electron backscatter diffraction patterns are collected from materials with well-known crystal structures, then a deep neural network model is constructed for classification to a specific Bravais lattice or point group. The applicability of this approach is evaluated on diffraction patterns from samples unknown to the computer without any human input or data filtering. This is in comparison to traditional Hough transform EBSD, which requires that you have already determined the phases present in your sample. The internal operations of the neural network are elucidated through visualizing the symmetry features learned by the convolutional neural network. It is determined that the model looks for the same features a crystallographer would use, even though it is not explicitly programmed to do so. This study opens the door to fully automated, high-throughput determination of crystal structures via several electron-based diffraction techniques. 
### 49.Learning From Noisy Labels By Regularized Estimation Of Annotator Confusion  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03680.pdf)
>  The predictive performance of supervised learning algorithms depends on the quality of labels. In a typical label collection process, multiple annotators provide subjective noisy estimates of the &#34;truth&#34; under the influence of their varying skill-levels and biases. Blindly treating these noisy labels as the ground truth limits the accuracy of learning algorithms in the presence of strong disagreement. This problem is critical for applications in domains such as medical imaging where both the annotation cost and inter-observer variability are high. In this work, we present a method for simultaneously learning the individual annotator model and the underlying true label distribution, using only noisy observations. Each annotator is modeled by a confusion matrix that is jointly estimated along with the classifier predictions. We propose to add a regularization term to the loss function that encourages convergence to the true annotator confusion matrix. We provide a theoretical argument as to how the regularization is essential to our approach both for the case of single annotator and multiple annotators. Despite the simplicity of the idea, experiments on image classification tasks with both simulated and real labels show that our method either outperforms or performs on par with the state-of-the-art methods and is capable of estimating the skills of annotators even with a single label available per image. 
### 50.Colorectal Cancer Outcome Prediction from H&amp;E Whole Slide Images using Machine Learning and Automatically Inferred Phenotype Profiles  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03582.pdf)
>  Digital pathology (DP) is a new research area which falls under the broad umbrella of health informatics. Owing to its potential for major public health impact, in recent years DP has been attracting much research attention. Nevertheless, a wide breadth of significant conceptual and technical challenges remain, few of them greater than those encountered in digital oncology. The automatic analysis of digital pathology slides of cancerous tissues is particularly problematic due to the inherent heterogeneity of the disease, extremely large images, and numerous others. In this paper we introduce a novel machine learning based framework for the prediction of colorectal cancer outcome from whole haematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) stained histopathology slides. Using a real-world data set we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and present a detailed analysis of its different elements which corroborate its ability to extract and learn salient, discriminative, and clinically meaningful content. 
### 51.EvalAI: Towards Better Evaluation Systems for AI Agents  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03570.pdf)
>  We introduce EvalAI, an open source platform for evaluating and comparing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence algorithms (AI) at scale. EvalAI is built to provide a scalable solution to the research community to fulfill the critical need of evaluating machine learning models and agents acting in an environment against annotations or with a human-in-the-loop. This will help researchers, students, and data scientists to create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges organized around the globe. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking these models, EvalAI seeks to lower the barrier to entry for participating in the global scientific effort to push the frontiers of machine learning and artificial intelligence, thereby increasing the rate of measurable progress in this domain. 
### 52.An Algorithm Unrolling Approach to Deep Blind Image Deblurring  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03493.pdf)
>  Blind image deblurring remains a topic of enduring interest. Learning based approaches, especially those that employ neural networks have emerged to complement traditional model based methods and in many cases achieve vastly enhanced performance. That said, neural network approaches are generally empirically designed and the underlying structures are difficult to interpret. In recent years, a promising technique called algorithm unrolling has been developed that has helped connect iterative algorithms such as those for sparse coding to neural network architectures. However, such connections have not been made yet for blind image deblurring. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture based on this idea. We first present an iterative algorithm that may be considered as a generalization of the traditional total-variation regularization method in the gradient domain. We then unroll the algorithm to construct a neural network for image deblurring which we refer to as Deep Unrolling for Blind Deblurring (DUBLID). Key algorithm parameters are learned with the help of training images. Our proposed deep network DUBLID achieves significant practical performance gains while enjoying interpretability at the same time. Extensive experimental results show that DUBLID outperforms many state-of-the-art methods and in addition is computationally faster. 
### 53.The Omniglot Challenge: A 3-Year Progress Report  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03477.pdf)
>  Three years ago, we released the Omniglot dataset for developing more human-like learning algorithms. Omniglot is a one-shot learning challenge, inspired by how people can learn a new concept from just one or a few examples. Along with the dataset, we proposed a suite of five challenge tasks and a computational model based on probabilistic program induction that addresses them. The computational model, although powerful, was not meant to be the final word on Omniglot; we hoped that the machine learning community would both build on our work and develop novel approaches to tackling the challenge. In the time since, we have been pleased to see the wide adoption of Omniglot and notable technical progress. There has been genuine progress on one-shot classification, but it has been difficult to measure since researchers have adopted different splits and training procedures that make the task easier. The other four tasks, while essential components of human conceptual understanding, have received considerably less attention. We review the progress so far and conclude that neural networks are still far from human-like concept learning on Omniglot, a challenge that requires performing all of the tasks with a single model. We also discuss new tasks to stimulate further progress. 
### 54.Hierarchical Multi-task Deep Neural Network Architecture for End-to-End Driving  [ pdf ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03466.pdf)
>  A novel hierarchical Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is presented to address the task of end-to-end driving. The model consists of a master classifier network which determines the driving task required from an input stereo image and directs said image to one of a set of subservient network regression models that perform inference and output a steering command. These subservient networks are designed and trained for a specific driving task: straightaway, swerve maneuver, tight turn, gradual turn, and chicane. Using this modular network strategy allows for two primary advantages: an overall reduction in the amount of data required to train the complete system, and for model tailoring where more complex models can be used for more challenging tasks while simplified networks can handle more mundane tasks. It is this latter facet of the model that makes the approach attractive to a number of applications beyond the current vehicle steering strategy.
