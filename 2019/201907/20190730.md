### 1.Towards Automatic Screening of Typical and Atypical Behaviors in Children With Autism  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12537.pdf)
>  Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) impact the cognitive, social, communicative and behavioral abilities of an individual. The development of new clinical decision support systems is of importance in reducing the delay between presentation of symptoms and an accurate diagnosis. In this work, we contribute a new database consisting of video clips of typical (normal) and atypical (such as hand flapping, spinning or rocking) behaviors, displayed in natural settings, which have been collected from the YouTube video website. We propose a preliminary non-intrusive approach based on skeleton keypoint identification using pretrained deep neural networks on human body video clips to extract features and perform body movement analysis that differentiates typical and atypical behaviors of children. Experimental results on the newly contributed database show that our platform performs best with decision tree as the classifier when compared to other popular methodologies and offers a baseline against which alternate approaches may developed and tested. 
### 2.Benefiting from Multitask Learning to Improve Single Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12488.pdf)
>  Despite significant progress toward super resolving more realistic images by deeper convolutional neural networks (CNNs), reconstructing fine and natural textures still remains a challenging problem. Recent works on single image super resolution (SISR) are mostly based on optimizing pixel and content wise similarity between recovered and high-resolution (HR) images and do not benefit from recognizability of semantic classes. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach using categorical information to tackle the SISR problem; we present a decoder architecture able to extract and use semantic information to super-resolve a given image by using multitask learning, simultaneously for image super-resolution and semantic segmentation. To explore categorical information during training, the proposed decoder only employs one shared deep network for two task-specific output layers. At run-time only layers resulting HR image are used and no segmentation label is required. Extensive perceptual experiments and a user study on images randomly selected from COCO-Stuff dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 3.X-LineNet: Detecting Aircraft in Remote Sensing Images by a pair of Intersecting Line Segments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12474.pdf)
>  In the field of aircraft detection, tremendous progress has been gained movitated by the development of deep convolution neural networks(DCNNs). At present, most state-of-art models based on DCNNs belong to top-down approaches which take a wide use of anchor mechanism. The obtaining of high accuracy in them relys on the enumeration of massive potentional locations of objects with the form of rectangular bounding box, which is wasteful and less elaborate. In this paper, we present a novel aircraft detection model in a bottom-up manner, which formulated the task as detection of two intersecting line segments inside each target and grouping of them, thus we name it as X-LineNet. As the result of learning more delicate visual grammars information of aircraft, detection results with more concrete details and higher accuracy can be gained by X-LineNet. Just for these advantages, we designed a novel form of detetction results--pentagonal mask which has less redundancy and can better represent airplanes than that of rectangular box in remote sensing images. 
### 4.Self-Supervised Learning for Stereo Reconstruction on Aerial Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12446.pdf)
>  Recent developments established deep learning as an inevitable tool to boost the performance of dense matching and stereo estimation. On the downside, learning these networks requires a substantial amount of training data to be successful. Consequently, the application of these models outside of the laboratory is far from straight forward. In this work we propose a self-supervised training procedure that allows us to adapt our network to the specific (imaging) characteristics of the dataset at hand, without the requirement of external ground truth data. We instead generate interim training data by running our intermediate network on the whole dataset, followed by conservative outlier filtering. Bootstrapped from a pre-trained version of our hybrid CNN-CRF model, we alternate the generation of training data and network training. With this simple concept we are able to lift the completeness and accuracy of the pre-trained version significantly. We also show that our final model compares favorably to other popular stereo estimation algorithms on an aerial dataset. 
### 5.Salient Slices: Improved Neural Network Training and Performance with Image Entropy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12436.pdf)
>  As a training and analysis strategy for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we slice images into tiled segments and use, for training and prediction, segments that both satisfy a criterion of information diversity and contain sufficient content to support classification. In particular, we utilize image entropy as the diversity criterion. This ensures that each tile carries as much information diversity as the original image, and for many applications serves as an indicator of usefulness in classification. To make predictions, a probability aggregation framework is applied to probabilities assigned by the CNN to the input image tiles. This technique facilitates the use of large, high-resolution images that would be impractical to analyze unmodified; provides data augmentation for training, which is particularly valuable when image availability is limited; and the ensemble nature of the input for prediction enhances its accuracy. 
### 6.Learn to Scale: Generating Multipolar Normalized Density Map for Crowd Counting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12428.pdf)
>  Dense crowd counting aims to predict thousands of human instances from an image, by calculating integrals of a density map over image pixels. Existing approaches mainly suffer from the extreme density variances. Such density pattern shift poses challenges even for multi-scale model ensembling. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to tackle this problem. First, a patch-level density map is extracted by a density estimation model, and is further grouped into several density levels which are determined over full datasets. Second, each patch density map is automatically normalized by an online center learning strategy with a multipolar center loss (MPCL). Such a design can significantly condense the density distribution into several clusters, and enable that the density variance can be learned by a single model. Extensive experiments show the best accuracy of the proposed framework in several crowd counting datasets, with relative accuracy gains of 4.2%, 14.3%, 27.1%, 20.1% over the state-of-the-art approaches, in ShanghaiTech-Part A, Part B, UCF_CC_50, UCF-QNRF dataset, respectively. 
### 7.Consensus Feature Network for Scene Parsing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12411.pdf)
>  Scene parsing is challenging as it aims to assign one of the semantic categories to each pixel in scene images. Thus, pixel-level features are desired for scene parsing. However, classification networks are dominated by the discriminative portion, so directly applying classification networks to scene parsing will result in inconsistent parsing predictions within one instance and among instances of the same category. To address this problem, we propose two transform units to learn pixel-level consensus features. One is an Instance Consensus Transform (ICT) unit to learn the instance-level consensus features by aggregating features within the same instance. The other is a Category Consensus Transform (CCT) unit to pursue category-level consensus features through keeping the consensus of features among instances of the same category in scene images. The proposed ICT and CCT units are lightweight, data-driven and end-to-end trainable. The features learned by the two units are more coherent in both instance-level and category-level. Furthermore, we present the Consensus Feature Network (CFNet) based on the proposed ICT and CCT units. Experiments on four scene parsing benchmarks, including Cityscapes, Pascal Context, CamVid, and COCO Stuff, show that the proposed CFNet learns pixel-level consensus feature and obtain consistent parsing results. 
### 8.Specular- and Diffuse-reflection-based Face Liveness Detection for Mobile Devices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12400.pdf)
>  In light of the rising demand for biometric-authentication systems, preventing face spoofing attacks is a critical issue for the safe deployment of face recognition systems. Here, we propose an efficient liveness detection algorithm that requires minimal hardware and only a small database, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones. Utilizing one monocular visible light camera, the proposed algorithm takes two facial photos, one taken with a flash, the other without a flash. The proposed $SpecDiff$ descriptor is constructed by leveraging two types of reflection: (i) specular reflections from the iris region that have a specific intensity distribution depending on liveness, and (ii) diffuse reflections from the entire face region that represents the 3D structure of a subject's face. Classifiers trained with $SpecDiff$ descriptor outperforms other flash-based liveness detection algorithms on both an in-house database and on publicly available NUAA and Replay-Attack databases. Moreover, the proposed algorithm achieves comparable accuracy to that of an end-to-end, deep neural network classifier, while being approximately ten-times faster execution speed. 
### 9.Recursive Cascaded Networks for Unsupervised Medical Image Registration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12353.pdf)
>  We present recursive cascaded networks, a general architecture that enables learning deep cascades, for deformable image registration. The proposed architecture is simple in design and can be built on any base network. The moving image is warped successively by each cascade and finally aligned to the fixed image; this procedure is recursive in a way that every cascade learns to perform a progressive deformation for the current warped image. The entire system is end-to-end and jointly trained in an unsupervised manner. In addition, enabled by the recursive architecture, one cascade can be iteratively applied for multiple times during testing, which approaches a better fit between each of the image pairs. We evaluate our method on 3D medical images, where deformable registration is most commonly applied. We demonstrate that recursive cascaded networks achieve consistent, significant gains and outperform state-of-the-art methods. The performance reveals an increasing trend as long as more cascades are trained, while the limit is not observed. Our code will be made publicly available. 
### 10.FSS-1000: A 1000-Class Dataset for Few-Shot Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12347.pdf)
>  Over the past few years, we have witnessed the success of deep learning in image recognition thanks to the availability of large-scale human-annotated datasets such as PASCAL VOC, ImageNet, and COCO. Although these datasets have covered a wide range of object categories, there are still a significant number of objects that are not included. Can we perform the same task without a lot of human annotations? In this paper, we are interested in few-shot object segmentation where the number of annotated training examples are limited to 5 only. To evaluate and validate the performance of our approach, we have built a few-shot segmentation dataset, FSS-1000, which consists of 1000 object classes with pixelwise annotation of ground-truth segmentation. Unique in FSS-1000, our dataset contains significant number of objects that have never been seen or annotated in previous datasets, such as tiny daily objects, merchandise, cartoon characters, logos, etc. We build our baseline model using standard backbone networks such as VGG-16, ResNet-101, and Inception. To our surprise, we found that training our model from scratch using FSS-1000 achieves comparable and even better results than training with weights pre-trained by ImageNet which is more than 100 times larger than FSS-1000. Both our approach and dataset are simple, effective, and easily extensible to learn segmentation of new object classes given very few annotated training examples.

### 11.Meta Learning for Task-Driven Video Summarization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12342.pdf)
>  Existing video summarization approaches mainly concentrate on sequential or structural characteristic of video data. However, they do not pay enough attention to the video summarization task itself. In this paper, we propose a meta learning method for performing task-driven video summarization, denoted by MetaL-TDVS, to explicitly explore the video summarization mechanism among summarizing processes on different videos. Particularly, MetaL-TDVS aims to excavate the latent mechanism for summarizing video by reformulating video summarization as a meta learning problem and promote generalization ability of the trained model. MetaL-TDVS regards summarizing each video as a single task to make better use of the experience and knowledge learned from processes of summarizing other videos to summarize new ones. Furthermore, MetaL-TDVS updates models via a two-fold back propagation which forces the model optimized on one video to obtain high accuracy on another video in every training step. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and better generalization ability of MetaL-TDVS against several state-of-the-art methods. 
### 12.Goal-Driven Sequential Data Abstraction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12336.pdf)
>  Automatic data abstraction is an important capability for both benchmarking machine intelligence and supporting summarization applications. In the former one asks whether a machine can `understand' enough about the meaning of input data to produce a meaningful but more compact abstraction. In the latter this capability is exploited for saving space or human time by summarizing the essence of input data. In this paper we study a general reinforcement learning based framework for learning to abstract sequential data in a goal-driven way. The ability to define different abstraction goals uniquely allows different aspects of the input data to be preserved according to the ultimate purpose of the abstraction. Our reinforcement learning objective does not require human-defined examples of ideal abstraction. Importantly our model processes the input sequence holistically without being constrained by the original input order. Our framework is also domain agnostic -- we demonstrate applications to sketch, video and text data and achieve promising results in all domains. 
### 13.Multi-Task Attention-Based Semi-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12303.pdf)
>  We propose a novel semi-supervised image segmentation method that simultaneously optimizes a supervised segmentation and an unsupervised reconstruction objectives. The reconstruction objective uses an attention mechanism that separates the reconstruction of image areas corresponding to different classes. The proposed approach was evaluated on two applications: brain tumor and white matter hyperintensities segmentation. Our method, trained on unlabeled and a small number of labeled images, outperformed supervised CNNs trained with the same number of images and CNNs pre-trained on unlabeled data. In ablation experiments, we observed that the proposed attention mechanism substantially improves segmentation performance. We explore two multi-task training strategies: joint training and alternating training. Alternating training requires fewer hyperparameters and achieves a better, more stable performance than joint training. Finally, we analyze the features learned by different methods and find that the attention mechanism helps to learn more discriminative features in the deeper layers of encoders. 
### 14.A Two Stage GAN for High Resolution Retinal Image Generation and Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12296.pdf)
>  In recent years, the use of deep learning is becoming increasingly popular in computer vision. However, the effective training of deep architectures usually relies on huge sets of annotated data. This is critical in the medical field where it is difficult and expensive to obtain annotated images. In this paper, we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthesizing high quality retinal images, along with the corresponding semantic label-maps, to be used instead of real images during the training process. Differently from other previous proposals, we suggest a two step approach: first, a progressively growing GAN is trained to generate the semantic label-maps, which describe the blood vessel structure (i.e. vasculature); second, an image-to-image translation approach is used to obtain realistic retinal images from the generated vasculature. By using only a handful of training samples, our approach generates realistic high resolution images, that can be effectively used to enlarge small available datasets. Comparable results have been obtained employing the generated images in place of real data during training. The practical viability of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by applying it on two well established benchmark sets for retinal vessel segmentation, both containing a very small number of training samples. Our method obtained better performances with respect to state-of-the-art techniques. 
### 15.Regularizing Proxies with Multi-Adversarial Training for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12282.pdf)
>  Training a semantic segmentation model requires a large amount of pixel-level annotation, hampering its application at scale. With computer graphics, we can generate almost unlimited training data with precise annotation. However,a deep model trained with synthetic data usually cannot directly generalize well to realistic images due to domain shift. It has been observed that highly confident labels for the unlabeled real images may be predicted relying on the labeled synthetic data. To tackle the unsupervised domain adaptation problem, we explore the possibilities to generate high-quality labels as proxy labels to supervise the training on target data. Specifically, we propose a novel proxy-based method using multi-adversarial training. We first train the model using synthetic data (source domain). Multiple discriminators are used to align the features be-tween the source and target domain (real images) at different levels. Then we focus on obtaining and selecting high-quality proxy labels by incorporating both the confidence of the class predictor and that from the adversarial discriminators. Our discriminators not only work as a regularizer to encourage feature alignment but also provide an alternative confidence measure for generating proxy labels. Relying on the generated high-quality proxies, our model can be trained in a "supervised manner" on the target do-main. On two major tasks, GTA5-&gt;Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-&gt;Cityscapes, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming the previous by a large margin. 
### 16.Interlaced Sparse Self-Attention for Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12273.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a so-called interlaced sparse self-attention approach to improve the efficiency of the \emph{self-attention} mechanism for semantic segmentation. The main idea is that we factorize the dense affinity matrix as the product of two sparse affinity matrices. There are two successive attention modules each estimating a sparse affinity matrix. The first attention module is used to estimate the affinities within a subset of positions that have long spatial interval distances and the second attention module is used to estimate the affinities within a subset of positions that have short spatial interval distances. These two attention modules are designed so that each position is able to receive the information from all the other positions. In contrast to the original self-attention module, our approach decreases the computation and memory complexity substantially especially when processing high-resolution feature maps. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our approach on six challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks. 
### 17.V-PROM: A Benchmark for Visual Reasoning Using Visual Progressive Matrices  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12271.pdf)
>  One of the primary challenges faced by deep learning is the degree to which current methods exploit superficial statistics and dataset bias, rather than learning to generalise over the specific representations they have experienced. This is a critical concern because generalisation enables robust reasoning over unseen data, whereas leveraging superficial statistics is fragile to even small changes in data distribution. To illuminate the issue and drive progress towards a solution, we propose a test that explicitly evaluates abstract reasoning over visual data. We introduce a large-scale benchmark of visual questions that involve operations fundamental to many high-level vision tasks, such as comparisons of counts and logical operations on complex visual properties. The benchmark directly measures a method's ability to infer high-level relationships and to generalise them over image-based concepts. It includes multiple training/test splits that require controlled levels of generalization. We evaluate a range of deep learning architectures, and find that existing models, including those popular for vision-and-language tasks, are unable to solve seemingly-simple instances. Models using relational networks fare better but leave substantial room for improvement. 
### 18.AirFace:Lightweight and Efficient Model for Face Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12256.pdf)
>  With the development of convolutional neural network, significant progress has been made in computer vision tasks. However, the commonly used loss function softmax loss and highly efficient network architecture for common visual tasks are not as effective for face recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function named Li-ArcFace based on ArcFace. Li-ArcFace takes the value of the angle through linear function as the target logit rather than through cosine function, which has better convergence and performance on low dimensional embedding feature learning for face recognition. In terms of network architecture, we improved the the perfomance of MobileFaceNet by increasing the network depth, width and adding attention module. Besides, we found some useful training tricks for face recognition. With all the above results, we won the second place in the deepglint-light challenge of LFR2019. 
### 19.Silhouette Guided Point Cloud Reconstruction beyond Occlusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12253.pdf)
>  One major challenge in 3D reconstruction is to infer the complete shape geometry from partial foreground occlusions. In this paper, we propose a method to reconstruct the complete 3D shape of an object from a single RGB image, with robustness to occlusion. Given the image and a silhouette of the visible region, our approach completes the silhouette of the occluded region and then generates a point cloud. We show improvements for reconstruction of non-occluded and partially occluded objects by providing the predicted complete silhouette as guidance. We also improve state-of-the-art for 3D shape prediction with a 2D reprojection loss from multiple synthetic views and a surface-based smoothing and refinement step. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach both quantitatively and qualitatively on synthetic and real scene datasets. 
### 20.Automatic Registration between Cone-Beam CT and Scanned Surface via Deep-Pose Regression Neural Networks and Clustered Similarities  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12250.pdf)
>  Computerized registration between maxillofacial cone-beam computed tomography (CT) images and a scanned dental model is an essential prerequisite in surgical planning for dental implants or orthognathic surgery. We propose a novel method that performs fully automatic registration between a cone-beam CT image and an optically scanned model. To build a robust and automatic initial registration method, our method applies deep-pose regression neural networks in a reduced domain (i.e., 2-dimensional image). Subsequently, fine registration is performed via optimal clusters. Majority voting system achieves globally optimal transformations while each cluster attempts to optimize local transformation parameters. The coherency of clusters determines their candidacy for the optimal cluster set. The outlying regions in the iso-surface are effectively removed based on the consensus among the optimal clusters. The accuracy of registration was evaluated by the Euclidean distance of 10 landmarks on a scanned model which were annotated by the experts in the field. The experiments show that the proposed method's registration accuracy, measured in landmark distance, outperforms other existing methods by 30.77% to 70%. In addition to achieving high accuracy, our proposed method requires neither human-interactions nor priors (e.g., iso-surface extraction). The main significance of our study is twofold: 1) the employment of light-weighted neural networks which indicates the applicability of neural network in extracting pose cues that can be easily obtained and 2) the introduction of an optimal cluster-based registration method that can avoid metal artifacts during the matching procedures. 
### 21.A Fine-Grain Error Map Prediction and Segmentation Quality Assessment Framework for Whole-Heart Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12244.pdf)
>  When introducing advanced image computing algorithms, e.g., whole-heart segmentation, into clinical practice, a common suspicion is how reliable the automatically computed results are. In fact, it is important to find out the failure cases and identify the misclassified pixels so that they can be excluded or corrected for the subsequent analysis or diagnosis. However, it is not a trivial problem to predict the errors in a segmentation mask when ground truth (usually annotated by experts) is absent. In this work, we attempt to address the pixel-wise error map prediction problem and the per-case mask quality assessment problem using a unified deep learning (DL) framework. Specifically, we first formalize an error map prediction problem, then we convert it to a segmentation problem and build a DL network to tackle it. We also derive a quality indicator (QI) from a predicted error map to measure the overall quality of a segmentation mask. To evaluate the proposed framework, we perform extensive experiments on a public whole-heart segmentation dataset, i.e., MICCAI 2017 MMWHS. By 5-fold cross validation, we obtain an overall Dice score of 0.626 for the error map prediction task, and observe a high Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.972 between QI and the actual segmentation accuracy (Acc), as well as a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0048 between them, which evidences the efficacy of our method in both error map prediction and quality assessment. 
### 22.KNEEL: Knee Anatomical Landmark Localization Using Hourglass Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12237.pdf)
>  This paper addresses the challenge of localization of anatomical landmarks in knee X-ray images at different stages of osteoarthritis (OA). Landmark localization can be viewed as regression problem, where the landmark position is directly predicted by using the region of interest or even full-size images leading to large memory footprint, especially in case of high resolution medical images. In this work, we propose an efficient deep neural networks framework with an hourglass architecture utilizing a soft-argmax layer to directly predict normalized coordinates of the landmark points. We provide an extensive evaluation of different regularization techniques and various loss functions to understand their influence on the localization performance. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of transfer learning from low-budget annotations, and experimentally demonstrate that such approach is improving the accuracy of landmark localization. Compared to the prior methods, we validate our model on two datasets that are independent from the train data and assess the performance of the method for different stages of OA severity. The proposed approach demonstrates better generalization performance compared to the current state-of-the-art. 
### 23.Multi-Granularity Fusion Network for Proposal and Activity Localization: Submission to ActivityNet Challenge 2019 Task 1 and Task 2  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12223.pdf)
>  This technical report presents an overview of our solution used in the submission to ActivityNet Challenge 2019 Task 1 (\textbf{temporal action proposal generation}) and Task 2 (\textbf{temporal action localization/detection}). Temporal action proposal indicates the temporal intervals containing the actions and plays an important role in temporal action localization. Top-down and bottom-up methods are the two main categories used for proposal generation in the existing literature. In this paper, we devise a novel Multi-Granularity Fusion Network (MGFN) to combine the proposals generated from different frameworks for complementary filtering and confidence re-ranking. Specifically, we consider the diversity comprehensively from multiple perspectives, e.g. the characteristic aspect, the data aspect, the model aspect and the result aspect. Our MGFN achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the temporal action proposal task with 69.85 AUC score and the temporal action localization task with 38.90 mAP on the challenge testing set. 
### 24.Automatic Text Line Segmentation Directly in JPEG Compressed Document Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12219.pdf)
>  JPEG is one of the popular image compression algorithms that provide efficient storage and transmission capabilities in consumer electronics, and hence it is the most preferred image format over the internet world. In the present digital and Big-data era, a huge volume of JPEG compressed document images are being archived and communicated through consumer electronics on daily basis. Though it is advantageous to have data in the compressed form on one side, however, on the other side processing with off-the-shelf methods becomes computationally expensive because it requires decompression and recompression operations. Therefore, it would be novel and efficient, if the compressed data are processed directly in their respective compressed domains of consumer electronics. In the present research paper, we propose to demonstrate this idea taking the case study of printed text line segmentation. Since, JPEG achieves compression by dividing the image into non overlapping 8x8 blocks in the pixel domain and using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT); it is very likely that the partitioned 8x8 DCT blocks overlap the contents of two adjacent text-lines without leaving any clue for the line separator, thus making text-line segmentation a challenging problem. Two approaches of segmentation have been proposed here using the DC projection profile and AC coefficients of each 8x8 DCT block. The first approach is based on the strategy of partial decompression of selected DCT blocks, and the second approach is with intelligent analysis of F10 and F11 AC coefficients and without using any type of decompression. The proposed methods have been tested with variable font sizes, font style and spacing between lines, and a good performance is reported. 
### 25.Enforcing geometric constraints of virtual normal for depth prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12209.pdf)
>  Monocular depth prediction plays a crucial role in understanding 3D scene geometry. Although recent methods have achieved impressive progress in evaluation metrics such as the pixel-wise relative error, most methods neglect the geometric constraints in the 3D space. In this work, we show the importance of the high-order 3D geometric constraints for depth prediction. By designing a loss term that enforces one simple type of geometric constraints, namely, virtual normal directions determined by randomly sampled three points in the reconstructed 3D space, we can considerably improve the depth prediction accuracy. Significantly, the byproduct of this predicted depth being sufficiently accurate is that we are now able to recover good 3D structures of the scene such as the point cloud and surface normal directly from the depth, eliminating the necessity of training new sub-models as was previously done. Experiments on two benchmarks: NYU Depth-V2 and KITTI demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and state-of-the-art performance. 
### 26.Seeing Things in Random-Dot Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12195.pdf)
>  The human visual system correctly groups features and interprets videos displaying non persistent and noisy random-dot data induced by imaging natural dynamic scenes. Remarkably, this happens even if perception completely fails when the same information is presented frame by frame. We study this property of surprising dynamic perception with the first goal of proposing a new detection and spatio-temporal grouping algorithm for such signals when, per frame, the information on objects is both random and sparse. The striking similarity in performance of the algorithm to the perception by human observers, as witnessed by a series of psychophysical experiments that were performed, leads us to see in it a simple computational Gestalt model of human perception based on temporal integration and statistical tests of unlikeliness, the a contrario framework. 
### 27.ChaLearn Looking at People: IsoGD and ConGD Large-scale RGB-D Gesture Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12193.pdf)
>  The ChaLearn large-scale gesture recognition challenge has been run twice in two workshops in conjunction with the International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2016 and International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2017, attracting more than $200$ teams round the world. This challenge has two tracks, focusing on isolated and continuous gesture recognition, respectively. This paper describes the creation of both benchmark datasets and analyzes the advances in large-scale gesture recognition based on these two datasets. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground-truth annotations of gesture recognition, and provide a detailed analysis of the current state-of-the-art methods for large-scale isolated and continuous gesture recognition based on RGB-D video sequences. In addition to recognition rate and mean jaccard index (MJI) as evaluation metrics used in our previous challenges, we also introduce the corrected segmentation rate (CSR) metric to evaluate the performance of temporal segmentation for continuous gesture recognition. Furthermore, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) baseline method, determining the video division points based on the skeleton points extracted by convolutional pose machine (CPM). Experiments demonstrate that the proposed Bi-LSTM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with an absolute improvement of $8.1\%$ (from $0.8917$ to $0.9639$) of CSR. 
### 28.End-to-End Learning Deep CRF models for Multi-Object Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12176.pdf)
>  Existing deep multi-object tracking (MOT) approaches first learn a deep representation to describe target objects and then associate detection results by optimizing a linear assignment problem. Despite demonstrated successes, it is challenging to discriminate target objects under mutual occlusion or to reduce identity switches in crowded scenes. In this paper, we propose learning deep conditional random field (CRF) networks, aiming to model the assignment costs as unary potentials and the long-term dependencies among detection results as pairwise potentials. Specifically, we use a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) network to encode the long-term dependencies. We pose the CRF inference as a recurrent neural network learning process using the standard gradient descent algorithm, where unary and pairwise potentials are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results on the challenging MOT datasets including MOT-2015 and MOT-2016, demonstrate that our approach achieves the state of the art performances in comparison with published works on both benchmarks. 
### 29.On the Realization and Analysis of Circular Harmonic Transforms for Feature Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12165.pdf)
>  Cartesian-separable realizations of circular-harmonic decompositions for angular spectrum estimation are presented and a powerful test-statistic for rotation-invariant feature-detection in images is proposed. It is shown that pixel-domain realizations of the resulting finite impulse response (FIR) filters have a low computational complexity as a consequence of their separability and steerability. The chosen form also focuses the impulse response around the pixel-under test while ensuring adequate angular resolution after discretization. The novel test-statistic, involving angular integrals that are evaluated in the transform domain, is used to detect wedges, i.e. corners of arbitrary angle and unknown orientation, in synthetic and real imagery. Like traditional (t- and F-distributed) test statistics used in regression analysis, and unlike other rotationally invariant detectors, this similarity measure incorporates and considers uncertainty due to the limitations of finite sampling. 
### 30.Iris Recognition for Personal Identification using LAMSTAR neural network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12145.pdf)
>  Iris recognition is one of the most important biometric recognition method. This is because the iris texture provides many features such as freckles, coronas, stripes, furrows, crypts, etc. Those features are unique for different people and distinguishable. Such unique features in the anatomical structure of the iris make it possible the differentiation among individuals. So during last years huge number of people have been trying to improve its performance. In this article first different common steps for the Iris recognition system is explained. Then a special type of neural network is used for recognition part. Experimental results show high accuracy can be obtained especially when the primary steps are done well. 
### 31.An Empirical Study on Leveraging Scene Graphs for Visual Question Answering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12133.pdf)
>  Visual question answering (Visual QA) has attracted significant attention these years. While a variety of algorithms have been proposed, most of them are built upon different combinations of image and language features as well as multi-modal attention and fusion. In this paper, we investigate an alternative approach inspired by conventional QA systems that operate on knowledge graphs. Specifically, we investigate the use of scene graphs derived from images for Visual QA: an image is abstractly represented by a graph with nodes corresponding to object entities and edges to object relationships. We adapt the recently proposed graph network (GN) to encode the scene graph and perform structured reasoning according to the input question. Our empirical studies demonstrate that scene graphs can already capture essential information of images and graph networks have the potential to outperform state-of-the-art Visual QA algorithms but with a much cleaner architecture. By analyzing the features generated by GNs we can further interpret the reasoning process, suggesting a promising direction towards explainable Visual QA. 
### 32.It's All About The Scale -- Efficient Text Detection Using Adaptive Scaling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12122.pdf)
>  "Text can appear anywhere". This property requires us to carefully process all the pixels in an image in order to accurately localize all text instances. In particular, for the more difficult task of localizing small text regions, many methods use an enlarged image or even several rescaled ones as their input. This significantly increases the processing time of the entire image and needlessly enlarges background regions. If we were to have a prior telling us the coarse location of text instances in the image and their approximate scale, we could have adaptively chosen which regions to process and how to rescale them, thus significantly reducing the processing time. To estimate this prior we propose a segmentation-based network with an additional "scale predictor", an output channel that predicts the scale of each text segment. The network is applied on a scaled down image to efficiently approximate the desired prior, without processing all the pixels of the original image. The approximated prior is then used to create a compact image containing only text regions, resized to a canonical scale, which is fed again to the segmentation network for fine-grained detection. We show that our approach offers a powerful alternative to fixed scaling schemes, achieving an equivalent accuracy to larger input scales while processing far fewer pixels. Qualitative and quantitative results are presented on the ICDAR15 and ICDAR17 MLT benchmarks to validate our approach. 
### 33.Real-time Tracking-by-Detection of Human Motion in RGB-D Camera Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12112.pdf)
>  This paper presents a novel real-time tracking system capable of improving body pose estimation algorithms in distributed camera networks. The first stage of our approach introduces a linear Kalman filter operating at the body joints level, used to fuse single-view body poses coming from different detection nodes of the network and to ensure temporal consistency between them. The second stage, instead, refines the Kalman filter estimates by fitting a hierarchical model of the human body having constrained link sizes in order to ensure the physical consistency of the tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a broad experimental validation, performed on a set of sequences whose ground truth references are generated by a commercial marker-based motion capture system. The obtained results show how the proposed system outperforms the considered state-of-the-art approaches, granting accurate and reliable estimates. Moreover, the developed methodology constrains neither the number of persons to track, nor the number, position, synchronization, frame-rate, and manufacturer of the RGB-D cameras used. Finally, the real-time performances of the system are of paramount importance for a large number of real-world applications. 
### 34.FocusNet: Imbalanced Large and Small Organ Segmentation with an End-to-End Deep Neural Network for Head and Neck CT Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12056.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network for solving the problem of imbalanced large and small organ segmentation in head and neck (HaN) CT images. To conduct radiotherapy planning for nasopharyngeal cancer, more than 10 organs-at-risk (normal organs) need to be precisely segmented in advance. However, the size ratio between large and small organs in the head could reach hundreds. Directly using such imbalanced organ annotations to train deep neural networks generally leads to inaccurate small-organ label maps. We propose a novel end-to-end deep neural network to solve this challenging problem by automatically locating, ROI-pooling, and segmenting small organs with specifically designed small-organ sub-networks while maintaining the accuracy of large organ segmentation. A strong main network with densely connected atrous spatial pyramid pooling and squeeze-and-excitation modules is used for segmenting large organs, where large organs' label maps are directly output. For small organs, their probabilistic locations instead of label maps are estimated by the main network. High-resolution and multi-scale feature volumes for each small organ are ROI-pooled according to their locations and are fed into small-organ networks for accurate segmenting small organs. Our proposed network is extensively tested on both collected real data and the \emph{MICCAI Head and Neck Auto Segmentation Challenge 2015} dataset, and shows superior performance compared with state-of-the-art segmentation methods. 
### 35.Dilated Point Convolutions: On the Receptive Field of Point Convolutions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12046.pdf)
>  In this work, we propose Dilated Point Convolutions (DPC) which drastically increase the receptive field of convolutions on 3D point clouds. As we show in our experiments, the size of the receptive field is directly related to the performance of dense tasks such as semantic segmentation. We look at different network architectures and mechanisms to increase the receptive field size of point convolutions and propose in particular dilated point convolutions. Importantly, our dilation mechanism can easily be integrated into all existing methods using nearest-neighbor-based point convolutions. To evaluate the resulting network architectures, we visualize the receptive field and report competitive scores on the task of 3D semantic segmentation on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets. 
### 36.DAR-Net: Dynamic Aggregation Network for Semantic Scene Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12022.pdf)
>  Traditional grid/neighbor-based static pooling has become a constraint for point cloud geometry analysis. In this paper, we propose DAR-Net, a novel network architecture that focuses on dynamic feature aggregation. The central idea of DAR-Net is generating a self-adaptive pooling skeleton that considers both scene complexity and local geometry features. Providing variable semi-local receptive fields and weights, the skeleton serves as a bridge that connect local convolutional feature extractors and a global recurrent feature integrator. Experimental results on indoor scene datasets show advantages of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art architectures that adopt static pooling methods. 
### 37.Fairest of Them All: Establishing a Strong Baseline for Cross-Domain Person ReID  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12016.pdf)
>  Person re-identification (ReID) remains a very difficult challenge in computer vision, and critical for large-scale video surveillance scenarios where an individual could appear in different camera views at different times. There has been recent interest in tackling this challenge using cross-domain approaches, which leverages data from source domains that are different than the target domain. Such approaches are more practical for real-world widespread deployment given that they don't require on-site training (as with unsupervised or domain transfer approaches) or on-site manual annotation and training (as with supervised approaches). In this study, we take a systematic approach to establishing a large baseline source domain and target domain for cross-domain person ReID. We accomplish this by conducting a comprehensive analysis to study the similarities between source domains proposed in literature, and studying the effects of incrementally increasing the size of the source domain. This allows us to establish a balanced source domain and target domain split that promotes variety in both source and target domains. Furthermore, using lessons learned from the state-of-the-art supervised person re-identification methods, we establish a strong baseline method for cross-domain person ReID. Experiments show that a source domain composed of two of the largest person ReID domains (SYSU and MSMT) performs well across six commonly-used target domains. Furthermore, we show that, surprisingly, two of the recent commonly-used domains (PRID and GRID) have too few query images to provide meaningful insights. As such, based on our findings, we propose the following balanced baseline for cross-domain person ReID consisting of: i) a fixed multi-source domain consisting of SYSU, MSMT, Airport and 3DPeS, and ii) a multi-target domain consisting of Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, CUHK03, PRID, GRID and VIPeR. 
### 38.Optical Flow for Intermediate Frame Interpolation of Multispectral Geostationary Satellite Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12013.pdf)
>  Applications of satellite data in areas such as weather tracking and modeling, ecosystem monitoring, wildfire detection, and landcover change are heavily dependent on the trade-offs related to the spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions of the observations. For instance, geostationary weather tracking satellites are designed to take hemispherical snapshots many times throughout the day but sensor hardware limits data collection. In this work we tackle this limitation by developing a method for temporal upsampling of multi-spectral satellite imagery using optical flow video interpolation deep convolutional neural networks. The presented model, extends Super SloMo (SSM) from single optical flow estimates to multichannel where flows are computed per wavelength band. We apply this technique on up to 8 multispectral bands of GOES-R/Advanced Baseline Imager mesoscale dataset to temporally enhance full disk hemispheric snapshots from 15 minutes to 1 minute. Through extensive experimentation, we show SSM greatly outperforms the linear interpolation baseline and that multichannel optical flows improves performance on GOES/ABI. Furthermore, we discuss challenges and open questions related to temporal interpolation of multispectral geostationary satellite imagery. 
### 39.ROAM: Recurrently Optimizing Tracking Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12006.pdf)
>  In this paper, we design a tracking model consisting of response generation and bounding box regression, where the first component produces a heat map to indicate the presence of the object at different positions and the second part regresses the relative bounding box shifts to anchors mounted on sliding-window locations. Thanks to the resizable convolutional filters used in both components to adapt to the shape changes of objects, our tracking model does not need to enumerate different sized anchors, thus saving model parameters. To effectively adapt the model to appearance variations, we propose to offline train a recurrent neural optimizer to update tracking model in a meta-learning setting, which can converge the model in a few gradient steps. This improves the convergence speed of updating the tracking model while achieving better performance. Moreover, we also propose a simple yet effective training trick called Random Filter Scaling to prevent overfitting, which boosts the generalization performance greatly. Finally, we extensively evaluate our trackers, ROAM and ROAM++, on the OTB, VOT, LaSOT, GOT-10K and TrackingNet benchmark and our methods perform favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms. 
### 40.Learning Wear Patterns on Footwear Outsoles Using Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12005.pdf)
>  Footwear outsoles acquire characteristics unique to the individual wearing them over time. Forensic scientists largely rely on their skills and knowledge, gained through years of experience, to analyse such characteristics on a shoeprint. In this work, we present a convolutional neural network model that can predict the wear pattern on a unique dataset of shoeprints that captures the life and wear of a pair of shoes. We present an additional architecture able to reconstruct the outsole back to its original state on a given week, and provide empirical evaluations of the performance of both models. 
### 41.Attribute-Guided Deep Polarimetric Thermal-to-visible Face Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11980.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present an attribute-guided deep coupled learning framework to address the problem of matching polarimetric thermal face photos against a gallery of visible faces. The coupled framework contains two sub-networks, one dedicated to the visible spectrum and the second sub-network dedicated to the polarimetric thermal spectrum. Each sub-network is made of a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture. We propose a novel Attribute-Guided Coupled Generative Adversarial Network (AGC-GAN) architecture which utilizes facial attributes to improve the thermal-to-visible face recognition performance. The proposed AGC-GAN exploits the facial attributes and leverages multiple loss functions in order to learn rich discriminative features in a common embedding subspace. To achieve a realistic photo reconstruction while preserving the discriminative information, we also add a perceptual loss term to the coupling loss function. An ablation study is performed to show the effectiveness of different loss functions for optimizing the proposed method. Moreover, the superiority of the model compared to the state-of-the-art models is demonstrated using polarimetric dataset. 
### 42.Learning Body Shape and Pose from Dense Correspondences  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11955.pdf)
>  In this paper, we address the problem of learning 3D human pose and body shape from 2D image dataset, without having to use 3D dataset (body shape and pose). The idea is to use dense correspondences between image points and a body surface, which can be annotated on in-the wild 2D images, and extract and aggregate 3D information from them. To do so, we propose a training strategy called ``deform-and-learn" where we alternate deformable surface registration and training of deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require 3D pose annotations from a motion capture (MoCap) system or human intervention to validate 3D pose annotations. 
### 43.Segmenting Hyperspectral Images Using Spectral-Spatial Convolutional Neural Networks With Training-Time Data Augmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11935.pdf)
>  Hyperspectral imaging provides detailed information about the scanned objects, as it captures their spectral characteristics within a large number of wavelength bands. Classification of such data has become an active research topic due to its wide applicability in a variety of fields. Deep learning has established the state of the art in the area, and it constitutes the current research mainstream. In this letter, we introduce a new spectral-spatial convolutional neural network, benefitting from a battery of data augmentation techniques which help deal with a real-life problem of lacking ground-truth training data. Our rigorous experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms other spectral-spatial techniques from the literature, and delivers precise hyperspectral classification in real time. 
### 44.MaskGAN: Towards Diverse and Interactive Facial Image Manipulation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11922.pdf)
>  Facial image manipulation has achieved great progresses in recent years. However, previous methods either operate on a predefined set of face attributes or leave users little freedom to interactively manipulate images. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel framework termed MaskGAN, enabling diverse and interactive face manipulation. Our key insight is that semantic masks serve as a suitable intermediate representation for flexible face manipulation with fidelity preservation. MaskGAN has two main components: 1) Dense Mapping Network, and 2) Editing Behavior Simulated Training. Specifically, Dense mapping network learns style mapping between a free-form user modified mask and a target image, enabling diverse generation results. Editing behavior simulated training models the user editing behavior on the source mask, making the overall framework more robust to various manipulated inputs. To facilitate extensive studies, we construct a large-scale high-resolution face dataset with fine-grained mask annotations named CelebAMask-HQ. MaskGAN is comprehensively evaluated on two challenging tasks: attribute transfer and style copy, demonstrating superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods. The code, models and dataset are available at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/switchablenorms/CelebAMask-HQ" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}. 
### 45.Remote Heart Rate Measurement from Highly Compressed Facial Videos: an End-to-end Deep Learning Solution with Video Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11921.pdf)
>  Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which aims at measuring heart activities without any contact, has great potential in many applications (e.g., remote healthcare). Existing rPPG approaches rely on analyzing very fine details of facial videos, which are prone to be affected by video compression. Here we propose a two-stage, end-to-end method using hidden rPPG information enhancement and attention networks, which is the first attempt to counter video compression loss and recover rPPG signals from highly compressed videos. The method includes two parts: 1) a Spatio-Temporal Video Enhancement Network (STVEN) for video enhancement, and 2) an rPPG network (rPPGNet) for rPPG signal recovery. The rPPGNet can work on its own for robust rPPG measurement, and the STVEN network can be added and jointly trained to further boost the performance especially on highly compressed videos. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets to show that, 1) the proposed method not only achieves superior performance on compressed videos with high-quality videos pair, 2) it also generalizes well on novel data with only compressed videos available, which implies the promising potential for real world applications. 
### 46.Triangulation: Why Optimize?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11917.pdf)
>  For decades, it has been widely accepted that the gold standard for two-view triangulation is to minimize the cost based on reprojection errors. In this work, we challenge this idea. We propose a novel alternative to the classic midpoint method that leads to significantly lower 2D errors and parallax errors. It provides a numerically stable closed-form solution based solely on a pair of backprojected rays. Since our solution is rotationally invariant, it can also be applied for fisheye and omnidirectional cameras. We show that for small parallax angles, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of combined 2D, 3D and parallax accuracy, while achieving comparable speed. 
### 47.Rethinking Classification and Localization for Cascade R-CNN  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11914.pdf)
>  We extend the state-of-the-art Cascade R-CNN with a simple feature sharing mechanism. Our approach focuses on the performance increases on high IoU but decreases on low IoU thresholds--a key problem this detector suffers from. Feature sharing is extremely helpful, our results show that given this mechanism embedded into all stages, we can easily narrow the gap between the last stage and preceding stages on low IoU thresholds without resorting to the commonly used testing ensemble but the network itself. We also observe obvious improvements on all IoU thresholds benefited from feature sharing, and the resulting cascade structure can easily match or exceed its counterparts, only with negligible extra parameters introduced. To push the envelope, we demonstrate 43.2 AP on COCO object detection without any bells and whistles including testing ensemble, surpassing previous Cascade R-CNN by a large margin. Our framework is easy to implement and we hope it can serve as a general and strong baseline for future research. 
### 48.Semantic Guided Single Image Reflection Removal  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11912.pdf)
>  Reflection is common in images capturing scenes behind a glass window, which is not only a disturbance visually but also influence the performance of other computer vision algorithms. Single image reflection removal is an ill-posed problem because the color at each pixel needs to be separated into two values, i.e., the desired clear background and the reflection. To solve it, existing methods propose priors such as smoothness, color consistency. However, the low-level priors are not reliable in complex scenes, for instance, when capturing a real outdoor scene through a window, both the foreground and background contain both smooth and sharp area and a variety of color. In this paper, inspired by the fact that human can separate the two layers easily by recognizing the objects, we use the object semantic as guidance to force the same semantic object belong to the same layer. Extensive experiments on different datasets show that adding the semantic information offers a significant improvement to reflection separation. We also demonstrate the applications of the proposed method to other computer vision tasks. 
### 49.Context Model for Pedestrian Intention Prediction using Factored Latent-Dynamic Conditional Random Fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11881.pdf)
>  Smooth handling of pedestrian interactions is a key requirement for Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Such systems call for early and accurate prediction of a pedestrian's crossing/not-crossing behaviour in front of the vehicle. Existing approaches to pedestrian behaviour prediction make use of pedestrian motion, his/her location in a scene and static context variables such as traffic lights, zebra crossings etc. We stress on the necessity of early prediction for smooth operation of such systems. We introduce the influence of vehicle interactions on pedestrian intention for this purpose. In this paper, we show a discernible advance in prediction time aided by the inclusion of such vehicle interaction context. We apply our methods to two different datasets, one in-house collected - NTU dataset and another public real-life benchmark - JAAD dataset. We also propose a generic graphical model Factored Latent-Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (FLDCRF) for single and multi-label sequence prediction as well as joint interaction modeling tasks. FLDCRF outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks across the datasets ($\sim$100 sequences per dataset) over identical time-series features. While the existing best system predicts pedestrian stopping behaviour with 70\% accuracy 0.38 seconds before the actual events, our system achieves such accuracy at least 0.9 seconds on an average before the actual events across datasets. 
### 50.Blind Deblurring Using GANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11880.pdf)
>  Deblurring is the task of restoring a blurred image to a sharp one, retrieving the information lost due to the blur. In blind deblurring we have no information regarding the blur kernel. As deblurring can be considered as an image to image translation task, deep learning based solutions, including the ones which use GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), have been proven effective for deblurring. Most of them have an encoder-decoder structure. Our objective is to try different GAN structures and improve its performance through various modifications to the existing structure for supervised deblurring. In supervised deblurring we have pairs of blurred and their corresponding sharp images, while in the unsupervised case we have a set of blurred and sharp images but their is no correspondence between them. Modifications to the structures is done to improve the global perception of the model. As blur is non-uniform in nature, for deblurring we require global information of the entire image, whereas convolution used in CNN is able to provide only local perception. Deep models can be used to improve global perception but due to large number of parameters it becomes difficult for it to converge and inference time increases, to solve this we propose the use of attention module (non-local block) which was previously used in language translation and other image to image translation tasks in deblurring. Use of residual connection also improves the performance of deblurring as features from the lower layers are added to the upper layers of the model. It has been found that classical losses like L1, L2, and perceptual loss also help in training of GANs when added together with adversarial loss. We also concatenate edge information of the image to observe its effects on deblurring. We also use feedback modules to retain long term dependencies 
### 51.A Benchmark on Tricks for Large-scale Image Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11854.pdf)
>  Many studies have been performed on metric learning, which has become a key ingredient in top-performing methods of instance-level image retrieval. Meanwhile, less attention has been paid to pre-processing and post-processing tricks that can significantly boost performance. Furthermore, we found that most previous studies used small scale datasets to simplify processing. Because the behavior of a feature representation in a deep learning model depends on both domain and data, it is important to understand how model behave in large-scale environments when a proper combination of retrieval tricks is used. In this paper, we extensively analyze the effect of well-known pre-processing, post-processing tricks, and their combination for large-scale image retrieval. We found that proper use of these tricks can significantly improve model performance without necessitating complex architecture or introducing loss, as confirmed by achieving a competitive result on the Google Landmark Retrieval Challenge 2019. 
### 52.Genetic Deep Learning for Lung Cancer Screening  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11849.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great promise in improving computer aided detection (CADe). From classifying tumors found via mammography as benign or malignant to automated detection of colorectal polyps in CT colonography, these advances have helped reduce the need for further evaluation with invasive testing and prevent errors from missed diagnoses by acting as a second observer in today's fast paced and high volume clinical environment. CADe methods have become faster and more precise thanks to innovations in deep learning over the past several years. With advancements such as the inception module and utilization of residual connections, the approach to designing CNN architectures has become an art. It is customary to use proven models and fine tune them for particular tasks given a dataset, often requiring tedious work. We investigated using a genetic algorithm (GA) to conduct a neural architectural search (NAS) to generate a novel CNN architecture to find early stage lung cancer in chest x-rays (CXR). Using a dataset of over twelve thousand biopsy proven cases of lung cancer, the trained classification model achieved an accuracy of 97.15% with a PPV of 99.88% and a NPV of 94.81%, beating models such as Inception-V3 and ResNet-152 while simultaneously reducing the number of parameters a factor of 4 and 14, respectively. 
### 53.Learning Instance-wise Sparsity for Accelerating Deep Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11840.pdf)
>  Exploring deep convolutional neural networks of high efficiency and low memory usage is very essential for a wide variety of machine learning tasks. Most of existing approaches used to accelerate deep models by manipulating parameters or filters without data, e.g., pruning and decomposition. In contrast, we study this problem from a different perspective by respecting the difference between data. An instance-wise feature pruning is developed by identifying informative features for different instances. Specifically, by investigating a feature decay regularization, we expect intermediate feature maps of each instance in deep neural networks to be sparse while preserving the overall network performance. During online inference, subtle features of input images extracted by intermediate layers of a well-trained neural network can be eliminated to accelerate the subsequent calculations. We further take coefficient of variation as a measure to select the layers that are appropriate for acceleration. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets and networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
### 54.Attribute Aware Pooling for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11837.pdf)
>  This paper expands the strength of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the pedestrian attribute recognition problem by devising a novel attribute aware pooling algorithm. Existing vanilla CNNs cannot be straightforwardly applied to handle multi-attribute data because of the larger label space as well as the attribute entanglement and correlations. We tackle these challenges that hampers the development of CNNs for multi-attribute classification by fully exploiting the correlation between different attributes. The multi-branch architecture is adopted for fucusing on attributes at different regions. Besides the prediction based on each branch itself, context information of each branch are employed for decision as well. The attribute aware pooling is developed to integrate both kinds of information. Therefore, attributes which are indistinct or tangled with others can be accurately recognized by exploiting the context information. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed pooling method appropriately explores and exploits the correlations between attributes for the pedestrian attribute recognition. 
### 55.Pick-and-Learn: Automatic Quality Evaluation for Noisy-Labeled Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11835.pdf)
>  Deep learning methods have achieved promising performance in many areas, but they are still struggling with noisy-labeled images during the training process. Considering that the annotation quality indispensably relies on great expertise, the problem is even more crucial in the medical image domain. How to eliminate the disturbance from noisy labels for segmentation tasks without further annotations is still a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce our label quality evaluation strategy for deep neural networks automatically assessing the quality of each label, which is not explicitly provided, and training on clean-annotated ones. We propose a solution for network automatically evaluating the relative quality of the labels in the training set and using good ones to tune the network parameters. We also design an overfitting control module to let the network maximally learn from the precise annotations during the training process. Experiments on the public biomedical image segmentation dataset have proved the method outperforms baseline methods and retains both high accuracy and good generalization at different noise levels. 
### 56.Hybrid-Attention based Decoupled Metric Learning for Zero-Shot Image Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11832.pdf)
>  In zero-shot image retrieval (ZSIR) task, embedding learning becomes more attractive, however, many methods follow the traditional metric learning idea and omit the problems behind zero-shot settings. In this paper, we first emphasize the importance of learning visual discriminative metric and preventing the partial/selective learning behavior of learner in ZSIR, and then propose the Decoupled Metric Learning (DeML) framework to achieve these individually. Instead of coarsely optimizing an unified metric, we decouple it into multiple attention-specific parts so as to recurrently induce the discrimination and explicitly enhance the generalization. And they are mainly achieved by our object-attention module based on random walk graph propagation and the channel-attention module based on the adversary constraint, respectively. We demonstrate the necessity of addressing the vital problems in ZSIR on the popular benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-theart methods by a significant margin.

### 57.Reprojection R-CNN: A Fast and Accurate Object Detector for 360° Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11830.pdf)
>  360° images are usually represented in either equirectangular projection (ERP) or multiple perspective projections. Different from the flat 2D images, the detection task is challenging for 360° images due to the distortion of ERP and the inefficiency of perspective projections. However, existing methods mostly focus on one of the above representations instead of both, leading to limited detection performance. Moreover, the lack of appropriate bounding-box annotations as well as the annotated datasets further increases the difficulties of the detection task. In this paper, we present a standard object detection framework for 360° images. Specifically, we adapt the terminologies of the traditional object detection task to the omnidirectional scenarios, and propose a novel two-stage object detector, i.e., Reprojection R-CNN by combining both ERP and perspective projection. Owing to the omnidirectional field-of-view of ERP, Reprojection R-CNN first generates coarse region proposals efficiently by a distortion-aware spherical region proposal network. Then, it leverages the distortion-free perspective projection and refines the proposed regions by a novel reprojection network. We construct two novel synthetic datasets for training and evaluation. Experiments reveal that Reprojection R-CNN outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on the mAP metric. In addition, the proposed detector could run at 178ms per image in the panoramic datasets, which implies its practicability in real-world applications. 
### 58.Forced Spatial Attention for Driver Foot Activity Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11824.pdf)
>  This paper provides a simple solution for reliably solving image classification tasks tied to spatial locations of salient objects in the scene. Unlike conventional image classification approaches that are designed to be invariant to translations of objects in the scene, we focus on tasks where the output classes vary with respect to where an object of interest is situated within an image. To handle this variant of the image classification task, we propose augmenting the standard cross-entropy (classification) loss with a domain dependent Forced Spatial Attention (FSA) loss, which in essence compels the network to attend to specific regions in the image associated with the desired output class. To demonstrate the utility of this loss function, we consider the task of driver foot activity classification - where each activity is strongly correlated with where the driver's foot is in the scene. Training with our proposed loss function results in significantly improved accuracies, better generalization, and robustness against noise, while obviating the need for very large datasets. 
### 59.Quadtree Generating Networks: Efficient Hierarchical Scene Parsing with Sparse Convolutions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11821.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation with Convolutional Neural Networks is a memory-intensive task due to the high spatial resolution of feature maps and output predictions. In this paper, we present Quadtree Generating Networks (QGNs), a novel approach able to drastically reduce the memory footprint of modern semantic segmentation networks. The key idea is to use quadtrees to represent the predictions and target segmentation masks instead of dense pixel grids. Our quadtree representation enables hierarchical processing of an input image, with the most computationally demanding layers only being used at regions in the image containing boundaries between classes. In addition, given a trained model, our representation enables flexible inference schemes to trade-off accuracy and computational cost, allowing the network to adapt in constrained situations such as embedded devices. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the Cityscapes, SUN-RGBD and ADE20k datasets. On Cityscapes, we obtain an relative 3% mIoU improvement compared to a dilated network with similar memory consumption; and only receive a 3% relative mIoU drop compared to a large dilated network, while reducing memory consumption by over 4$\times$. 
### 60.Grape detection, segmentation and tracking using deep neural networks and three-dimensional association  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11819.pdf)
>  Agricultural applications as yield prediction, precision agriculture and automated harvesting need systems able to infer the culture state from low cost sensing devices. Proximal sensing using affordable cameras combined to computer vision have seen a promising alternative, strengthened after the advent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an alternative for challenging pattern recognition problems in natural images. Considering fruit growing monitoring and automation, a fundamental problem is the detection, segmentation and counting of individual fruits in orchards. Here we show that for grape wines, a crop presenting large variability in shape, color, size and compactness, grape clusters can be successfully detected, segmented and tracked using state-of-the-art CNNs. In a dataset containing 408 grape clusters from images taken on field, we have reached a F1-score up to 0.91 for instance segmentation, a fine separation of each cluster from other structures in the image that allows a more accurate assessment of fruit size and shape. We have also shown as clusters can be identified and tracked along video sequences recording orchards rows. We also present a public dataset containing grape clusters properly annotated in 300 images and a novel annotation methodology for segmentation of complex objects in natural images. The presented pipeline for annotation, training, evaluation and tracking of agricultural patterns in images can be replicated for different crops and production systems. It can be employed on the development of sensing components for several agricultural and environmental applications. 
### 61.VITAL: A Visual Interpretation on Text with Adversarial Learning for Image Labeling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11811.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a novel way to interpret text information by extracting visual feature presentation from multiple high-resolution and photo-realistic synthetic images generated by Text-to-image Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to improve the performance of image labeling. Firstly, we design a stacked Generative Multi-Adversarial Network (GMAN), StackGMAN++, a modified version of the current state-of-the-art Text-to-image GAN, StackGAN++, to generate multiple synthetic images with various prior noises conditioned on a text. And then we extract deep visual features from the generated synthetic images to explore the underlying visual concepts for text. Finally, we combine image-level visual feature, text-level feature and visual features based on synthetic images together to predict labels for images. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets and the experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach. 
### 62.To Learn or Not to Learn: Analyzing the Role of Learning for Navigation in Virtual Environments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11770.pdf)
>  In this paper we compare learning-based methods and classical methods for navigation in virtual environments. We construct classical navigation agents and demonstrate that they outperform state-of-the-art learning-based agents on two standard benchmarks: MINOS and Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Spaces. We perform detailed analysis to study the strengths and weaknesses of learned agents and classical agents, as well as how characteristics of the virtual environment impact navigation performance. Our results show that learned agents have inferior collision avoidance and memory management, but are superior in handling ambiguity and noise. These results can inform future design of navigation agents. 
### 63.Tell Me What to Track  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11751.pdf)
>  In recent years, deep-learning-based visual object trackers have been studied thoroughly, but handling occlusions and/or rapid motion of the target remains challenging. In this work, we argue that conditioning on the natural language (NL) description of a target provides information for longer-term invariance, and thus helps cope with typical tracking challenges. However, deriving a formulation to combine the strengths of appearance-based tracking with the language modality is not straightforward. We propose a novel deep tracking-by-detection formulation that can take advantage of NL descriptions. Regions that are related to the given NL description are generated by a proposal network during the detection phase of the tracker. Our LSTM based tracker then predicts the update of the target from regions proposed by the NL based detection phase. In benchmarks, our method is competitive with state of the art trackers, while it outperforms all other trackers on targets with unambiguous and precise language annotations. It also beats the state-of-the-art NL tracker when initializing without a bounding box. Our method runs at over 30 fps on a single GPU. 
### 64.Accurate and Robust Pulmonary Nodule Detection by 3D Feature Pyramid Network with Self-supervised Feature Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11704.pdf)
>  Accurate detection of pulmonary nodules with high sensitivity and specificity is essential for automatic lung cancer diagnosis from CT scans. Although many deep learning-based algorithms make great progress for improving the accuracy of nodule detection, the high false positive rate is still a challenging problem which limits the automatic diagnosis in routine clinical practice. Moreover, the CT scans collected from multiple manufacturers may affect the robustness of Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) due to the differences in intensity scales and machine noises. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning assisted pulmonary nodule detection framework based on a 3D Feature Pyramid Network (3DFPN) to improve the sensitivity of nodule detection by employing multi-scale features to increase the resolution of nodules, as well as a parallel top-down path to transit the high-level semantic features to complement low-level general features. Furthermore, a High Sensitivity and Specificity (HS2) network is introduced to eliminate the false positive nodule candidates by tracking the appearance changes in continuous CT slices of each nodule candidate on Location History Images (LHI). In addition, in order to improve the performance consistency of the proposed framework across data captured by different CT scanners without using additional annotations, an effective self-supervised learning schema is applied to learn spatiotemporal features of CT scans from large-scale unlabeled data. The performance and robustness of our method are evaluated on several publicly available datasets with significant performance improvements. The proposed framework is able to accurately detect pulmonary nodules with high sensitivity and specificity and achieves 90.6% sensitivity with 1/8 false positive per scan which outperforms the state-of-the-art results 15.8% on LUNA16 dataset. 
### 65.Automated Lesion Detection by Regressing Intensity-Based Distance with a Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12452.pdf)
>  Localization of focal vascular lesions on brain MRI is an important component of research on the etiology of neurological disorders. However, manual annotation of lesions can be challenging, time-consuming and subject to observer bias. Automated detection methods often need voxel-wise annotations for training. We propose a novel approach for automated lesion detection that can be trained on scans only annotated with a dot per lesion instead of a full segmentation. From the dot annotations and their corresponding intensity images we compute various distance maps (DMs), indicating the distance to a lesion based on spatial distance, intensity distance, or both. We train a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) to predict these DMs for unseen intensity images. The local optima in the predicted DMs are expected to correspond to lesion locations. We show the potential of this approach to detect enlarged perivascular spaces in white matter on a large brain MRI dataset with an independent test set of 1000 scans. Our method matches the intra-rater performance of the expert rater that was computed on an independent set. We compare the different types of distance maps, showing that incorporating intensity information in the distance maps used to train an FCN greatly improves performance. 
### 66.Solving the Robot-World Hand-Eye(s) Calibration Problem with Iterative Methods  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12425.pdf)
>  Robot-world, hand-eye calibration is the problem of determining the transformation between the robot end-effector and a camera, as well as the transformation between the robot base and the world coordinate system. This relationship has been modeled as $\mathbf{AX}=\mathbf{ZB}$, where $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ are unknown homogeneous transformation matrices. The successful execution of many robot manipulation tasks depends on determining these matrices accurately, and we are particularly interested in the use of calibration for use in vision tasks. In this work, we describe a collection of methods consisting of two cost function classes, three different parameterizations of rotation components, and separable versus simultaneous formulations. We explore the behavior of this collection of methods on real datasets and simulated datasets, and compare to seven other state-of-the-art methods. Our collection of methods return greater accuracy on many metrics as compared to the state-of-the-art. The collection of methods is extended to the problem of robot-world hand-multiple-eye calibration, and results are shown with two and three cameras mounted on the same robot. 
### 67.Solar Image Restoration with the Cycle-GAN Based on Multi-Fractal Properties of Texture Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12192.pdf)
>  Texture is one of the most obvious characteristics in solar images and it is normally described by texture features. Because textures from solar images of the same wavelength are similar, we assume texture features of solar images are multi-fractals. Based on this assumption, we propose a pure data-based image restoration method: with several high resolution solar images as references, we use the Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network to restore burred images of the same steady physical process, in the same wavelength obtained by the same telescope. We test our method with simulated and real observation data and find that our method can improve the spatial resolution of solar images, without loss of any frames. Because our method does not need paired training set or additional instruments, it can be used as a post-processing method for solar images obtained by either seeing limited telescopes or telescopes with ground layer adaptive optic system. 
### 68.Charting the Right Manifold: Manifold Mixup for Few-shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12087.pdf)
>  Few-shot learning algorithms aim to learn model parameters capable of adapting to unseen classes with the help of only a few labeled examples. A recent regularization technique - Manifold Mixup focuses on learning a general-purpose representation, robust to small changes in the data distribution. Since the goal of few-shot learning is closely linked to robust representation learning, we study Manifold Mixup in this problem setting. Self-supervised learning is another technique that learns semantically meaningful features, using only the inherent structure of the data. This work investigates the role of learning relevant feature manifold for few-shot tasks using self-supervision and regularization techniques. We observe that regularizing the feature manifold, enriched via self-supervised techniques, with Manifold Mixup significantly improves few-shot learning performance. We show that our proposed method S2M2 beats the current state-of-the-art accuracy on standard few-shot learning datasets like CIFAR-FS, CUB and mini-ImageNet by 3-8%. Through extensive experimentation, we show that the features learned using our approach generalize to complex few-shot evaluation tasks, cross-domain scenarios and are robust against slight changes to data distribution. 
### 69.Two-Stream CNN with Loose Pair Training for Multi-modal AMD Categorization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12023.pdf)
>  This paper studies automated categorization of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) given a multi-modal input, which consists of a color fundus image and an optical coherence tomography (OCT) image from a specific eye. Previous work uses a traditional method, comprised of feature extraction and classifier training that cannot be optimized jointly. By contrast, we propose a two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) that is end-to-end. The CNN's fusion layer is tailored to the need of fusing information from the fundus and OCT streams. For generating more multi-modal training instances, we introduce Loose Pair training, where a fundus image and an OCT image are paired based on class labels rather than eyes. Moreover, for a visual interpretation of how the individual modalities make contributions, we extend the class activation mapping technique to the multi-modal scenario. Experiments on a real-world dataset collected from an outpatient clinic justify the viability of our proposal for multi-modal AMD categorization. 
### 70.What Should I Ask? Using Conversationally Informative Rewards for Goal-Oriented Visual Dialog  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12021.pdf)
>  The ability to engage in goal-oriented conversations has allowed humans to gain knowledge, reduce uncertainty, and perform tasks more efficiently. Artificial agents, however, are still far behind humans in having goal-driven conversations. In this work, we focus on the task of goal-oriented visual dialogue, aiming to automatically generate a series of questions about an image with a single objective. This task is challenging since these questions must not only be consistent with a strategy to achieve a goal, but also consider the contextual information in the image. We propose an end-to-end goal-oriented visual dialogue system, that combines reinforcement learning with regularized information gain. Unlike previous approaches that have been proposed for the task, our work is motivated by the Rational Speech Act framework, which models the process of human inquiry to reach a goal. We test the two versions of our model on the GuessWhat?! dataset, obtaining significant results that outperform the current state-of-the-art models in the task of generating questions to find an undisclosed object in an image. 
### 71.Learnable Parameter Similarity  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11943.pdf)
>  Most of the existing approaches focus on specific visual tasks while ignoring the relations between them. Estimating task relation sheds light on the learning of high-order semantic concepts, e.g., transfer learning. How to reveal the underlying relations between different visual tasks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{L}earnable \textbf{P}arameter \textbf{S}imilarity (\textbf{LPS}) method that learns an effective metric to measure the similarity of second-order semantics hidden in trained models. LPS is achieved by using a second-order neural network to align high-dimensional model parameters and learning second-order similarity in an end-to-end way. In addition, we create a model set called ModelSet500 as a parameter similarity learning benchmark that contains 500 trained models. Extensive experiments on ModelSet500 validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code will be released at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/Wanggcong/learnable-parameter-similarity" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}. 
### 72.Deep learning-based prediction of kinetic parameters from myocardial perfusion MRI  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11899.pdf)
>  The quantification of myocardial perfusion MRI has the potential to provide a fast, automated and user-independent assessment of myocardial ischaemia. However, due to the relatively high noise level and low temporal resolution of the acquired data and the complexity of the tracer-kinetic models, the model fitting can yield unreliable parameter estimates. A solution to this problem is the use of Bayesian inference which can incorporate prior knowledge and improve the reliability of the parameter estimation. This, however, uses Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the posterior distribution of the kinetic parameters which is extremely time intensive. This work proposes training convolutional networks to directly predict the kinetic parameters from the signal-intensity curves that are trained using estimates obtained from the Bayesian inference. This allows fast estimation of the kinetic parameters with a similar performance to the Bayesian inference. 
### 73.Effective and efficient ROI-wise visual encoding using an end-to-end CNN regression model and selective optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11885.pdf)
>  Recently, visual encoding based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have realized many achievements with the rapid development of deep network computation. Visual encoding model is aimed at predicting brain activity in response to presented image stimuli. Currently, visual encoding is accomplished mainly by firstly extracting image features through convolutional neural network (CNN) model pre-trained on computer vision task, and secondly training a linear regression model to map specific layer of CNN features to each voxel, namely voxel-wise encoding. However, the two-step manner model, essentially, is hard to determine which kind of well features are well linearly matched for beforehand unknown fMRI data with little understanding of human visual representation. Analogizing computer vision mostly related human vision, we proposed the end-to-end convolution regression model (ETECRM) in the region of interest (ROI)-wise manner to accomplish effective and efficient visual encoding. The end-to-end manner was introduced to make the model automatically learn better matching features to improve encoding performance. The ROI-wise manner was used to improve the encoding efficiency for many voxels. In addition, we designed the selective optimization including self-adapting weight learning and weighted correlation loss, noise regularization to avoid interfering of ineffective voxels in ROI-wise encoding. Experiment demonstrated that the proposed model obtained better predicting accuracy than the two-step manner of encoding models. Comparative analysis implied that end-to-end manner and large volume of fMRI data may drive the future development of visual encoding. 
### 74.Generative Adversarial Network for Handwritten Text  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11845.pdf)
>  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have proven hugely successful in variety of applications of image processing. However, generative adversarial networks for handwriting is relatively rare somehow because of difficulty of handling sequential handwriting data by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In this paper, we propose a handwriting generative adversarial network framework (HWGANs) for synthesizing handwritten stroke data. The main features of the new framework include: (i) A discriminator consists of an integrated CNN-Long-Short-Term- Memory (LSTM) based feature extraction with Path Signature Features (PSF) as input and a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) based binary classifier; (ii) A recurrent latent variable model as generator for synthesizing sequential handwritten data. The numerical experiments show the effectivity of the new model. Moreover, comparing with sole handwriting generator, the HWGANs synthesize more natural and realistic handwritten text. 
### 75.Momentum-Net: Fast and convergent iterative neural network for inverse problems  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11818.pdf)
>  Iterative neural networks (INN) are rapidly gaining attention for solving inverse problems in imaging, image processing, and computer vision. INNs combine regression NNs and an iterative model-based image reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm, leading to both good generalization capability and outperforming reconstruction quality over existing MBIR optimization models. This paper proposes the first fast and convergent INN architecture, Momentum-Net, by generalizing a block-wise MBIR algorithm that uses momentums and majorizers with regression NNs. For fast MBIR, Momentum-Net uses momentum terms in extrapolation modules, and noniterative MBIR modules at each layer by using majorizers, where each layer of Momentum-Net consists of three core modules: image refining, extrapolation, and MBIR. Momentum-Net guarantees convergence to a fixed-point for general differentiable (non)convex MBIR functions (or data-fit terms) and convex feasible sets, under two asymptomatic conditions. To consider data-fit variations across training and testing samples, we also propose a regularization parameter selection scheme based on the spectral radius of majorization matrices. Numerical experiments for light-field photography using a focal stack and sparse-view computational tomography demonstrate that given identical regression NN architectures, Momentum-Net significantly improves MBIR speed and accuracy over several existing INNs; it significantly improves reconstruction quality compared to a state-of-the-art MBIR method in each application. 
### 76.Memory- and Communication-Aware Model Compression for Distributed Deep Learning Inference on IoT  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11804.pdf)
>  Model compression has emerged as an important area of research for deploying deep learning models on Internet-of-Things (IoT). However, for extremely memory-constrained scenarios, even the compressed models cannot fit within the memory of a single device and, as a result, must be distributed across multiple devices. This leads to a distributed inference paradigm in which memory and communication costs represent a major bottleneck. Yet, existing model compression techniques are not communication-aware. Therefore, we propose Network of Neural Networks (NoNN), a new distributed IoT learning paradigm that compresses a large pretrained 'teacher' deep network into several disjoint and highly-compressed 'student' modules, without loss of accuracy. Moreover, we propose a network science-based knowledge partitioning algorithm for the teacher model, and then train individual students on the resulting disjoint partitions. Extensive experimentation on five image classification datasets, for user-defined memory/performance budgets, show that NoNN achieves higher accuracy than several baselines and similar accuracy as the teacher model, while using minimal communication among students. Finally, as a case study, we deploy the proposed model for CIFAR-10 dataset on edge devices and demonstrate significant improvements in memory footprint (up to 24x), performance (up to 12x), and energy per node (up to 14x) compared to the large teacher model. We further show that for distributed inference on multiple edge devices, our proposed NoNN model results in up to 33x reduction in total latency w.r.t. a state-of-the-art model compression baseline. 
### 77.Deep MRI Reconstruction: Unrolled Optimization Algorithms Meet Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11711.pdf)
>  Image reconstruction from undersampled k-space data has been playing an important role for fast MRI. Recently, deep learning has demonstrated tremendous success in various fields and also shown potential to significantly speed up MR reconstruction with reduced measurements. This article gives an overview of deep learning-based image reconstruction methods for MRI. Three types of deep learning-based approaches are reviewed, the data-driven, model-driven and integrated approaches. The main structure of each network in three approaches is explained and the analysis of common parts of reviewed networks and differences in-between are highlighted. Based on the review, a number of signal processing issues are discussed for maximizing the potential of deep reconstruction for fast MRI. the discussion may facilitate further development of "optimal" network and performance analysis from a theoretical point of view.
