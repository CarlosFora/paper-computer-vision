### 1.MV-YOLO: Motion Vector-aided Tracking by Semantic Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00107.pdf)
> Object tracking is the cornerstone of many visual analytics systems. While considerable progress has been made in this area in recent years, robust, efficient, and accurate tracking in real-world video remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a hybrid tracker that leverages motion information from the compressed video stream and a general-purpose semantic object detector acting on decoded frames to construct a fast and efficient tracking engine. The proposed approach is compared with several well-known recent trackers on the OTB tracking dataset. The results indicate advantages of the proposed method in terms of speed and/or accuracy.Other desirable features of the proposed method are its simplicity and deployment efficiency, which stems from the fact that it reuses the resources and information that may already exist in the system for other reasons. 
### 2.A Canonical Image Set for Examining and Comparing Image Processing  Algorithms [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00116.pdf)
> The purpose of this paper is to introduce a set of four test images containing features and structures that can facilitate effective examination and comparison of image processing algorithms. More specifically, the images are designed to more explicitly expose the characteristic properties of algorithms for image compression, virtual resolution adjustment, and enhancement. This set was developed at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in the late 1990s as a more rigorous alternative to Lena and other images that have come into common use for purely ad hoc reasons with little or no rigorous consideration of their suitability. The increasing number of test images appearing in the literature not only makes it more difficult to compare results from different papers, it also introduces the potential for cherry-picking to influence results. The key contribution of this paper is the proposal to establish {\em some} canonical set to ensure that published results can be analyzed and compared in a rigorous way from one paper to another, and consideration of the four NRL images is proposed for this purpose. 
### 3.CrowdHuman: A Benchmark for Detecting Human in a Crowd [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00123.pdf)
> Human detection has witnessed impressive progress in recent years. However, the occlusion issue of detecting human in highly crowded environments is far from solved. To make matters worse, crowd scenarios are still under-represented in current human detection benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, called CrowdHuman, to better evaluate detectors in crowd scenarios. The CrowdHuman dataset is large, rich-annotated and contains high diversity. There are a total of $470K$ human instances from the train and validation subsets, and $~22.6$ persons per image, with various kinds of occlusions in the dataset. Each human instance is annotated with a head bounding-box, human visible-region bounding-box and human full-body bounding-box. Baseline performance of state-of-the-art detection frameworks on CrowdHuman is presented. The cross-dataset generalization results of CrowdHuman dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on previous dataset including Caltech-USA, CityPersons, and Brainwash without bells and whistles. We hope our dataset will serve as a solid baseline and help promote future research in human detection tasks. 
### 4.Semantic Binary Segmentation using Convolutional Networks without  Decoders [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00138.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose an efficient architecture for semantic image segmentation using the depth-to-space (D2S) operation. Our D2S model is comprised of a standard CNN encoder followed by a depth-to-space reordering of the final convolutional feature maps. Our approach eliminates the decoder portion of traditional encoder-decoder segmentation models and reduces the amount of computation almost by half. As a participant of the DeepGlobe Road Extraction competition, we evaluate our models on the corresponding road segmentation dataset. Our highly efficient D2S models exhibit comparable performance to standard segmentation models with much lower computational cost. 
### 5.Dialog-based Interactive Image Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00145.pdf)
> Existing methods for interactive image retrieval have demonstrated the merit of integrating user feedback, improving retrieval results. However, most current systems rely on restricted forms of user feedback, such as binary relevance responses, or feedback based on a fixed set of relative attributes, which limits their impact. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to interactive image search that enables users to provide feedback via natural language, allowing for more natural and effective interaction. We formulate the task of dialog-based interactive image retrieval as a reinforcement learning problem, and reward the dialog system for improving the rank of the target image during each dialog turn. To avoid the cumbersome and costly process of collecting human-machine conversations as the dialog system learns, we train our system with a user simulator, which is itself trained to describe the differences between target and candidate images. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated in a footwear retrieval application. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that 1) our proposed learning framework achieves better accuracy than other supervised and reinforcement learning baselines and 2) user feedback based on natural language rather than pre-specified attributes leads to more effective retrieval results, and a more natural and expressive communication interface. 
### 6.Fixation Data Analysis for High Resolution Satellite Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00192.pdf)
> The presented study is an eye tracking experiment for high-resolution satellite (HRS) images. The reported experiment explores the Area Of Interest (AOI) based analysis of eye fixation data for complex HRS images. The study reflects the requisite of reference data for bottom-up saliency-based segmentation and the struggle of eye tracking data analysis for complex satellite images. The intended fixation data analysis aims towards the reference data creation for bottom-up saliency-based segmentation of high-resolution satellite images. The analytical outcome of this experimental study provides a solution for AOI-based analysis for fixation data in the complex environment of satellite images and recommendations for reference data construction which is already an ongoing effort. 
### 7.Locate, Segment and Match: A Pipeline for Object Matching and  Registration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00223.pdf)
> Image registration requires simultaneous processing of multiple images to match the keypoints or landmarks of the contained objects. These images often come from different modalities for example CT and Ultrasound (US), and pose the challenge of establishing one to one correspondence. In this work, a novel pipeline of convolutional neural networks is developed to perform the desired registration. The complete objective is divided into three parts: localization of the object of interest, segmentation and matching transformation. Most of the existing approaches skip the localization step and are prone to fail in general scenarios. We overcome this challenge through detection which also establishes initial correspondence between the images. A modified version of single shot multibox detector is used for this purpose. The detected region is cropped and subsequently segmented to generate a mask corresponding to the desired object. The mask is used by a spatial transformer network employing thin plate spline deformation to perform the desired registration. Initial experiments on MNIST and Caltech-101 datasets show that the proposed model is able to accurately match the segmented images. The proposed framework is extended to the registration of CT and US images, which is free from any data specific assumptions and has better generalization capability as compared to the existing rule based/classical approaches. 
### 8.Learning to Sketch with Shortcut Cycle Consistency [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00247.pdf)
> To see is to sketch -- free-hand sketching naturally builds ties between human and machine vision. In this paper, we present a novel approach for translating an object photo to a sketch, mimicking the human sketching process. This is an extremely challenging task because the photo and sketch domains differ significantly. Furthermore, human sketches exhibit various levels of sophistication and abstraction even when depicting the same object instance in a reference photo. This means that even if photo-sketch pairs are available, they only provide weak supervision signal to learn a translation model. Compared with existing supervised approaches that solve the problem of D(E(photo)) -&gt; sketch, where E($\cdot$) and D($\cdot$) denote encoder and decoder respectively, we take advantage of the inverse problem (e.g., D(E(sketch)) -&gt; photo), and combine with the unsupervised learning tasks of within-domain reconstruction, all within a multi-task learning framework. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches based on cycle consistency (i.e., D(E(D(E(photo)))) -&gt; photo), we introduce a shortcut consistency enforced at the encoder bottleneck (e.g., D(E(photo)) -&gt; photo) to exploit the additional self-supervision. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed model is superior to a number of state-of-the-art alternatives. We also show that the synthetic sketches can be used to train a better fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) model, effectively alleviating the problem of sketch data scarcity. 
### 9.Conditional Image-to-Image Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00251.pdf)
> Image-to-image translation tasks have been widely investigated with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and dual learning. However, existing models lack the ability to control the translated results in the target domain and their results usually lack of diversity in the sense that a fixed image usually leads to (almost) deterministic translation result. In this paper, we study a new problem, conditional image-to-image translation, which is to translate an image from the source domain to the target domain conditioned on a given image in the target domain. It requires that the generated image should inherit some domain-specific features of the conditional image from the target domain. Therefore, changing the conditional image in the target domain will lead to diverse translation results for a fixed input image from the source domain, and therefore the conditional input image helps to control the translation results. We tackle this problem with unpaired data based on GANs and dual learning. We twist two conditional translation models (one translation from A domain to B domain, and the other one from B domain to A domain) together for inputs combination and reconstruction while preserving domain independent features. We carry out experiments on men's faces from-to women's faces translation and edges to shoes&amp;bags translations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. 
### 10.Object Activity Scene Description, Construction and Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00258.pdf)
> Action recognition is a critical task for social robots to meaningfully engage with their environment. 3D human skeleton-based action recognition is an attractive research area in recent years. Although, the existing approaches are good at action recognition, it is a great challenge to recognize a group of actions in an activity scene. To tackle this problem, at first, we partition the scene into several primitive actions (PAs) based upon motion attention mechanism. Then, the primitive actions are described by the trajectory vectors of corresponding joints. After that, motivated by text classification based on word embedding, we employ convolution neural network (CNN) to recognize activity scenes by considering motion of joints as "word" of activity. The experimental results on the scenes of human activity dataset show the efficiency of the proposed approach. 
### 11.Fast and Efficient Depth Map Estimation from Light Fields [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00264.pdf)
> The paper presents an algorithm for depth map estimation from the light field images in relatively small amount of time, using only single thread on CPU. The proposed method improves existing principle of line fitting in 4-dimensional light field space. Line fitting is based on color values comparison using kernel density estimation. Our method utilizes result of Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with Census transform-based matching cost as a border initialization for line fitting. It provides a significant reduction of computations needed to find the best depth match. With the suggested evaluation metric we show that proposed method is applicable for efficient depth map estimation while preserving low computational time compared to others. 
### 12.An Universal Image Attractiveness Ranking Framework [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00309.pdf)
> We propose a benchmark framework to rank image attractiveness using a novel model trained with a large set of side-by-side multi-labeled image pairs. We use an efficient way to collect a large and diverse set of image pairs and directly rate each pair' relative attractiveness. The judges only need to provide relative ranking between two images without the need to directly assign an absolute score. We investigate a deep attractiveness rank net (DARN), a combination of deep convolutional neural network and rank net, to generate an attractiveness score mean and variance for each image after training on side-by-side rated image pairs. The deep neural network jointly learns a mapping from each DNN feature to a score mean and variance, and the underlying criteria the judges use to label each image pair. The score can be used as a useful feature to rank image attractiveness. We show reasonable prediction error of the model and observe significant image quality improvement when using this feature in a real commercial search engine. 
### 13.On the Limitation of MagNet Defense against $L_1$-based Adversarial  Examples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00310.pdf)
> In recent years, defending adversarial perturbations to natural examples in order to build robust machine learning models trained by deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an emerging research field in the conjunction of deep learning and security. In particular, MagNet consisting of an adversary detector and a data reformer is by far one of the strongest defenses in the black-box oblivious attack setting, where the attacker aims to craft transferable adversarial examples from an undefended DNN model to bypass an unknown defense module deployed on the same DNN model. Under this setting, MagNet can successfully defend a variety of attacks in DNNs, including the high-confidence adversarial examples generated by the Carlini and Wagner's attack based on the $L_2$ distortion metric. However, in this paper, under the same attack setting we show that adversarial examples crafted based on the $L_1$ distortion metric can easily bypass MagNet and mislead the target DNN image classifiers on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We also provide explanations on why the considered approach can yield adversarial examples with superior attack performance and conduct extensive experiments on variants of MagNet to verify its lack of robustness to $L_1$ distortion based attacks. Notably, our results substantially weaken the assumption of effective threat models on MagNet that require knowing the deployed defense technique when attacking DNNs (i.e., the gray-box attack setting). 
### 14.Head Mounted Pupil Tracking Using Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00311.pdf)
> Pupil tracking is an important branch of object tracking which require high precision. We investigate head mounted pupil tracking which is often more convenient and precise than remote pupil tracking, but also more challenging. When pupil tracking suffers from noise like bad illumination, detection precision dramatically decreases. Due to the appearance of head mounted recording device and public benchmark image datasets, head mounted tracking algorithms have become easier to design and evaluate. In this paper, we propose a robust head mounted pupil detection algorithm which uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to combine different features of pupil. Here we consider three features of pupil. Firstly, we use three pupil feature-based algorithms to find pupil center independently. Secondly, we use a CNN to evaluate the quality of each result. Finally, we select the best result as output. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than the present state-of-art. 
### 15.Predicting resonant properties of plasmonic structures by deep learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00312.pdf)
> Deep learning can be used to extract meaningful results from images. In this paper, we used convolutional neural networks combined with recurrent neural networks on images of plasmonic structures and extract absorption data form them. To provide the required data for the model we did 100,000 simulations with similar setups and random structures. By designing a deep network we could find a model that could predict the absorption of any structure with similar setup. We used convolutional neural networks to get the spatial information from the images and we used recurrent neural networks to help the model find the relationship between the spatial information obtained from convolutional neural network model. With this design we could reach a very low loss in predicting the absorption compared to the results obtained from numerical simulation in a very short time. 
### 16.Neural Compatibility Modeling with Attentive Knowledge Distillation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00313.pdf)
> Recently, the booming fashion sector and its huge potential benefits have attracted tremendous attention from many research communities. In particular, increasing research efforts have been dedicated to the complementary clothing matching as matching clothes to make a suitable outfit has become a daily headache for many people, especially those who do not have the sense of aesthetics. Thanks to the remarkable success of neural networks in various applications such as image classification and speech recognition, the researchers are enabled to adopt the data-driven learning methods to analyze fashion items. Nevertheless, existing studies overlook the rich valuable knowledge (rules) accumulated in fashion domain, especially the rules regarding clothing matching. Towards this end, in this work, we shed light on complementary clothing matching by integrating the advanced deep neural networks and the rich fashion domain knowledge. Considering that the rules can be fuzzy and different rules may have different confidence levels to different samples, we present a neural compatibility modeling scheme with attentive knowledge distillation based on the teacher-student network scheme. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset show the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines. Based upon the comparisons, we observe certain fashion insights that add value to the fashion matching study. As a byproduct, we released the codes, and involved parameters to benefit other researchers. 
### 17.Object Counts! Bringing Explicit Detections Back into Image Captioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00314.pdf)
> The use of explicit object detectors as an intermediate step to image captioning - which used to constitute an essential stage in early work - is often bypassed in the currently dominant end-to-end approaches, where the language model is conditioned directly on a mid-level image embedding. We argue that explicit detections provide rich semantic information, and can thus be used as an interpretable representation to better understand why end-to-end image captioning systems work well. We provide an in-depth analysis of end-to-end image captioning by exploring a variety of cues that can be derived from such object detections. Our study reveals that end-to-end image captioning systems rely on matching image representations to generate captions, and that encoding the frequency, size and position of objects are complementary and all play a role in forming a good image representation. It also reveals that different object categories contribute in different ways towards image captioning. 
### 18.Occluded object reconstruction for first responders with augmented  reality glasses using conditional generative adversarial networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00322.pdf)
> Firefighters suffer a variety of life-threatening risks, including line-of-duty deaths, injuries, and exposures to hazardous substances. Support for reducing these risks is important. We built a partially occluded object reconstruction method on augmented reality glasses for first responders. We used a deep learning based on conditional generative adversarial networks to train associations between the various images of flammable and hazardous objects and their partially occluded counterparts. Our system then reconstructed an image of a new flammable object. Finally, the reconstructed image was superimposed on the input image to provide "transparency". The system imitates human learning about the laws of physics through experience by learning the shape of flammable objects and the flame characteristics. 
### 19.A Deep Face Identification Network Enhanced by Facial Attributes  Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00324.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a new deep framework which predicts facial attributes and leverage it as a soft modality to improve face identification performance. Our model is an end to end framework which consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) whose output is fanned out into two separate branches; the first branch predicts facial attributes while the second branch identifies face images. Contrary to the existing multi-task methods which only use a shared CNN feature space to train these two tasks jointly, we fuse the predicted attributes with the features from the face modality in order to improve the face identification performance. Experimental results show that our model brings benefits to both face identification as well as facial attribute prediction performance, especially in the case of identity facial attributes such as gender prediction. We tested our model on two standard datasets annotated by identities and face attributes. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms most of the current existing face identification and attribute prediction methods. 
### 20.Study of Residual Networks for Image Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00325.pdf)
> Deep neural networks demonstrate to have a high performance on image classification tasks while being more difficult to train. Due to the complexity and vanishing gradient problem, it normally takes a lot of time and more computational power to train deeper neural networks. Deep residual networks (ResNets) can make the training process faster and attain more accuracy compared to their equivalent neural networks. ResNets achieve this improvement by adding a simple skip connection parallel to the layers of convolutional neural networks. In this project we first design a ResNet model that can perform the image classification task on the Tiny ImageNet dataset with a high accuracy, then we compare the performance of this ResNet model with its equivalent Convolutional Network (ConvNet). Our findings illustrate that ResNets are more prone to overfitting despite their higher accuracy. Several methods to prevent overfitting such as adding dropout layers and stochastic augmentation of the training dataset has been studied in this work. 
### 21.I Know How You Feel: Emotion Recognition with Facial Landmarks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00326.pdf)
> Classification of human emotions remains an important and challenging task for many computer vision algorithms, especially in the era of humanoid robots which coexist with humans in their everyday life. Currently proposed methods for emotion recognition solve this task using multi-layered convolutional networks that do not explicitly infer any facial features in the classification phase. In this work, we postulate a fundamentally different approach to solve emotion recognition task that relies on incorporating facial landmarks as a part of the classification loss function. To that end, we extend a recently proposed Deep Alignment Network (DAN), that achieves state-of-the-art results in the recent facial landmark recognition challenge, with a term related to facial features. Thanks to this simple modification, our model called EmotionalDAN is able to outperform state-of-the-art emotion classification methods on two challenging benchmark dataset by up to 5%. 
### 22.3D-PhysNet: Learning the Intuitive Physics of Non-Rigid Object  Deformations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00328.pdf)
> The ability to interact and understand the environment is a fundamental prerequisite for a wide range of applications from robotics to augmented reality. In particular, predicting how deformable objects will react to applied forces in real time is a significant challenge. This is further confounded by the fact that shape information about encountered objects in the real world is often impaired by occlusions, noise and missing regions e.g. a robot manipulating an object will only be able to observe a partial view of the entire solid. In this work we present a framework, 3D-PhysNet, which is able to predict how a three-dimensional solid will deform under an applied force using intuitive physics modelling. In particular, we propose a new method to encode the physical properties of the material and the applied force, enabling generalisation over materials. The key is to combine deep variational autoencoders with adversarial training, conditioned on the applied force and the material properties. We further propose a cascaded architecture that takes a single 2.5D depth view of the object and predicts its deformation. Training data is provided by a physics simulator. The network is fast enough to be used in real-time applications from partial views. Experimental results show the viability and the generalisation properties of the proposed architecture. 
### 23.DeepDIVA: A Highly-Functional Python Framework for Reproducible  Experiments [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00329.pdf)
> We introduce DeepDIVA: an infrastructure designed to enable quick and intuitive setup of reproducible experiments with a large range of useful analysis functionality. Reproducing scientific results can be a frustrating experience, not only in document image analysis but in machine learning in general. Using DeepDIVA a researcher can either reproduce a given experiment with a very limited amount of information or share their own experiments with others. Moreover, the framework offers a large range of functions, such as boilerplate code, keeping track of experiments, hyper-parameter optimization, and visualization of data and results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, this paper presents case studies in the area of handwritten document analysis where researchers benefit from the integrated functionality. DeepDIVA is implemented in Python and uses the deep learning framework PyTorch. It is completely open source, and accessible as Web Service through DIVAServices. 
### 24.Real-Time Human Detection as an Edge Service Enabled by a Lightweight  CNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00330.pdf)
> Edge computing allows more computing tasks to take place on the decentralized nodes at the edge of networks. Today many delay sensitive, mission-critical applications can leverage these edge devices to reduce the time delay or even to enable real time, online decision making thanks to their onsite presence. Human objects detection, behavior recognition and prediction in smart surveillance fall into that category, where a transition of a huge volume of video streaming data can take valuable time and place heavy pressure on communication networks. It is widely recognized that video processing and object detection are computing intensive and too expensive to be handled by resource limited edge devices. Inspired by the depthwise separable convolution and Single Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSD), a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (LCNN) is introduced in this paper. By narrowing down the classifier's searching space to focus on human objects in surveillance video frames, the proposed LCNN algorithm is able to detect pedestrians with an affordable computation workload to an edge device. A prototype has been implemented on an edge node (Raspberry PI 3) using openCV libraries, and satisfactory performance is achieved using real world surveillance video streams. The experimental study has validated the design of LCNN and shown it is a promising approach to computing intensive applications at the edge. 
### 25.Intelligent Surveillance as an Edge Network Service: from Harr-Cascade,  SVM to a Lightweight CNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00331.pdf)
> Edge computing efficiently extends the realm of information technology beyond the boundary defined by cloud computing paradigm. Performing computation near the source and destination, edge computing is promising to address the challenges in many delay sensitive applications, like real time surveillance. Leveraging the ubiquitously connected cameras and smart mobile devices, it enables video analytics at the edge. However, traditional human objects detection and tracking approaches are still computationally too expensive to edge devices. Aiming at intelligent surveillance as an edge network service, this work explored the feasibility of two popular human objects detection schemes, Harr Cascade and SVM, at the edge. Understanding the existing constraints of the algorithms, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (LCNN) is proposed using the depthwise separable convolution. The proposed LCNN considerably reduces the number of parameters without affecting the quality of the output, thus it is ideal for an edge device usage. Being trained with Single Shot Multi box Detector (SSD) to pinpoint each human object location, it gives coordination of bounding box around the object. We implemented and tested LCNN on an edge device using Raspberry PI 3. The intensive experimental comparison study has validated that the proposed LCNN is a feasible design for real time human object detection as an edge service. 
### 26.Deep learning approach to Fourier ptychographic microscopy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00334.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained tremendous success in solving complex inverse problems. The aim of this work is to develop a novel CNN framework to reconstruct video sequence of dynamic live cells captured using a computational microscopy technique, Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM). The unique feature of the FPM is its capability to reconstruct images with both wide field-of-view (FOV) and high resolution, i.e. a large space-bandwidth-product (SBP), by taking a series of low resolution intensity images. For live cell imaging, a single FPM frame contains thousands of cell samples with different morphological features. Our idea is to fully exploit the statistical information provided by this large spatial ensemble so as to make predictions in a sequential measurement, without using any additional temporal dataset. Specifically, we show that it is possible to reconstruct high-SBP dynamic cell videos by a CNN trained only on the first FPM dataset captured at the beginning of a time-series experiment. Our CNN approach reconstructs a 12800X10800 pixels phase image using only ~25 seconds, a 50X speedup compared to the model-based FPM algorithm. In addition, the CNN further reduces the required number of images in each time frame by ~6X. Overall, this significantly improves the imaging throughput by reducing both the acquisition and computational times. The proposed CNN is based on the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework. Additionally, we also exploit transfer learning so that our pre-trained CNN can be further optimized to image other cell types. Our technique demonstrates a promising deep learning approach to continuously monitor large live-cell populations over an extended time and gather useful spatial and temporal information with sub-cellular resolution.

> This short paper describes our solution to the 2018 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence One-Minute Gradual-Emotional Behavior Challenge, whose goal was to estimate continuous arousal and valence values from short videos. We designed four base regression models using visual and audio features, and then used a spectral approach to fuse them to obtain improved performance. 
### 28.Domain and Geometry Agnostic CNNs for Left Atrium Segmentation in 3D  Ultrasound [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00357.pdf)
> Segmentation of the left atrium and deriving its size can help to predict and detect various cardiovascular conditions. Automation of this process in 3D Ultrasound image data is desirable, since manual delineations are time-consuming, challenging and observer-dependent. Convolutional neural networks have made improvements in computer vision and in medical image analysis. They have successfully been applied to segmentation tasks and were extended to work on volumetric data. In this paper we introduce a combined deep-learning based approach on volumetric segmentation in Ultrasound acquisitions with incorporation of prior knowledge about left atrial shape and imaging device. The results show, that including a shape prior helps the domain adaptation and the accuracy of segmentation is further increased with adversarial learning. 
### 29.Ultra Power-Efficient CNN Domain Specific Accelerator with 9.3TOPS/Watt  for Mobile and Embedded Applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00361.pdf)
> Computer vision performances have been significantly improved in recent years by Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). Currently, applications using CNN algorithms are deployed mainly on general purpose hardwares, such as CPUs, GPUs or FPGAs. However, power consumption, speed, accuracy, memory footprint, and die size should all be taken into consideration for mobile and embedded applications. Domain Specific Architecture (DSA) for CNN is the efficient and practical solution for CNN deployment and implementation. We designed and produced a 28nm Two-Dimensional CNN-DSA accelerator with an ultra power-efficient performance of 9.3TOPS/Watt and with all processing done in the internal memory instead of outside DRAM. It classifies 224x224 RGB image inputs at more than 140fps with peak power consumption at less than 300mW and an accuracy comparable to the VGG benchmark. The CNN-DSA accelerator is reconfigurable to support CNN model coefficients of various layer sizes and layer types, including convolution, depth-wise convolution, short-cut connections, max pooling, and ReLU. Furthermore, in order to better support real-world deployment for various application scenarios, especially with low-end mobile and embedded platforms and MCUs (Microcontroller Units), we also designed algorithms to fully utilize the CNN-DSA accelerator efficiently by reducing the dependency on external accelerator computation resources, including implementation of Fully-Connected (FC) layers within the accelerator and compression of extracted features from the CNN-DSA accelerator. Live demos with our CNN-DSA accelerator on mobile and embedded systems show its capabilities to be widely and practically applied in the real world. 
### 30.Which Facial Expressions Can Reveal Your Gender? A Study With 3D Faces [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00371.pdf)
> Human exhibit rich gender cues in both appearance and behavior. In computer vision domain, gender recognition from facial appearance have been extensively studied, while facial behavior based gender recognition studies remain rare. In this work, we first demonstrate that facial expressions influence the gender patterns presented in 3D face, and gender recognition performance increases when training and testing within the same expression. In further, we design experiments which directly extract the morphological changes resulted from facial expressions as features, for expression-based gender recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that gender can be recognized with considerable accuracy in Happy and Disgust expressions, while Surprise and Sad expressions do not convey much gender related information. This is the first work in the literature which investigates expression-based gender classification with 3D faces, and reveals the strength of gender patterns incorporated in different types of expressions, namely the Happy, the Disgust, the Surprise and the Sad expressions. 
### 31.Boosting Self-Supervised Learning via Knowledge Transfer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00385.pdf)
> In self-supervised learning, one trains a model to solve a so-called pretext task on a dataset without the need for human annotation. The main objective, however, is to transfer this model to a target domain and task. Currently, the most effective transfer strategy is fine-tuning, which restricts one to use the same model or parts thereof for both pretext and target tasks. In this paper, we present a novel framework for self-supervised learning that overcomes limitations in designing and comparing different tasks, models, and data domains. In particular, our framework decouples the structure of the self-supervised model from the final task-specific fine-tuned model. This allows us to: 1) quantitatively assess previously incompatible models including handcrafted features; 2) show that deeper neural network models can learn better representations from the same pretext task; 3) transfer knowledge learned with a deep model to a shallower one and thus boost its learning. We use this framework to design a novel self-supervised task, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the common benchmarks in PASCAL VOC 2007, ILSVRC12 and Places by a significant margin. Our learned features shrink the mAP gap between models trained via self-supervised learning and supervised learning from 5.9% to 2.6% in object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007. 
### 32.Robust Face Recognition with Deeply Normalized Depth Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00406.pdf)
> Depth information has been proven useful for face recognition. However, existing depth-image-based face recognition methods still suffer from noisy depth values and varying poses and expressions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for normalizing facial depth images to frontal pose and neutral expression and extracting robust features from the normalized depth images. The method is implemented via two deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), normalization network ($Net_{N}$) and feature extraction network ($Net_{F}$). Given a facial depth image, $Net_{N}$ first converts it to an HHA image, from which the 3D face is reconstructed via a DCNN. $Net_{N}$ then generates a pose-and-expression normalized (PEN) depth image from the reconstructed 3D face. The PEN depth image is finally passed to $Net_{F}$, which extracts a robust feature representation via another DCNN for face recognition. Our preliminary evaluation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in recognizing faces of arbitrary poses and expressions with depth images. 
### 33.Image Denoising via Collaborative Dual-Domain Patch Filtering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00472.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel image denoising algorithm exploiting features from both spatial as well as transformed domain. We implement intensity-invariance based improved grouping for collaborative support-agnostic sparse reconstruction. For collaboration firstly, we stack similar-structured patches via intensity-invariant correlation measure. The grouped patches collaborate to yield desirable sparse estimates for noise filtering. This is because similar patches share the same support in the transformed domain, such similar supports can be used as probabilities of active taps to refine the sparse estimates. This ultimately produces a very useful patch estimate thus increasing the quality of recovered image by discarding the noise-causing components. A region growing based spatially developed post-processor is then applied to further enhance the smooth regions by extracting the spatial domain features. We also extend our proposed method for denoising of color images. Comparison results with the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PNSR) and structural similarity (SSIM) index from extensive experimentations via a broad range of scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm. 
### 34.Adapting Mask-RCNN for Automatic Nucleus Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00500.pdf)
> Automatic segmentation of microscopy images is an important task in medical image processing and analysis. Nucleus detection is an important example of this task. Mask-RCNN is a recently proposed state-of-the-art algorithm for object detection, object localization, and object instance segmentation of natural images. In this paper we demonstrate that Mask-RCNN can be used to perform highly effective and efficient automatic segmentations of a wide range of microscopy images of cell nuclei, for a variety of cells acquired under a variety of conditions. 
### 35.Machine Learning for Exam Triage [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00503.pdf)
> In this project, we extend the state-of-the-art CheXNet (Rajpurkar et al. [2017]) by making use of the additional non-image features in the dataset. Our model produced better AUROC scores than the original CheXNet. 
### 36.Adaptive View Planning for Aerial 3D Reconstruction of Complex Scenes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00506.pdf)
> With the proliferation of small aerial vehicles, acquiring close up aerial imagery for high quality reconstruction of complex scenes is gaining importance. We present an adaptive view planning method to collect such images in an automated fashion. We start by sampling a small set of views to build a coarse proxy to the scene. We then present (i)~a method that builds a view manifold for view selection, and (ii) an algorithm to select a sparse set of views. The vehicle then visits these viewpoints to cover the scene, and the procedure is repeated until reconstruction quality converges or a desired level of quality is achieved. The view manifold provides an effective efficiency/quality compromise between using the entire 6 degree of freedom pose space and using a single view hemisphere to select the views. <br />Our results show that, in contrast to existing "explore and exploit" methods which collect only two sets of views, reconstruction quality can be drastically improved by adding a third set. They also indicate that three rounds of data collection is sufficient even for very complex scenes. We compare our algorithm to existing methods in three challenging scenes. We require each algorithm to select the same number of views. Our algorithm generates views which produce the least reconstruction error. 
### 37.Weakly Supervised Attention Learning for Textual Phrases Grounding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00545.pdf)
> Grounding textual phrases in visual content is a meaningful yet challenging problem with various potential applications such as image-text inference or text-driven multimedia interaction. Most of the current existing methods adopt the supervised learning mechanism which requires ground-truth at pixel level during training. However, fine-grained level ground-truth annotation is quite time-consuming and severely narrows the scope for more general applications. In this extended abstract, we explore methods to localize flexibly image regions from the top-down signal (in a form of one-hot label or natural languages) with a weakly supervised attention learning mechanism. In our model, two types of modules are utilized: a backbone module for visual feature capturing, and an attentive module generating maps based on regularized bilinear pooling. We construct the model in an end-to-end fashion which is trained by encouraging the spatial attentive map to shift and focus on the region that consists of the best matched visual features with the top-down signal. We demonstrate the preliminary yet promising results on a testbed that is synthesized with multi-label MNIST data. 
### 38.Generating Synthetic X-ray Images of a Person from the Surface Geometry [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00553.pdf)
> We present a novel framework that learns to predict human anatomy from body surface. Specifically, our approach generates a synthetic X-ray image of a person only from the person's surface geometry. Furthermore, the synthetic X-ray image is parametrized and can be manipulated by adjusting a set of body markers which are also generated during the X-ray image prediction. With the proposed framework, multiple synthetic X-ray images can easily be generated by varying surface geometry. By perturbing the parameters, several additional synthetic X-ray images can be generated from the same surface geometry. As a result, our approach offers a potential to overcome the training data barrier in the medical domain. This capability is achieved by learning a pair of networks - one learns to generate the full image from the partial image and a set of parameters, and the other learns to estimate the parameters given the full image. During training, the two networks are trained iteratively such that they would converge to a solution where the predicted parameters and the full image are consistent with each other. In addition to medical data enrichment, our framework can also be used for image completion as well as anomaly detection. 
### 39.Secure Face Matching Using Fully Homomorphic Encryption [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00577.pdf)
> Face recognition technology has demonstrated tremendous progress over the past few years, primarily due to advances in representation learning. As we witness the widespread adoption of these systems, it is imperative to consider the security of face representations. In this paper, we explore the practicality of using a fully homomorphic encryption based framework to secure a database of face templates. This framework is designed to preserve the privacy of users and prevent information leakage from the templates, while maintaining their utility through template matching directly in the encrypted domain. Additionally, we also explore a batching and dimensionality reduction scheme to trade-off face matching accuracy and computational complexity. Experiments on benchmark face datasets (LFW, IJB-A, IJB-B, CASIA) indicate that secure face matching can be practically feasible (16 KB template size and 0.01 sec per match pair for 512-dimensional features from SphereFace) while exhibiting minimal loss in matching performance. 
### 40.Structure-sensitive Multi-scale Deep Neural Network for Low-Dose CT  Denoising [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00587.pdf)
> Computed tomography (CT) is a popular medical imaging modality in clinical applications. At the same time, the x-ray radiation dose associated with CT scans raises public concerns due to its potential risks to the patients. Over the past years, major efforts have been dedicated to the development of Low-Dose CT (LDCT) methods. However, the radiation dose reduction compromises the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to strong noise and artifacts that down-grade CT image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D noise reduction method, called Structure-sensitive Multi-scale Generative Adversarial Net (SMGAN), to improve the LDCT image quality. Specifically, we incorporate three-dimensional (3D) volumetric information to improve the image quality. Also, different loss functions for training denoising models are investigated. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively preserve structural and texture information from normal-dose CT (NDCT) images, and significantly suppress noise and artifacts. Qualitative visual assessments by three experienced radiologists demonstrate that the proposed method retrieves more detailed information, and outperforms competing methods. 
### 41.Structured Analysis Dictionary Learning for Image Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00597.pdf)
> We propose a computationally efficient and high-performance classification algorithm by incorporating class structural information in analysis dictionary learning. To achieve more consistent classification, we associate a class characteristic structure of independent subspaces and impose it on the classification error constrained analysis dictionary learning. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms in a variety of visual classification tasks. In addition, our method greatly reduces the training and testing computational complexity. 
### 42.Bi-directional Graph Structure Information Model for Multi-Person Pose  Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00603.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage network architecture with two branches in each stage to estimate multi-person poses in images. The first branch predicts the confidence maps of joints and uses a geometrical transform kernel to propagate information between neighboring joints at the confidence level. The second branch proposes a bi-directional graph structure information model (BGSIM) to encode rich contextual information and to infer the occlusion relationship among different joints. We dynamically determine the joint point with highest response of the confidence maps as base point of passing message in BGSIM. Based on the proposed network structure, we achieve an average precision of 62.9 on the COCO Keypoint Challenge dataset and 77.6 on the MPII (multi-person) dataset. Compared with other state-of-art methods, our method can achieve highly promising results on our selected multi-person dataset without extra training. 
### 43.Towards Interpretable Face Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00611.pdf)
> Deep CNNs have been pushing the frontier of visual recognition over past years. Besides recognition accuracy, strong demands in understanding deep CNNs in the research community motivate developments of tools to dissect pre-trained models to visualize how they make predictions. Recent works further push the interpretability in the network learning stage to learn more meaningful representations. In this work, focusing on a specific area of visual recognition, we report our efforts towards interpretable face recognition. We propose a spatial activation diversity loss to learn more structured face representations. By leveraging the structure, we further design a feature activation diversity loss to push the interpretable representations to be discriminative and robust to occlusions. We demonstrate on three face recognition benchmarks that our proposed method is able to improve face recognition accuracy with easily interpretable face representations. 
### 44.Deep Perm-Set Net: Learn to predict sets with unknown permutation and  cardinality using deep neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00613.pdf)
> Many real-world problems, e.g. object detection, have outputs that are naturally expressed as sets of entities. This creates a challenge for traditional deep neural networks which naturally deal with structured outputs such as vectors, matrices or tensors. We present a novel approach for learning to predict sets with unknown permutation and cardinality using deep neural networks. Specifically, in our formulation we incorporate the permutation as unobservable variable and estimate its distribution during the learning process using alternating optimization. We demonstrate the validity of this new formulation on two relevant vision problems: object detection, for which our formulation outperforms state-of-the-art detectors such as Faster R-CNN and YOLO, and a complex CAPTCHA test, where we observe that, surprisingly, our set based network acquired the ability of mimicking arithmetics without any rules being coded. 
### 45.Interpretable Fully Convolutional Classification of Intrapapillary  Capillary Loops for Real-Time Detection of Early Squamous Neoplasia [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00632.pdf)
> In this work, we have concentrated our efforts on the interpretability of classification results coming from a fully convolutional neural network. Motivated by the classification of oesophageal tissue for real-time detection of early squamous neoplasia, the most frequent kind of oesophageal cancer in Asia, we present a new dataset and a novel deep learning method that by means of deep supervision and a newly introduced concept, the embedded Class Activation Map (eCAM), focuses on the interpretability of results as a design constraint of a convolutional network. We present a new approach to visualise attention that aims to give some insights on those areas of the oesophageal tissue that lead a network to conclude that the images belong to a particular class and compare them with those visual features employed by clinicians to produce a clinical diagnosis. In comparison to a baseline method which does not feature deep supervision but provides attention by grafting Class Activation Maps, we improve the F1-score from 87.3% to 92.7% and provide more detailed attention maps. 
### 46.A Deep Network for Arousal-Valence Emotion Prediction with  Acoustic-Visual Cues [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00638.pdf)

### 47.MX-LSTM: mixing tracklets and vislets to jointly forecast trajectories  and head poses [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00652.pdf)
> Recent approaches on trajectory forecasting use tracklets to predict the future positions of pedestrians exploiting Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. This paper shows that adding vislets, that is, short sequences of head pose estimations, allows to increase significantly the trajectory forecasting performance. We then propose to use vislets in a novel framework called MX-LSTM, capturing the interplay between tracklets and vislets thanks to a joint unconstrained optimization of full covariance matrices during the LSTM backpropagation. At the same time, MX-LSTM predicts the future head poses, increasing the standard capabilities of the long-term trajectory forecasting approaches. With standard head pose estimators and an attentional-based social pooling, MX-LSTM scores the new trajectory forecasting state-of-the-art in all the considered datasets (Zara01, Zara02, UCY, and TownCentre) with a dramatic margin when the pedestrians slow down, a case where most of the forecasting approaches struggle to provide an accurate solution. 
### 48.Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Model for Human Dynamics [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00655.pdf)
> Human motion modeling is a classic problem in computer vision and graphics. Challenges in modeling human motion include high dimensional prediction as well as extremely complicated dynamics.We present a novel approach to human motion modeling based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). The hierarchical structure of CNN makes it capable of capturing both spatial and temporal correlations effectively. In our proposed approach,a convolutional long-term encoder is used to encode the whole given motion sequence into a long-term hidden variable, which is used with a decoder to predict the remainder of the sequence. The decoder itself also has an encoder-decoder structure, in which the short-term encoder encodes a shorter sequence to a short-term hidden variable, and the spatial decoder maps the long and short-term hidden variable to motion predictions. By using such a model, we are able to capture both invariant and dynamic information of human motion, which results in more accurate predictions. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the Human3.6M and CMU Motion Capture datasets. Our code is available at the project website. 
### 49.Text to Image Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00676.pdf)
> Generating images from natural language is one of the primary applications of recent conditional generative models. Besides testing our ability to model conditional, highly dimensional distributions, text to image synthesis has many exciting and practical applications such as photo editing or computer-aided content creation. Recent progress has been made using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This material starts with a gentle introduction to these topics and discusses the existent state of the art models. Moreover, I propose Wasserstein GAN-CLS, a new model for conditional image generation based on the Wasserstein distance which offers guarantees of stability. Then, I show how the novel loss function of Wasserstein GAN-CLS can be used in a Conditional Progressive Growing GAN. In combination with the proposed loss, the model boosts by 7.07% the best Inception Score (on the Caltech birds dataset) of the models which use only the sentence-level visual semantics. The only model which performs better than the Conditional Wasserstein Progressive Growing GAN is the recently proposed AttnGAN which uses word-level visual semantics as well. 
### 50.Joint Surgical Gesture and Task Classification with Multi-Task and  Multimodal Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00721.pdf)
> We propose a novel multi-modal and multi-task architecture for simultaneous low level gesture and surgical task classification in Robot Assisted Surgery (RAS) videos.Our end-to-end architecture is based on the principles of a long short-term memory network (LSTM) that jointly learns temporal dynamics on rich representations of visual and motion features, while simultaneously classifying activities of low-level gestures and surgical tasks. Our experimental results show that our approach is superior compared to an ar- chitecture that classifies the gestures and surgical tasks separately on visual cues and motion cues respectively. We train our model on a fixed random set of 1200 gesture video segments and use the rest 422 for testing. This results in around 42,000 gesture frames sampled for training and 14,500 for testing. For a 6 split experimentation, while the conventional approach reaches an Average Precision (AP) of only 29% (29.13%), our architecture reaches an AP of 51% (50.83%) for 3 tasks and 14 possible gesture labels, resulting in an improvement of 22% (21.7%). Our architecture learns temporal dynamics on rich representations of visual and motion features that compliment each other for classification of low-level gestures and surgical tasks. Its multi-task learning nature makes use of learned joint re- lationships and combinations of shared and task-specific representations. While benchmark studies focus on recognizing gestures that take place under specific tasks, we focus on recognizing common gestures that reoccur across different tasks and settings and significantly perform better compared to conventional architectures. 
### 51.Unsupervised Features for Facial Expression Intensity Estimation over  Time [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00780.pdf)
> The diversity of facial shapes and motions among persons is one of the greatest challenges for automatic analysis of facial expressions. In this paper, we propose a feature describing expression intensity over time, while being invariant to person and the type of performed expression. Our feature is a weighted combination of the dynamics of multiple points adapted to the overall expression trajectory. We evaluate our method on several tasks all related to temporal analysis of facial expression. The proposed feature is compared to a state-of-the-art method for expression intensity estimation, which it outperforms. We use our proposed feature to temporally align multiple sequences of recorded 3D facial expressions. Furthermore, we show how our feature can be used to reveal person-specific differences in performances of facial expressions. Additionally, we apply our feature to identify the local changes in face video sequences based on action unit labels. For all the experiments our feature proves to be robust against noise and outliers, making it applicable to a variety of applications for analysis of facial movements. 
### 52.Learnable PINs: Cross-Modal Embeddings for Person Identity [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00833.pdf)
> We propose and investigate an identity sensitive joint embedding of face and voice. Such an embedding enables cross-modal retrieval from voice to face and from face to voice. We make the following four contributions: first, we show that the embedding can be learnt from videos of talking faces, without requiring any identity labels, using a form of cross-modal self-supervision; second, we develop a curriculum learning schedule for hard negative mining targeted to this task, that is essential for learning to proceed successfully; third, we demonstrate and evaluate cross-modal retrieval for identities unseen and unheard during training over a number of scenarios and establish a benchmark for this novel task; finally, we show an application of using the joint embedding for automatically retrieving and labelling characters in TV dramas. 
### 53.Altered Fingerprints: Detection and Localization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00911.pdf)
> Fingerprint alteration, also referred to as obfuscation presentation attack, is to intentionally tamper or damage the real friction ridge patterns to avoid identification by an AFIS. This paper proposes a method for detection and localization of fingerprint alterations. Our main contributions are: (i) design and train CNN models on fingerprint images and minutiae-centered local patches in the image to detect and localize regions of fingerprint alterations, and (ii) train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize altered fingerprints whose characteristics are similar to true altered fingerprints. A successfully trained GAN can alleviate the limited availability of altered fingerprint images for research. A database of 4,815 altered fingerprints from 270 subjects, and an equal number of rolled fingerprint images are used to train and test our models. The proposed approach achieves a True Detection Rate (TDR) of 99.24% at a False Detection Rate (FDR) of 2%, outperforming published results. The altered fingerprint detection and localization model and code, and the synthetically generated altered fingerprint dataset will be open-sourced. 
### 54.Multi-Resolution Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion For Remote Sensing Data With  Label Uncertainty [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00930.pdf)
> In remote sensing, each sensor can provide complementary or reinforcing information. It is valuable to fuse outputs from multiple sensors to boost overall performance. Previous supervised fusion methods often require accurate labels for each pixel in the training data. However, in many remote sensing applications, pixel-level labels are difficult or infeasible to obtain. In addition, outputs from multiple sensors may have different levels of resolution or modalities (such as rasterized hyperspectral imagery versus LiDAR 3D point clouds). This paper presents a Multiple Instance Multi-Resolution Fusion (MIMRF) framework that can fuse multi-resolution and multi-modal sensor outputs while learning from ambiguously and imprecisely labeled training data. Experiments were conducted on the MUUFL Gulfport hyperspectral and LiDAR data set and a remotely-sensed soybean and weed data set. Results show improved, consistent performance on scene understanding and agricultural applications when compared to traditional fusion methods. 
### 55.Exploring the Limits of Weakly Supervised Pretraining [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00932.pdf)
> State-of-the-art visual perception models for a wide range of tasks rely on supervised pretraining. ImageNet classification is the de facto pretraining task for these models. Yet, ImageNet is now nearly ten years old and is by modern standards "small". Even so, relatively little is known about the behavior of pretraining with datasets that are multiple orders of magnitude larger. The reasons are obvious: such datasets are difficult to collect and annotate. In this paper, we present a unique study of transfer learning with large convolutional networks trained to predict hashtags on billions of social media images. Our experiments demonstrate that training for large-scale hashtag prediction leads to excellent results. We show improvements on several image classification and object detection tasks, and report the highest ImageNet-1k single-crop, top-1 accuracy to date: 85.4% (97.6% top-5). We also perform extensive experiments that provide novel empirical data on the relationship between large-scale pretraining and transfer learning performance. 
### 56.SaaS: Speed as a Supervisor for Semi-supervised Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00980.pdf)
> We introduce the SaaS Algorithm for semi-supervised learning, which uses learning speed during stochastic gradient descent in a deep neural network to measure the quality of an iterative estimate of the posterior probability of unknown labels. Training speed in supervised learning correlates strongly with the percentage of correct labels, so we use it as an inference criterion for the unknown labels, without attempting to infer the model parameters at first. Despite its simplicity, SaaS achieves state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised learning benchmarks. 
### 57.Fine-Grained Facial Expression Analysis Using Dimensional Emotion Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01024.pdf)
> Automated facial expression analysis has a variety of applications in human-computer interaction. Traditional methods mainly analyze prototypical facial expressions of no more than eight discrete emotions as a classification task. However, in practice, spontaneous facial expressions in naturalistic environment can represent not only a wide range of emotions, but also different intensities within an emotion family. In such situation, these methods are not reliable or adequate. In this paper, we propose to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze facial expressions explainable in a dimensional emotion model. The proposed method accommodates not only a set of basic emotion expressions, but also a full range of other emotions and subtle emotion intensities that we both feel in ourselves and perceive in others in our daily life. Specifically, we first mapped facial expressions into dimensional measures so that we transformed facial expression analysis from a classification problem to a regression one. We then tested our CNN-based methods for facial expression regression and these methods demonstrated promising performance. Moreover, we improved our method by a bilinear pooling which encodes second-order statistics of features. We showed such bilinear-CNN models significantly outperformed their respective baselines. 
### 58.Computing CNN Loss and Gradients for Pose Estimation with Riemannian  Geometry [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01026.pdf)
> Pose estimation, i.e. predicting a 3D rigid transformation with respect to a fixed co-ordinate frame in, SE(3), is an omnipresent problem in medical image analysis with applications such as: image rigid registration, anatomical standard plane detection, tracking and device/camera pose estimation. Deep learning methods often parameterise a pose with a representation that separates rotation and translation. As commonly available frameworks do not provide means to calculate loss on a manifold, regression is usually performed using the L2-norm independently on the rotation's and the translation's parameterisations, which is a metric for linear spaces that does not take into account the Lie group structure of SE(3). In this paper, we propose a general Riemannian formulation of the pose estimation problem. We propose to train the CNN directly on SE(3) equipped with a left-invariant Riemannian metric, coupling the prediction of the translation and rotation defining the pose. At each training step, the ground truth and predicted pose are elements of the manifold, where the loss is calculated as the Riemannian geodesic distance. We then compute the optimisation direction by back-propagating the gradient with respect to the predicted pose on the tangent space of the manifold SE(3) and update the network weights. We thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of our loss function by comparing its performance with popular and most commonly used existing methods, on tasks such as image-based localisation and intensity-based 2D/3D registration. We also show that hyper-parameters, used in our loss function to weight the contribution between rotations and translations, can be intrinsically calculated from the dataset to achieve greater performance margins. 
### 59.Unsupervised Learning using Pretrained CNN and Associative Memory Bank [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01033.pdf)
> Deep Convolutional features extracted from a comprehensive labeled dataset, contain substantial representations which could be effectively used in a new domain. Despite the fact that generic features achieved good results in many visual tasks, fine-tuning is required for pretrained deep CNN models to be more effective and provide state-of-the-art performance. Fine tuning using the backpropagation algorithm in a supervised setting, is a time and resource consuming process. In this paper, we present a new architecture and an approach for unsupervised object recognition that addresses the above mentioned problem with fine tuning associated with pretrained CNN-based supervised deep learning approaches while allowing automated feature extraction. Unlike existing works, our approach is applicable to general object recognition tasks. It uses a pretrained (on a related domain) CNN model for automated feature extraction pipelined with a Hopfield network based associative memory bank for storing patterns for classification purposes. The use of associative memory bank in our framework allows eliminating backpropagation while providing competitive performance on an unseen dataset. 
### 60.EML-NET:An Expandable Multi-Layer NETwork for Saliency Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01047.pdf)
> In this work, we apply state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) architectures for saliency prediction. Our results show that better saliency features can be delivered by a deeper CNN model. However, it is very space-consuming to apply a complex model due to the large size of input images. The space complexity becomes even more problematic when we extract features from multiple convolutional layers or different models. <br />In this paper, we propose a modular saliency system which aims at splitting the whole network into small modules. The main difference in our approach s that the encoder and decoder can be separately trained for the scalability. Furthermore, the encoder can contain more than one CNN model to extract features and the models can have different architectures or pre-trained on different datasets. This parallel design allows us to better utilize the computational space in order to apply more powerful encoder. More importantly, our network can be easily expanded almost without extra spaces, other pre-trained CNN models can be combined for a wider range of visual knowledge. We denote our expandable multi-layer network as EML-NET in this paper. Our method is evaluated on three public saliency benchmarks, SALICON, MIT300 and CAT2000. The proposed EML-NET achieves state-of-the-art results on the metric of Normalized Scanpath Saliency using a modified loss function. 
### 61.Vision-based Structural Inspection using Multiscale Deep Convolutional  Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01055.pdf)
> Current methods of practice for inspection of civil infrastructure typically involve visual assessments conducted manually by trained inspectors. For post-earthquake structural inspections, the number of structures to be inspected often far exceeds the capability of the available inspectors. The labor intensive and time consuming natures of manual inspection have engendered research into development of algorithms for automated damage identification using computer vision techniques. In this paper, a novel damage localization and classification technique based on a state of the art computer vision algorithm is presented to address several key limitations of current computer vision techniques. The proposed algorithm carries out a pixel-wise classification of each image at multiple scales using a deep convolutional neural network and can recognize 6 different types of damage. The resulting output is a segmented image where the portion of the image representing damage is outlined and classified as one of the trained damage categories. The proposed method is evaluated in terms of pixel accuracy and the application of the method to real world images is shown. 
### 62.Perceptually Optimized Generative Adversarial Network for Single Image  Dehazing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01084.pdf)
> Existing approaches towards single image dehazing including both model-based and learning-based heavily rely on the estimation of so-called transmission maps. Despite its conceptual simplicity, using transmission maps as an intermediate step often makes it more difficult to optimize the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. To overcome this weakness, we propose a direct deep learning approach toward image dehazing bypassing the step of transmission map estimation and facilitating end-to-end perceptual optimization. Our technical contributions are mainly three-fold. First, based on the analogy between dehazing and denoising, we propose to directly learn a nonlinear mapping from the space of degraded images to that of haze-free ones via recursive deep residual learning; Second, inspired by the success of generative adversarial networks (GAN), we propose to optimize the perceptual quality of dehazed images by introducing a discriminator and a loss function adaptive to hazy conditions; Third, we propose to remove notorious halo-like artifacts at large scene depth discontinuities by a novel application of guided filtering. Extensive experimental results have shown that the subjective qualities of dehazed images by the proposed perceptually optimized GAN (POGAN) are often more favorable than those by existing state-of-the-art approaches especially when hazy condition varies. 
### 63.Detection of Unknown Anomalies in Streaming Videos with Generative  Energy-based Boltzmann Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01090.pdf)
> Abnormal event detection is one of the important objectives in research and practical applications of video surveillance. However, there are still three challenging problems for most anomaly detection systems in practical setting: limited labeled data, ambiguous definition of "abnormal" and expensive feature engineering steps. This paper introduces a unified detection framework to handle these challenges using energy-based models, which are powerful tools for unsupervised representation learning. Our proposed models are firstly trained on unlabeled raw pixels of image frames from an input video rather than hand-crafted visual features; and then identify the locations of abnormal objects based on the errors between the input video and its reconstruction produced by the models. To handle video stream, we develop an online version of our framework, wherein the model parameters are updated incrementally with the image frames arriving on the fly. Our experiments show that our detectors, using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs) as core modules, achieve superior anomaly detection performance to unsupervised baselines and obtain accuracy comparable with the state-of-the-art approaches when evaluating at the pixel-level. More importantly, we discover that our system trained with DBMs is able to simultaneously perform scene clustering and scene reconstruction. This capacity not only distinguishes our method from other existing detectors but also offers a unique tool to investigate and understand how the model works. 
### 64.USAR: an Interactive User-specific Aesthetic Ranking Framework for  Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01091.pdf)
> When assessing whether an image is of high or low quality, it is indispensable to take personal preference into account. Existing aesthetic models lay emphasis on hand-crafted features or deep features commonly shared by high quality images, but with limited or no consideration for personal preference and user interaction. To that end, we propose a novel and user-friendly aesthetic ranking framework via powerful deep neural network and a small amount of user interaction, which can automatically estimate and rank the aesthetic characteristics of images in accordance with users' preference. Our framework takes as input a series of photos that users prefer, and produces as output a reliable, user-specific aesthetic ranking model matching with users' preference. Considering the subjectivity of personal preference and the uncertainty of user's single selection, a unique and exclusive dataset will be constructed interactively to describe the preference of one individual by retrieving the most similar images with regard to those specified by users. Based on this unique user-specific dataset and sufficient well-designed aesthetic attributes, a customized aesthetic distribution model can be learned, which concatenates both personalized preference and aesthetic rules. We conduct extensive experiments and user studies on two large-scale public datasets, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms those work based on conventional aesthetic assessment or ranking model. 
### 65.The feasibility of automated identification of six algae types using  neural networks and fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01093.pdf)
> Harmful algae blooms (HABs), which produce lethal toxins, are a growing global concern since they negatively affect the quality of drinking water and have major negative impact on wildlife, the fishing industry, as well as tourism and recreational water use. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of leveraging machine learning and fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features to enable the identification of six different algae types in an automated fashion. More specifically, a custom multi-band fluorescence imaging microscope is used to capture fluorescence imaging data of a water sample at six different excitation wavelengths ranging from 405 nm - 530 nm. A number of morphological and spectral fluorescence features are then extracted from the isolated micro-organism imaging data, and used to train neural network classification models designed for the purpose of identification of the six algae types given an isolated micro-organism. Experimental results using three different neural network classification models showed that the use of either fluorescence-based spectral features or fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features to train neural network classification models led to statistically significant improvements in identification accuracy when compared to the use of morphological features (with average identification accuracies of 95.7%+/-3.5% and 96.1%+/-1.5%, respectively). These preliminary results are quite promising, given that the identification accuracy of human taxonomists are typically between the range of 67% and 83%, and thus illustrates the feasibility of leveraging machine learning and fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features as a viable method for automated identification of different algae types. 
### 66.MC-GAN: Multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Image  Synthesis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01123.pdf)
> In this paper, we introduce a new method for generating an object image from text attributes on a desired location, when the base image is given. One step further to the existing studies on text-to-image generation mainly focusing on the object's appearance, the proposed method aims to generate an object image preserving the given background information, which is the first attempt in this field. To tackle the problem, we propose a multi-conditional GAN (MC-GAN) which controls both the object and background information jointly. As a core component of MC-GAN, we propose a synthesis block which disentangles the object and background information in the training stage. This block enables MC-GAN to generate a realistic object image with the desired background by controlling the amount of the background information from the given base image using the foreground information from the text attributes. From the experiments with Caltech-200 bird and Oxford-102 flower datasets, we show that our model is able to generate photo-realistic images with a resolution of 128 x 128. The source code of MC-GAN is released. 
### 67.Visual Object Tracking: The Initialisation Problem [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01146.pdf)
> Model initialisation is an important component of object tracking. Tracking algorithms are generally provided with the first frame of a sequence and a bounding box (BB) indicating the location of the object. This BB may contain a large number of background pixels in addition to the object and can lead to parts-based tracking algorithms initialising their object models in background regions of the BB. In this paper, we tackle this as a missing labels problem, marking pixels sufficiently away from the BB as belonging to the background and learning the labels of the unknown pixels. Three techniques, One-Class SVM (OC-SVM), Sampled-Based Background Model (SBBM) (a novel background model based on pixel samples), and Learning Based Digital Matting (LBDM), are adapted to the problem. These are evaluated with leave-one-video-out cross-validation on the VOT2016 tracking benchmark. Our evaluation shows both OC-SVMs and SBBM are capable of providing a good level of segmentation accuracy but are too parameter-dependent to be used in real-world scenarios. We show that LBDM achieves significantly increased performance with parameters selected by cross validation and we show that it is robust to parameter variation. 
### 68.Superpixel-guided Two-view Deterministic Geometric Model Fitting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01158.pdf)
> Geometric model fitting is a fundamental research topic in computer vision and it aims to fit and segment multiple-structure data. In this paper, we propose a novel superpixel-guided two-view geometric model fitting method (called SDF), which can obtain reliable and consistent results for real images. Specifically, SDF includes three main parts: a deterministic sampling algorithm, a model hypothesis updating strategy and a novel model selection algorithm. The proposed deterministic sampling algorithm generates a set of initial model hypotheses according to the prior information of superpixels. Then the proposed updating strategy further improves the quality of model hypotheses. After that, by analyzing the properties of the updated model hypotheses, the proposed model selection algorithm extends the conventional "fit-and-remove" framework to estimate model instances in multiple-structure data. The three parts are tightly coupled to boost the performance of SDF in both speed and accuracy, and SDF has the deterministic nature. Experimental results show that the proposed SDF has significant advantages over several state-of-the-art fitting methods when it is applied to real images with single-structure and multiple-structure data. 
### 69.IncepText: A New Inception-Text Module with Deformable PSROI Pooling for  Multi-Oriented Scene Text Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01167.pdf)
> Incidental scene text detection, especially for multi-oriented text regions, is one of the most challenging tasks in many computer vision applications. Different from the common object detection task, scene text often suffers from a large variance of aspect ratio, scale, and orientation. To solve this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end scene text detector IncepText from an instance-aware segmentation perspective. We design a novel Inception-Text module and introduce deformable PSROI pooling to deal with multi-oriented text detection. Extensive experiments on ICDAR2015, RCTW-17, and MSRA-TD500 datasets demonstrate our method's superiority in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Our proposed method achieves 1st place result on ICDAR2015 challenge and the state-of-the-art performance on other datasets. Moreover, we have released our implementation as an OCR product which is available for public access. 
### 70.BirdNet: a 3D Object Detection Framework from LiDAR information [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01195.pdf)
> Understanding driving situations regardless the conditions of the traffic scene is a cornerstone on the path towards autonomous vehicles; however, despite common sensor setups already include complementary devices such as LiDAR or radar, most of the research on perception systems has traditionally focused on computer vision. We present a LiDAR-based 3D object detection pipeline entailing three stages. First, laser information is projected into a novel cell encoding for bird's eye view projection. Later, both object location on the plane and its heading are estimated through a convolutional neural network originally designed for image processing. Finally, 3D oriented detections are computed in a post-processing phase. Experiments on KITTI dataset show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results among comparable methods. Further tests with different LiDAR sensors in real scenarios assess the multi-device capabilities of the approach. 
### 71.Multi-Context Label Embedding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01199.pdf)
> Label embedding plays an important role in zero-shot learning. Side information such as attributes, semantic text representations, and label hierarchy are commonly used as the label embedding in zero-shot classification tasks. However, the label embedding used in former works considers either only one single context of the label, or multiple contexts without dependency. Therefore, different contexts of the label may not be well aligned in the embedding space to preserve the relatedness between labels, which will result in poor interpretability of the label embedding. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Context Label Embedding (MCLE) approach to incorporate multiple label contexts, e.g., label hierarchy and attributes, within a unified matrix factorization framework. To be specific, we model each single context by a matrix factorization formula and introduce a shared variable to capture the dependency among different contexts. Furthermore, we enforce sparsity constraint on our multi-context framework to strengthen the interpretability of the learned label embedding. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our MCLE in label description and zero-shot image classification. 
### 72.Semantic segmentation of mFISH images using convolutional networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01220.pdf)
> Multicolor in situ hybridization (mFISH) is a karyotyping technique used to detect major chromosomal alterations using fluorescent probes and imaging techniques. Manual interpretation of mFISH images is a time consuming step that can be automated using machine learning; in previous works, pixel or patch wise classification was employed, overlooking spatial information which can help identify chromosomes. In this work, we propose a fully convolutional semantic segmentation network for the interpretation of mFISH images, which uses both spatial and spectral information to classify each pixel in an end-to-end fashion. The semantic segmentation network developed was tested on samples extracted from a public dataset using cross validation. Despite having no labeling information of the image it was tested on our algorithm yielded an average correct classification ratio (CCR) of 87.41%. Previously, this level of accuracy was only achieved with state of the art algorithms when classifying pixels from the same image in which the classifier has been trained. These results provide evidence that fully convolutional semantic segmentation networks may be employed in the computer aided diagnosis of genetic diseases with improved performance over the current methods of image analysis.

> This paper describes audEERING's submissions as well as additional evaluations for the One-Minute-Gradual (OMG) emotion recognition challenge. We provide the results for audio and video processing on subject (in)dependent evaluations. On the provided Development set, we achieved 0.343 Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) for arousal (from audio) and .401 for valence (from video). 
### 74.Multi-label Learning Based Deep Transfer Neural Network for Facial  Attribute Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01282.pdf)
> Deep Neural Network (DNN) has recently achieved outstanding performance in a variety of computer vision tasks, including facial attribute classification. The great success of classifying facial attributes with DNN often relies on a massive amount of labelled data. However, in real-world applications, labelled data are only provided for some commonly used attributes (such as age, gender); whereas, unlabelled data are available for other attributes (such as attraction, hairline). To address the above problem, we propose a novel deep transfer neural network method based on multi-label learning for facial attribute classification, termed FMTNet, which consists of three sub-networks: the Face detection Network (FNet), the Multi-label learning Network (MNet) and the Transfer learning Network (TNet). Firstly, based on the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), FNet is fine-tuned for face detection. Then, MNet is fine-tuned by FNet to predict multiple attributes with labelled data, where an effective loss weight scheme is developed to explicitly exploit the correlation between facial attributes based on attribute grouping. Finally, based on MNet, TNet is trained by taking advantage of unsupervised domain adaptation for unlabelled facial attribute classification. The three sub-networks are tightly coupled to perform effective facial attribute classification. A distinguishing characteristic of the proposed FMTNet method is that the three sub-networks (FNet, MNet and TNet) are constructed in a similar network structure. Extensive experimental results on challenging face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art methods. 
### 75.Multi-task Learning of Cascaded CNN for Facial Attribute Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01290.pdf)
> Recently, facial attribute classification (FAC) has attracted significant attention in the computer vision community. Great progress has been made along with the availability of challenging FAC datasets. However, conventional FAC methods usually firstly pre-process the input images (i.e., perform face detection and alignment) and then predict facial attributes. These methods ignore the inherent dependencies among these tasks (i.e., face detection, facial landmark localization and FAC). Moreover, some methods using convolutional neural network are trained based on the fixed loss weights without considering the differences between facial attributes. In order to address the above problems, we propose a novel multi-task learning of cas- caded convolutional neural network method, termed MCFA, for predicting multiple facial attributes simultaneously. Specifically, the proposed method takes advantage of three cascaded sub-networks (i.e., S_Net, M_Net and L_Net corresponding to the neural networks under different scales) to jointly train multiple tasks in a coarse-to-fine manner, which can achieve end-to-end optimization. Furthermore, the proposed method automatically assigns the loss weight to each facial attribute based on a novel dynamic weighting scheme, thus making the proposed method concentrate on predicting the more difficult facial attributes. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art FAC methods on the challenging CelebA and LFWA datasets. 
### 76.Evaluation of CNN-based Single-Image Depth Estimation Methods [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01328.pdf)
> While an increasing interest in deep models for single-image depth estimation methods can be observed, established schemes for their evaluation are still limited. We propose a set of novel quality criteria, allowing for a more detailed analysis by focusing on specific characteristics of depth maps. In particular, we address the preservation of edges and planar regions, depth consistency, and absolute distance accuracy. In order to employ these metrics to evaluate and compare state-of-the-art single-image depth estimation approaches, we provide a new high-quality RGB-D dataset. We used a DSLR camera together with a laser scanner to acquire high-resolution images and highly accurate depth maps. Experimental results show the validity of our proposed evaluation protocol. 
### 77.SIPS: Unsupervised Succinct Interest Points [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01358.pdf)
> Detecting interest points is a key component of vision-based estimation algorithms, such as visual odometry or visual SLAM. Classically, interest point detection has been done with methods such as Harris, FAST, or DoG. Recently, better detectors have been proposed based on Neural Networks. Traditionally, interest point detectors have been designed to maximize repeatability or matching score. Instead, we pursue another metric, which we call succinctness. This metric captures the minimum amount of interest points that need to be extracted in order to achieve accurate relative pose estimation. Extracting a minimum amount of interest points is attractive for many applications, because it reduces computational load, memory, and, potentially, data transmission. We propose a novel reinforcement- and ranking-based training framework, which uses a full relative pose estimation pipeline during training. It can be trained in an unsupervised manner, without pose or 3D point ground truth. Using this training framework, we present a detector which outperforms previous interest point detectors in terms of succinctness on a variety of publicly available datasets. 
### 78.Machine learning regression on hyperspectral data to estimate multiple  water parameters [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01361.pdf)
> In this paper, we present a regression framework involving several machine learning models to estimate water parameters based on hyperspectral data. Measurements from a multi-sensor field campaign, conducted on the River Elbe, Germany, represent the benchmark dataset. It contains hyperspectral data and the five water parameters chlorophyll a, green algae, diatoms, CDOM and turbidity. We apply a PCA for the high-dimensional data as a possible preprocessing step. Then, we evaluate the performance of the regression framework with and without this preprocessing step. The regression results of the framework clearly reveal the potential of estimating water parameters based on hyperspectral data with machine learning. The proposed framework provides the basis for further investigations, such as adapting the framework to estimate water parameters of different inland waters. 
### 79.Boosting Domain Adaptation by Discovering Latent Domains [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01386.pdf)
> Current Domain Adaptation (DA) methods based on deep architectures assume that the source samples arise from a single distribution. However, in practice, most datasets can be regarded as mixtures of multiple domains. In these cases exploiting single-source DA methods for learning target classifiers may lead to sub-optimal, if not poor, results. In addition, in many applications it is difficult to manually provide the domain labels for all source data points, i.e. latent domains should be automatically discovered. This paper introduces a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which (i) automatically discovers latent domains in visual datasets and (ii) exploits this information to learn robust target classifiers. Our approach is based on the introduction of two main components, which can be embedded into any existing CNN architecture: (i) a side branch that automatically computes the assignment of a source sample to a latent domain and (ii) novel layers that exploit domain membership information to appropriately align the distribution of the CNN internal feature representations to a reference distribution. We test our approach on publicly-available datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art multi-source DA methods by a large margin. 
### 80.InceptB: A CNN Based Classification Approach for Recognizing Traditional  Bengali Games [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01442.pdf)
> Sports activities are an integral part of our day to day life. Introducing autonomous decision making and predictive models to recognize and analyze different sports events and activities has become an emerging trend in computer vision arena. Albeit the advances and vivid applications of artificial intelligence and computer vision in recognizing different popular western games, there remains a very minimal amount of efforts in the application of computer vision in recognizing traditional Bangladeshi games. We, in this paper, have described a novel Deep Learning based approach for recognizing traditional Bengali games. We have retrained the final layer of the renowned Inception V3 architecture developed by Google for our classification approach. Our approach shows promising results with an average accuracy of 80% approximately in correctly recognizing among 5 traditional Bangladeshi sports events. 
### 81.A Multi-component CNN-RNN Approach for Dimensional Emotion Recognition  in-the-wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01452.pdf)
> This paper presents our approach to the One-Minute Gradual-Emotion Recognition (OMG-Emotion) Challenge, focusing on dimensional emotion recognition through visual analysis of the provided emotion videos. The approach is based on a Convolutional and Recurrent (CNN-RNN) deep neural architecture we have developed for the relevant large AffWild Emotion Database. We extended and adapted this architecture, by letting a combination of multiple features generated in the CNN component be explored by RNN subnets. Our target has been to obtain best performance on the OMG-Emotion visual validation data set, while learning the respective visual training data set. Extended experimentation has led to best architectures for the estimation of the values of the valence and arousal emotion dimensions over these data sets. 
### 82.Pixel-wise Attentional Gating for Parsimonious Pixel Labeling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01556.pdf)
> To achieve parsimonious inference in per-pixel labeling tasks with a limited computational budget, we propose a \emph{Pixel-wise Attentional Gating} unit (\emph{PAG}) that learns to selectively process a subset of spatial locations at each layer of a deep convolutional network. PAG is a generic, architecture-independent, problem-agnostic mechanism that can be readily "plugged in" to an existing model with fine-tuning. We utilize PAG in two ways: 1) learning spatially varying pooling fields that improve model performance without the extra computation cost associated with multi-scale pooling, and 2) learning a dynamic computation policy for each pixel to decrease total computation while maintaining accuracy. <br />We extensively evaluate PAG on a variety of per-pixel labeling tasks, including semantic segmentation, boundary detection, monocular depth and surface normal estimation. We demonstrate that PAG allows competitive or state-of-the-art performance on these tasks. Our experiments show that PAG learns dynamic spatial allocation of computation over the input image which provides better performance trade-offs compared to related approaches (e.g., truncating deep models or dynamically skipping whole layers). Generally, we observe PAG can reduce computation by $10\%$ without noticeable loss in accuracy and performance degrades gracefully when imposing stronger computational constraints. 
### 83.Transferring GANs: generating images from limited data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01677.pdf)
> Transferring the knowledge of pretrained networks to new domains by means of finetuning is a widely used practice for applications based on discriminative models. To the best of our knowledge this practice has not been studied within the context of generative deep networks. Therefore, we study domain adaptation applied to image generation with generative adversarial networks. We evaluate several aspects of domain adaptation, including the impact of target domain size, the relative distance between source and target domain, and the initialization of conditional GANs. Our results show that using knowledge from pretrained networks can shorten the convergence time and can significantly improve the quality of the generated images, especially when the target data is limited. We show that these conclusions can also be drawn for conditional GANs even when the pretrained model was trained without conditioning. Our results also suggest that density may be more important than diversity and a dataset with one or few densely sampled classes may be a better source model than more diverse datasets such as ImageNet or Places. 
### 84.Feature extraction with regularized siamese networks for outlier  detection: application to lesion screening in medical imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01717.pdf)
> Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are designed to assist clinicians in various tasks, including highlighting abnormal regions in a medical image. A common approach consists in training a voxel-level binary classifier on a set of feature vectors extracted from normal and pathological areas in patients' scans. However, many pathologies (such as epilepsy) are characterized by lesions that may be located anywhere in the brain, have various shapes, sizes and texture. An adequate representation of such a heterogeneity requires a significant amount of annotated data which is a major issue in the medical domain. Therefore, we built on a previously proposed approach that considers epilepsy lesion detection task as a voxel-level outlier detection problem. It consists in building a oc-SVM classifier for each voxel in the brain volume using a small number of clinically-guided features El Azami et al., 2016. Our goal in this study is to make a step forward by replacing the handcrafted features with automatically learnt representations using neural networks. We propose a novel version of siamese networks trained on patches extracted from healthy patients' scans only. This network, composed of stacked autoencoders as subnetworks, is regularized by the reconstruction error of the patches. It is designed to learn representations that bring patches centered at the same voxel localization 'closer' with respect to the chosen metric (i.e. cosine). Finally, the middle layer representations of the subnetworks are fed to oc-SVM classifiers at voxel-level. The method is validated on 3 patients' MRI scans with confirmed epilepsy lesions and shows a promising performance. 
### 85.Facial Landmark Point Localization using Coarse-to-Fine Deep Recurrent  Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01760.pdf)
> Facial landmark point localization is a typical problem in computer vision and is extensively used for increasing accuracy of face recognition, facial expression analysis, face animation etc. In recent years, substantial effort have been deployed by many researcher to design a robust facial landmark detection system. However, it still remains as one of the most challenging tasks due to the existence of extreme poses, exaggerated facial expression, unconstrained illumination, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine deep recurrent-neural-network (RNN) based framework, which uses heat-map images for facial landmark point localization. The use of heat-map images allows us using the entire face image instead of the face initialization bounding boxes or patch images around the landmark points. Performance of our proposed framework shows significant improvement in case of handling difficult face images with higher degree of occlusion, variation of pose, large yaw angles and illumination. In comparison with the best current state-of-the-art technique a reduction of 45% in failure rate and an improvement of 11.5% in area under the curve for 300-W private test set are some of the main contributions of our proposed framework. 
### 86.Unsupervised learning for concept detection in medical images: a  comparative analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01803.pdf)
> As digital medical imaging becomes more prevalent and archives increase in size, representation learning exposes an interesting opportunity for enhanced medical decision support systems. On the other hand, medical imaging data is often scarce and short on annotations. In this paper, we present an assessment of unsupervised feature learning approaches for images in the biomedical literature, which can be applied to automatic biomedical concept detection. Six unsupervised representation learning methods were built, including traditional bags of visual words, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Each model was trained, and their respective feature space evaluated using images from the ImageCLEF 2017 concept detection task. We conclude that it is possible to obtain more powerful representations with modern deep learning approaches, in contrast with previously popular computer vision methods. Although generative adversarial networks can provide good results, they are harder to succeed in highly varied data sets. The possibility of semi-supervised learning, as well as their use in medical information retrieval problems, are the next steps to be strongly considered. 
### 87.Failure Prediction for Autonomous Driving [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01811.pdf)
> The primary focus of autonomous driving research is to improve driving accuracy. While great progress has been made, state-of-the-art algorithms still fail at times. Such failures may have catastrophic consequences. It therefore is important that automated cars foresee problems ahead as early as possible. This is also of paramount importance if the driver will be asked to take over. We conjecture that failures do not occur randomly. For instance, driving models may fail more likely at places with heavy traffic, at complex intersections, and/or under adverse weather/illumination conditions. This work presents a method to learn to predict the occurrence of these failures, i.e. to assess how difficult a scene is to a given driving model and to possibly give the human driver an early headsup. A camera-based driving model is developed and trained over real driving datasets. The discrepancies between the model's predictions and the human `ground-truth' maneuvers were then recorded, to yield the `failure' scores. Experimental results show that the failure score can indeed be learned and predicted. Thus, our prediction method is able to improve the overall safety of an automated driving model by alerting the human driver timely, leading to better human-vehicle collaborative driving. 
### 88.Object and Text-guided Semantics for CNN-based Activity Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01818.pdf)
> Many previous methods have demonstrated the importance of considering semantically relevant objects for carrying out video-based human activity recognition, yet none of the methods have harvested the power of large text corpora to relate the objects and the activities to be transferred into learning a unified deep convolutional neural network. We present a novel activity recognition CNN which co-learns the object recognition task in an end-to-end multitask learning scheme to improve upon the baseline activity recognition performance. We further improve upon the multitask learning approach by exploiting a text-guided semantic space to select the most relevant objects with respect to the target activities. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate this approach. 
### 89.Automatic Estimation of Modulation Transfer Functions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01872.pdf)
> The modulation transfer function (MTF) is widely used to characterise the performance of optical systems. Measuring it is costly and it is thus rarely available for a given lens specimen. Instead, MTFs based on simulations or, at best, MTFs measured on other specimens of the same lens are used. Fortunately, images recorded through an optical system contain ample information about its MTF, only that it is confounded with the statistics of the images. This work presents a method to estimate the MTF of camera lens systems directly from photographs, without the need for expensive equipment. We use a custom grid display to accurately measure the point response of lenses to acquire ground truth training data. We then use the same lenses to record natural images and employ a data-driven supervised learning approach using a convolutional neural network to estimate the MTF on small image patches, aggregating the information into MTF charts over the entire field of view. It generalises to unseen lenses and can be applied for single photographs, with the performance improving if multiple photographs are available. 
### 90.Collaborations on YouTube: From Unsupervised Detection to the Impact on  Video and Channel Popularity [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01887.pdf)
> YouTube is one of the most popular platforms for streaming of user-generated video. Nowadays, professional YouTubers are organized in so called multi-channel networks (MCNs). These networks offer services such as brand deals, equipment, and strategic advice in exchange for a share of the YouTubers' revenue. A major strategy to gain more subscribers and, hence, revenue is collaborating with other YouTubers. Yet, collaborations on YouTube have not been studied in a detailed quantitative manner. This paper aims to close this gap with the following contributions. First, we collect a YouTube dataset covering video statistics over three months for 7,942 channels. Second, we design a framework for collaboration detection given a previously unknown number of persons featuring in YouTube videos. We denote this framework for the analysis of collaborations in YouTube videos using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based approach as CATANA. Third, we analyze about 2.4 years of video content and use CATANA to answer research questions providing guidance for YouTubers and MCNs for efficient collaboration strategies. Thereby, we focus on (i) collaboration frequency and partner selectivity, (ii) the influence of MCNs on channel collaborations, (iii) collaborating channel types, and (iv) the impact of collaborations on video and channel popularity. Our results show that collaborations are in many cases significantly beneficial in terms of viewers and newly attracted subscribers for both collaborating channels, showing often more than 100% popularity growth compared with non-collaboration videos. 
### 91.Predicting Gender and Race from Near Infrared Iris and Periocular Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01912.pdf)
> Recent research has explored the possibility of automatically deducing information such as gender, age and race of an individual from their biometric data. While the face modality has been extensively studied in this regard, relatively less research has been conducted in the context of the iris modality. In this paper, we first review the medical literature to establish a biological basis for extracting gender and race cues from the iris. Then, we demonstrate that it is possible to use simple texture descriptors, like BSIF (Binarized Statistical Image Feature) and LBP (Local Binary Patterns), to extract gender and race attributes from a NIR ocular image used in a typical iris recognition system. The proposed method predicts race and gender from a single eye image with an accuracy of 86% and 90%, respectively. In addition, the following analysis are conducted: (a) the role of different parts of the ocular region on attribute prediction; (b) the influence of gender on race prediction, and vice-versa; (c) the impact of eye color on gender and race prediction; (d) the impact of image blur on gender and race prediction; (e) the generalizability of the method across different datasets, i.e., cross-dataset performance; and (f) the consistency of prediction performance across the left and right eyes. 
### 92.Learning to See in the Dark [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01934.pdf)
> Imaging in low light is challenging due to low photon count and low SNR. Short-exposure images suffer from noise, while long exposure can induce blur and is often impractical. A variety of denoising, deblurring, and enhancement techniques have been proposed, but their effectiveness is limited in extreme conditions, such as video-rate imaging at night. To support the development of learning-based pipelines for low-light image processing, we introduce a dataset of raw short-exposure low-light images, with corresponding long-exposure reference images. Using the presented dataset, we develop a pipeline for processing low-light images, based on end-to-end training of a fully-convolutional network. The network operates directly on raw sensor data and replaces much of the traditional image processing pipeline, which tends to perform poorly on such data. We report promising results on the new dataset, analyze factors that affect performance, and highlight opportunities for future work.

### 93.Reliability Map Estimation For CNN-Based Camera Model Attribution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01946.pdf)
> Among the image forensic issues investigated in the last few years, great attention has been devoted to blind camera model attribution. This refers to the problem of detecting which camera model has been used to acquire an image by only exploiting pixel information. Solving this problem has great impact on image integrity assessment as well as on authenticity verification. Recent advancements that use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the media forensic field have enabled camera model attribution methods to work well even on small image patches. These improvements are also important for determining forgery localization. Some patches of an image may not contain enough information related to the camera model (e.g., saturated patches). In this paper, we propose a CNN-based solution to estimate the camera model attribution reliability of a given image patch. We show that we can estimate a reliability-map indicating which portions of the image contain reliable camera traces. Testing using a well known dataset confirms that by using this information, it is possible to increase small patch camera model attribution accuracy by more than 8% on a single patch. 
### 94.Advanced local motion patterns for macro and micro facial expression  recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01951.pdf)
> In this paper, we develop a new method that recognizes facial expressions, on the basis of an innovative local motion patterns feature, with three main contributions. The first one is the analysis of the face skin temporal elasticity and face deformations during expression. The second one is a unified approach for both macro and micro expression recognition. And, the third one is the step forward towards in-the-wild expression recognition, dealing with challenges such as various intensity and various expression activation patterns, illumination variation and small head pose variations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for micro expression recognition and positions itself among top-rank state-of-the-art methods for macro expression recognition. 
### 95.MTFH: A Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing Framework for Efficient  Cross-Modal Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01963.pdf)
> Hashing has recently sparked a great revolution in cross-modal retrieval due to its low storage cost and high query speed. Most existing cross-modal hashing methods learn unified hash codes in a common Hamming space to represent all multi-modal data and make them intuitively comparable. However, such unified hash codes could inherently sacrifice their representation scalability because the data from different modalities may not have one-to-one correspondence and could be stored more efficiently by different hash codes of unequal lengths. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes a generalized and flexible cross-modal hashing framework, termed Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing (MTFH), which not only preserves the semantic similarity between the multi-modal data points, but also works seamlessly in various settings including paired or unpaired multi-modal data, and equal or varying hash length encoding scenarios. Specifically, MTFH exploits an efficient objective function to jointly learn the flexible modality-specific hash codes with different length settings, while simultaneously excavating two semantic correlation matrices to ensure heterogeneous data comparable. As a result, the derived hash codes are more semantically meaningful for various challenging cross-modal retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments evaluated on public benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of MTFH under various retrieval scenarios and show its very competitive performance with the state-of-the-arts. 
### 96.Fast-converging Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Image  Synthesis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01972.pdf)
> Building on top of the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), conditional GANs attempt to better direct the data generation process by conditioning with certain additional information. Inspired by the most recent AC-GAN, in this paper we propose a fast-converging conditional GAN (FC-GAN). In addition to the real/fake classifier used in vanilla GANs, our discriminator has an advanced auxiliary classifier which distinguishes each real class from an extra `fake' class. The `fake' class avoids mixing generated data with real data, which can potentially confuse the classification of real data as AC-GAN does, and makes the advanced auxiliary classifier behave as another real/fake classifier. As a result, FC-GAN can accelerate the process of differentiation of all classes, thus boost the convergence speed. Experimental results on image synthesis demonstrate our model is competitive in the quality of images generated while achieving a faster convergence rate. 
### 97.Unsupervised Feature Learning via Non-Parametric Instance-level  Discrimination [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01978.pdf)
> Neural net classifiers trained on data with annotated class labels can also capture apparent visual similarity among categories without being directed to do so. We study whether this observation can be extended beyond the conventional domain of supervised learning: Can we learn a good feature representation that captures apparent similarity among instances, instead of classes, by merely asking the feature to be discriminative of individual instances? We formulate this intuition as a non-parametric classification problem at the instance-level, and use noise-contrastive estimation to tackle the computational challenges imposed by the large number of instance classes. Our experimental results demonstrate that, under unsupervised learning settings, our method surpasses the state-of-the-art on ImageNet classification by a large margin. Our method is also remarkable for consistently improving test performance with more training data and better network architectures. By fine-tuning the learned feature, we further obtain competitive results for semi-supervised learning and object detection tasks. Our non-parametric model is highly compact: With 128 features per image, our method requires only 600MB storage for a million images, enabling fast nearest neighbour retrieval at the run time. 
### 98.Position Estimation of Camera Based on Unsupervised Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02020.pdf)
> It is an exciting task to recover the scene's 3d-structure and camera pose from the video sequence. Most of the current solutions divide it into two parts, monocular depth recovery and camera pose estimation. The monocular depth recovery is often studied as an independent part, and a better depth estimation is used to solve the pose. While camera pose is still estimated by traditional SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) methods in most cases. The use of unsupervised method for monocular depth recovery and pose estimation has benefited from the study of [1] and achieved good results. In this paper, we improve the method of [1]. Our emphasis is laid on the improvement of the idea and related theory, introducing a more reasonable inter frame constraints and finally synthesize the camera trajectory with inter frame pose estimation in the unified world coordinate system. And our results get better performance. 
### 99.Bone marrow cells detection: A technique for the microscopic image  analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02058.pdf)
> In the detection of myeloproliferative, the number of cells in each type of bone marrow cells (BMC) is an important parameter for the evaluation. In this study, we propose a new counting method, which also consists of three modules including localization, segmentation and classification. The localization of BMC is achieved from a color transformation enhanced BMC sample image and stepwise averaging method (SAM). In the nucleus segmentation, both SAM and Otsu's method will be applied to obtain a weighted threshold for segmenting the patch into nucleus and non-nucleus. In the cytoplasm segmentation, a color weakening transformation, an improved region growing method and the K-Means algorithm are used. The connected cells with BMC will be separated by the marker-controlled watershed algorithm. The features will be extracted for the classification after the segmentation. In this study, the BMC are classified using the SVM, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, Adaboost and Bayesian Networks into five classes including one outlier, namely, neutrophilic split granulocyte, neutrophilic stab granulocyte, metarubricyte, mature lymphocytes and the outlier (all other cells not listed). Our experimental results show that the best average recognition rate is 87.49% for the SVM. 
### 100.Learning Selfie-Friendly Abstraction from Artistic Style Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02085.pdf)
> Artistic style transfer can be thought as a process to generate different versions of abstraction of the original image. However, most of the artistic style transfer operators are not optimized for human faces thus mainly suffers from two undesirable features when applying them to selfies. First, the edges of human faces may unpleasantly deviate from the ones in the original image. Second, the skin color is far from faithful to the original one which is usually problematic in producing quality selfies. In this paper, we take a different approach and formulate this abstraction process as a gradient domain learning problem. We aim to learn a type of abstraction which not only achieves the specified artistic style but also circumvents the two aforementioned drawbacks thus highly applicable to selfie photography. We also show that our method can be directly generalized to videos with high inter-frame consistency. Our method is also robust to non-selfie images, and the generalization to various kinds of real-life scenes is discussed. We will make our code publicly available. 
### 101.RiFCN: Recurrent Network in Fully Convolutional Network for Semantic  Segmentation of High Resolution Remote Sensing Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02091.pdf)
> Semantic segmentation in high resolution remote sensing images is a fundamental and challenging task. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as fully convolutional network (FCN) and SegNet, have shown outstanding performance in many segmentation tasks. One key pillar of these successes is mining useful information from features in convolutional layers for producing high resolution segmentation maps. For example, FCN nonlinearly combines high-level features extracted from last convolutional layers; whereas SegNet utilizes a deconvolutional network which takes as input only coarse, high-level feature maps of the last convolutional layer. However, how to better fuse multi-level convolutional feature maps for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel bidirectional network called recurrent network in fully convolutional network (RiFCN), which is end-to-end trainable. It has a forward stream and a backward stream. The former is a classification CNN architecture for feature extraction, which takes an input image and produces multi-level convolutional feature maps from shallow to deep; while in the later, to achieve accurate boundary inference and semantic segmentation, boundary-aware high resolution feature maps in shallower layers and high-level but low-resolution features are recursively embedded into the learning framework (from deep to shallow) to generate a fused feature representation that draws a holistic picture of not only high-level semantic information but also low-level fine-grained details. Experimental results on two widely-used high resolution remote sensing data sets for semantic segmentation tasks, ISPRS Potsdam and Inria Aerial Image Labeling Data Set, demonstrate competitive performance obtained by the proposed methodology compared to other studied approaches. 
### 102.Revisiting Temporal Modeling for Video-based Person ReID [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02104.pdf)
> Video-based person reID is an important task, which has received much attention in recent years due to the increasing demand in surveillance and camera networks. A typical video-based person reID system consists of three parts: an image-level feature extractor (e.g. CNN), a temporal modeling method to aggregate temporal features and a loss function. Although many methods on temporal modeling have been proposed, it is hard to directly compare these methods, because the choice of feature extractor and loss function also have a large impact on the final performance. We comprehensively study and compare four different temporal modeling methods (temporal pooling, temporal attention, RNN and 3D convnets) for video-based person reID. We also propose a new attention generation network which adopts temporal convolution to extract temporal information among frames. The evaluation is done on the MARS dataset, and our methods outperform state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our source codes are released at <a href="https://github.com/jiyanggao/Video-Person-ReID.">this https URL</a> 
### 103.Estimation and Tracking of AP-diameter of the Inferior Vena Cava in  Ultrasound Images Using a Novel Active Circle Algorithm [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02125.pdf)
> Medical research suggests that the anterior-posterior (AP)-diameter of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and its associated temporal variation as imaged by bedside ultrasound is useful in guiding fluid resuscitation of the critically-ill patient. Unfortunately, indistinct edges and gaps in vessel walls are frequently present which impede accurate estimation of the IVC AP-diameter for both human operators and segmentation algorithms. The majority of research involving use of the IVC to guide fluid resuscitation involves manual measurement of the maximum and minimum AP-diameter as it varies over time. This effort proposes using a time-varying circle fitted inside the typically ellipsoid IVC as an efficient, consistent and novel approach to tracking and approximating the AP-diameter even in the context of poor image quality. In this active-circle algorithm, a novel evolution functional is proposed and shown to be a useful tool for ultrasound image processing. The proposed algorithm is compared with an expert manual measurement, and state-of-the-art relevant algorithms. It is shown that the algorithm outperforms other techniques and performs very close to manual measurement. 
### 104.A Counter-Forensic Method for CNN-Based Camera Model Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02131.pdf)
> An increasing number of digital images are being shared and accessed through websites, media, and social applications. Many of these images have been modified and are not authentic. Recent advances in the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have facilitated the task of analyzing the veracity and authenticity of largely distributed image datasets. We examine in this paper the problem of identifying the camera model or type that was used to take an image and that can be spoofed. Due to the linear nature of CNNs and the high-dimensionality of images, neural networks are vulnerable to attacks with adversarial examples. These examples are imperceptibly different from correctly classified images but are misclassified with high confidence by CNNs. In this paper, we describe a counter-forensic method capable of subtly altering images to change their estimated camera model when they are analyzed by any CNN-based camera model detector. Our method can use both the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) or the Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) to craft these adversarial images and does not require direct access to the CNN. Our results show that even advanced deep learning architectures trained to analyze images and obtain camera model information are still vulnerable to our proposed method. 
### 105.An Image dehazing approach based on the airlight field estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02142.pdf)
> This paper proposes a scheme for single image haze removal based on the airlight field (ALF) estimation. Conventional image dehazing methods which are based on a physical model generally take the global atmospheric light as a constant. However, the constant-airlight assumption may be unsuitable for images with large sky regions, which causes unacceptable brightness imbalance and color distortion in recovery images. This paper models the atmospheric light as a field function, and presents a maximum a-priori (MAP) method for jointly estimating the airlight field, the transmission rate and the haze free image. We also introduce a valid haze-level prior for effective estimate of transmission. Evaluation on real world images shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in single image dehazing, especially when the large sky region is included. 
### 106.Quantization Mimic: Towards Very Tiny CNN for Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02152.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a simple and general framework for training very tiny CNNs for object detection. Due to limited representation ability, it is challenging to train very tiny networks for complicated tasks like detection. To the best of our knowledge, our method, called Quantization Mimic, is the first one focusing on very tiny networks. We utilize two types of acceleration methods: mimic and quantization. Mimic improves the performance of a student network by transfering knowledge from a teacher network. Quantization converts a full-precision network to a quantized one without large degradation of performance. If the teacher network is quantized, the search scope of the student network will be smaller. Using this feature of the quantization, we propose Quantization Mimic. It first quantizes the large network, then mimic a quantized small network. The quantization operation can help student network to better match the feature maps from teacher network. To evaluate our approach, we carry out experiments on various popular CNNs including VGG and Resnet, as well as different detection frameworks including Faster R-CNN and R-FCN. Experiments on Pascal VOC and WIDER FACE verify that our Quantization Mimic algorithm can be applied on various settings and outperforms state-of-the-art model acceleration methods given limited computing resouces. 
### 107.Acceleration of RED via Vector Extrapolation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02158.pdf)
> Models play an important role in inverse problems, serving as the prior for representing the original signal to be recovered. REgularization by Denoising (RED) is a recently introduced general framework for constructing such priors using state-of-the-art denoising algorithms. Using RED, solving inverse problems is shown to amount to an iterated denoising process. However, as the complexity of denoising algorithms is generally high, this might lead to an overall slow algorithm. In this paper, we suggest an accelerated technique based on vector extrapolation (VE) to speed-up existing RED solvers. Numerical experiments validate the obtained gain by VE, leading to nearly 70\% savings in computations compared with the original solvers. 
### 108.Multi-Scale Face Restoration with Sequential Gating Ensemble Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02164.pdf)
> Restoring face images from distortions is important in face recognition applications and is challenged by multiple scale issues, which is still not well-solved in research area. In this paper, we present a Sequential Gating Ensemble Network (SGEN) for multi-scale face restoration issue. We first employ the principle of ensemble learning into SGEN architecture design to reinforce predictive performance of the network. The SGEN aggregates multi-level base-encoders and base-decoders into the network, which enables the network to contain multiple scales of receptive field. Instead of combining these base-en/decoders directly with non-sequential operations, the SGEN takes base-en/decoders from different levels as sequential data. Specifically, the SGEN learns to sequentially extract high level information from base-encoders in bottom-up manner and restore low level information from base-decoders in top-down manner. Besides, we propose to realize bottom-up and top-down information combination and selection with Sequential Gating Unit (SGU). The SGU sequentially takes two inputs from different levels and decides the output based on one active input. Experiment results demonstrate that our SGEN is more effective at multi-scale human face restoration with more image details and less noise than state-of-the-art image restoration models. By using adversarial training, SGEN also produces more visually preferred results than other models through subjective evaluation. 
### 109.Joint CS-MRI Reconstruction and Segmentation with a Unified Deep Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02165.pdf)
> The need for fast acquisition and automatic analysis of MRI data is growing in the age of big data. Although compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) has been studied to accelerate MRI by reducing k-space measurements, in current CS-MRI techniques MRI applications such as segmentation are overlooked when doing image reconstruction. In this paper, we test the utility of CS-MRI methods in automatic segmentation models and propose a unified deep neural network architecture called SegNetMRI which we apply to the combined CS-MRI reconstruction and segmentation problem. SegNetMRI is built upon a MRI reconstruction network with multiple cascaded blocks each containing an encoder-decoder unit and a data fidelity unit, and MRI segmentation networks having the same encoder-decoder structure. The two subnetworks are pre-trained and fine-tuned with shared reconstruction encoders. The outputs are merged into the final segmentation. Our experiments show that SegNetMRI can improve both the reconstruction and segmentation performance when using compressive measurements. 
### 110.An Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Approach to Automatic PDF Generation for  Histogram Specification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02173.pdf)
> Image enhancement plays an important role in several application in the field of computer vision and image processing. Histogram specification (HS) is one of the most widely used techniques for contrast enhancement of an image, which requires an appropriate probability density function for the transformation. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy method to find a suitable PDF automatically for histogram specification using interval type - 2 (IT2) fuzzy approach, based on the fuzzy membership values obtained from the histogram of input image. The proposed algorithm works in 5 stages which includes - symmetric Gaussian fitting on the histogram, extraction of IT2 fuzzy membership functions (MFs) and therefore, footprint of uncertainty (FOU), obtaining membership value (MV), generating PDF and application of HS. We have proposed 4 different methods to find membership values - point-wise method, center of weight method, area method, and karnik-mendel (KM) method. The framework is sensitive to local variations in the histogram and chooses the best PDF so as to improve contrast enhancement. Experimental validity of the methods used is illustrated by qualitative and quantitative analysis on several images using the image quality index - Average Information Content (AIC) or Entropy, and by comparison with the commonly used algorithms such as Histogram Equalization (HE), Recursive Mean-Separate Histogram Equalization (RMSHE) and Brightness Preserving Fuzzy Histogram Equalization (BPFHE). It has been found out that on an average, our algorithm improves the AIC index by 11.5% as compared to the index obtained by histogram equalisation. 
### 111.S4ND: Single-Shot Single-Scale Lung Nodule Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02279.pdf)
> The state of the art lung nodule detection studies rely on computationally expensive multi-stage frameworks to detect nodules from CT scans. To address this computational challenge and provide better performance, in this paper we propose S4ND, a new deep learning based method for lung nodule detection. Our approach uses a single feed forward pass of a single network for detection and provides better performance when compared to the current literature. The whole detection pipeline is designed as a single $3D$ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with dense connections, trained in an end-to-end manner. S4ND does not require any further post-processing or user guidance to refine detection results. Experimentally, we compared our network with the current state-of-the-art object detection network (SSD) in computer vision as well as the state-of-the-art published method for lung nodule detection (3D DCNN). We used publically available $888$ CT scans from LUNA challenge dataset and showed that the proposed method outperforms the current literature both in terms of efficiency and accuracy by achieving an average FROC-score of $0.897$. We also provide an in-depth analysis of our proposed network to shed light on the unclear paradigms of tiny object detection. 
### 112.DocFace: Matching ID Document Photos to Selfies [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02283.pdf)
> Numerous activities in our daily life, including transactions, access to services and transportation, require us to verify who we are by showing our ID documents containing face images, e.g. passports and driver licenses. An automatic system for matching ID document photos to live face images in real time with high accuracy would speedup the verification process and remove the burden on human operators. In this paper, by employing the transfer learning technique, we propose a new method, DocFace, to train a domain-specific network for ID document photo matching without a large dataset. Compared with the baseline of applying existing methods for general face recognition to this problem, our method achieves considerable improvement. A cross validation on an ID-Selfie dataset shows that DocFace improves the TAR from 61.14% to 92.77% at FAR=0.1%. Experimental results also indicate that given more training data, a viable system for automatic ID document photo matching can be developed and deployed. 
### 113.Skeleton-Based Action Recognition with Spatial Reasoning and Temporal  Stack Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02335.pdf)
> Skeleton-based action recognition has made great progress recently, but many problems still remain unsolved. For example, most of the previous methods model the representations of skeleton sequences without abundant spatial structure information and detailed temporal dynamics features. In this paper, we propose a novel model with spatial reasoning and temporal stack learning (SR-TSL) for skeleton based action recognition, which consists of a spatial reasoning network (SRN) and a temporal stack learning network (TSLN). The SRN can capture the high-level spatial structural information within each frame by a residual graph neural network, while the TSLN can model the detailed temporal dynamics of skeleton sequences by a composition of multiple skip-clip LSTMs. During training, we propose a clip-based incremental loss to optimize the model. We perform extensive experiments on the SYSU 3D Human-Object Interaction dataset and NTU RGB+D dataset and verify the effectiveness of each network of our model. The comparison results illustrate that our approach achieves much better results than state-of-the-art methods. 
### 114.Sharp Attention Network via Adaptive Sampling for Person  Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02336.pdf)
> In this paper, we present novel sharp attention networks by adaptively sampling feature maps from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for person re-identification (re-ID) problem. Due to the introduction of sampling-based attention models, the proposed approach can adaptively generate sharper attention-aware feature masks. This greatly differs from the gating-based attention mechanism that relies soft gating functions to select the relevant features for person re-ID. In contrast, the proposed sampling-based attention mechanism allows us to effectively trim irrelevant features by enforcing the resultant feature masks to focus on the most discriminative features. It can produce sharper attentions that are more assertive in localizing subtle features relevant to re-identifying people across cameras. For this purpose, a differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampler is employed to approximate the Bernoulli sampling to train the sharp attention networks. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of this new sharp attention model for person re-ID over the other state-of-the-art methods on three challenging benchmarks including CUHK03, Market-1501, and DukeMTMC-reID. 
### 115.A Hierarchical Matcher using Local Classifier Chains [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02339.pdf)
> This paper focuses on improving the performance of current convolutional neural networks in visual recognition without changing the network architecture. A hierarchical matcher is proposed that builds chains of local binary neural networks after one global neural network over all the class labels, named as Local Classifier Chains based Convolutional Neural Network (LCC-CNN). The signature of each sample as two components: global component based on the global network; local component based on local binary networks. The local networks are built based on label pairs created by a similarity matrix and confusion matrix. During matching, each sample travels through one global network and a chain of local networks to obtain its final matching to avoid error propagation. The proposed matcher has been evaluated with image recognition, character recognition and face recognition datasets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed matcher achieves better performance when compared with methods using only a global deep network. Compared with the UR2D system, the accuracy is improved significantly by 1% and 0.17% on the UHDB31 dataset and the IJB-A dataset, respectively. 
### 116.Full explicit consistency constraints in uncalibrated multiple  homography estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02352.pdf)
> We reveal a complete set of constraints that need to be imposed on a set of 3-by-3 matrices to ensure that the matrices represent genuine homographies associated with multiple planes between two views. We also show how to exploit the constraints to obtain more accurate estimates of homography matrices between two views. 
### 117.Elastic Registration of Medical Images With GANs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02369.pdf)
> Conventional approaches to image registration consist of time consuming iterative methods. Most current deep learning (DL) based registration methods extract deep features to use in an iterative setting. We propose an end-to-end DL method for registering multimodal images. Our approach uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) that eliminates the need for time consuming iterative methods, and directly generates the registered image with the deformation field. Appropriate constraints in the GAN cost function produce accurately registered images in less than a second. Experiments demonstrate their accuracy for multimodal retinal and cardiac MR image registration. 
### 118.A Review on Facial Micro-Expressions Analysis: Datasets, Features and  Metrics [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02397.pdf)
> Facial micro-expressions are very brief, spontaneous facial expressions that appear on the face of humans when they either deliberately or unconsciously conceal an emotion. Micro-expression has shorter duration than macro-expression, which makes it more challenging for human and machine. Over the past ten years, automatic micro-expressions recognition has attracted increasing attention from researchers in psychology, computer science, security, neuroscience and other related disciplines. The aim of this paper is to provide the insights of automatic micro-expressions and recommendations for future research. There has been a lot of datasets released over the last decade that facilitated the rapid growth in this field. However, comparison across different datasets is difficult due to the inconsistency in experiment protocol, features used and evaluation methods. To address these issues, we review the datasets, features and the performance metrics deployed in the literature. Relevant challenges such as the spatial temporal settings during data collection, emotional classes versus objective classes in data labelling, face regions in data analysis, standardisation of metrics and the requirements for real-world implementation are discussed. We conclude by proposing some promising future directions to advancing micro-expressions research. 
### 119.Unpaired Multi-Domain Image Generation via Regularized Conditional GANs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02456.pdf)
> In this paper, we study the problem of multi-domain image generation, the goal of which is to generate pairs of corresponding images from different domains. With the recent development in generative models, image generation has achieved great progress and has been applied to various computer vision tasks. However, multi-domain image generation may not achieve the desired performance due to the difficulty of learning the correspondence of different domain images, especially when the information of paired samples is not given. To tackle this problem, we propose Regularized Conditional GAN (RegCGAN) which is capable of learning to generate corresponding images in the absence of paired training data. RegCGAN is based on the conditional GAN, and we introduce two regularizers to guide the model to learn the corresponding semantics of different domains. We evaluate the proposed model on several tasks for which paired training data is not given, including the generation of edges and photos, the generation of faces with different attributes, etc. The experimental results show that our model can successfully generate corresponding images for all these tasks, while outperforms the baseline methods. We also introduce an approach of applying RegCGAN to unsupervised domain adaptation. 
### 120.Deep Ordinal Hashing with Spatial Attention [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02459.pdf)
> Hashing has attracted increasing research attentions in recent years due to its high efficiency of computation and storage in image retrieval. Recent works have demonstrated the superiority of simultaneous feature representations and hash functions learning with deep neural networks. However, most existing deep hashing methods directly learn the hash functions by encoding the global semantic information, while ignoring the local spatial information of images. The loss of local spatial structure makes the performance bottleneck of hash functions, therefore limiting its application for accurate similarity retrieval. In this work, we propose a novel Deep Ordinal Hashing (DOH) method, which learns ordinal representations by leveraging the ranking structure of feature space from both local and global views. In particular, to effectively build the ranking structure, we propose to learn the rank correlation space by exploiting the local spatial information from Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and the global semantic information from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) simultaneously. More specifically, an effective spatial attention model is designed to capture the local spatial information by selectively learning well-specified locations closely related to target objects. In such hashing framework,the local spatial and global semantic nature of images are captured in an end-to-end ranking-to-hashing manner. Experimental results conducted on three widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed DOH method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods. 
### 121.Comparative evaluation of instrument segmentation and tracking methods  in minimally invasive surgery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02475.pdf)
> Intraoperative segmentation and tracking of minimally invasive instruments is a prerequisite for computer- and robotic-assisted surgery. Since additional hardware like tracking systems or the robot encoders are cumbersome and lack accuracy, surgical vision is evolving as promising techniques to segment and track the instruments using only the endoscopic images. However, what is missing so far are common image data sets for consistent evaluation and benchmarking of algorithms against each other. The paper presents a comparative validation study of different vision-based methods for instrument segmentation and tracking in the context of robotic as well as conventional laparoscopic surgery. The contribution of the paper is twofold: we introduce a comprehensive validation data set that was provided to the study participants and present the results of the comparative validation study. Based on the results of the validation study, we arrive at the conclusion that modern deep learning approaches outperform other methods in instrument segmentation tasks, but the results are still not perfect. Furthermore, we show that merging results from different methods actually significantly increases accuracy in comparison to the best stand-alone method. On the other hand, the results of the instrument tracking task show that this is still an open challenge, especially during challenging scenarios in conventional laparoscopic surgery. 
### 122.MEGAN: Mixture of Experts of Generative Adversarial Networks for  Multimodal Image Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02481.pdf)
> Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown promising performance in generating realistic images. However, they often struggle in learning complex underlying modalities in a given dataset, resulting in poor-quality generated images. To mitigate this problem, we present a novel approach called mixture of experts GAN (MEGAN), an ensemble approach of multiple generator networks. Each generator network in MEGAN specializes in generating images with a particular subset of modalities, e.g., an image class. Instead of incorporating a separate step of handcrafted clustering of multiple modalities, our proposed model is trained through an end-to-end learning of multiple generators via gating networks, which is responsible for choosing the appropriate generator network for a given condition. We adopt the categorical reparameterization trick for a categorical decision to be made in selecting a generator while maintaining the flow of the gradients. We demonstrate that individual generators learn different and salient subparts of the data and achieve a multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) score of 0.2470 for CelebA and a competitive unsupervised inception score of 8.33 in CIFAR-10. 
### 123.Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding on Statistical Manifolds [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02505.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel information theoretic framework for dictionary learning (DL) and sparse coding (SC) on a statistical manifold (the manifold of probability distributions). Unlike the traditional DL and SC framework, our new formulation does not explicitly incorporate any sparsity inducing norm in the cost function being optimized but yet yields sparse codes. Our algorithm approximates the data points on the statistical manifold (which are probability distributions) by the weighted Kullback-Leibeler center/mean (KL-center) of the dictionary atoms. The KL-center is defined as the minimizer of the maximum KL-divergence between itself and members of the set whose center is being sought. Further, we prove that the weighted KL-center is a sparse combination of the dictionary atoms. This result also holds for the case when the KL-divergence is replaced by the well known Hellinger distance. From an applications perspective, we present an extension of the aforementioned framework to the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices (which can be identified with the manifold of zero mean gaussian distributions), $\mathcal{P}_n$. We present experiments involving a variety of dictionary-based reconstruction and classification problems in Computer Vision. Performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it to several state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction and classification accuracy as well as sparsity of the chosen representation. 
### 124.Long-Term Human Motion Prediction by Modeling Motion Context and  Enhancing Motion Dynamic [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02513.pdf)
> Human motion prediction aims at generating future frames of human motion based on an observed sequence of skeletons. Recent methods employ the latest hidden states of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode the historical skeletons, which can only address short-term prediction. In this work, we propose a motion context modeling by summarizing the historical human motion with respect to the current prediction. A modified highway unit (MHU) is proposed for efficiently eliminating motionless joints and estimating next pose given the motion context. Furthermore, we enhance the motion dynamic by minimizing the gram matrix loss for long-term motion prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed model can promisingly forecast the human future movements, which yields superior performances over related state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, specifying the motion context with the activity labels enables our model to perform human motion transfer. 
### 125.Detecting Traffic Lights by Single Shot Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02523.pdf)
> Recent improvements in object detection are driven by the success of convolutional neural networks (CNN). They are able to learn rich features outperforming hand-crafted features. So far, research in traffic light detection mainly focused on hand-crafted features, such as color, shape or brightness of the traffic light bulb. This paper presents a deep learning approach for accurate traffic light detection in adapting a single shot detection (SSD) approach. SSD performs object proposals creation and classification using a single CNN. The original SSD struggles in detecting very small objects, which is essential for traffic light detection. By our adaptations it is possible to detect objects much smaller than ten pixels without increasing the input image size. We present an extensive evaluation on the DriveU Traffic Light Dataset (DTLD). We reach both, high accuracy and low false positive rates. The trained model is real-time capable with ten frames per second on a Nvidia Titan Xp. Code has been made available at <a href="https://github.com/julimueller/tl_ssd.">this https URL</a> 
### 126.Near-drowning Early Prediction Technique Using Novel Equations (NEPTUNE)  for Swimming Pools [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02530.pdf)
> Safety is a critical aspect in all swimming pools. This paper describes a near drowning early prediction technique using novel equations (NEPTUNE). NEPTUNE uses equations or rules that would be able to detect near drowning using at least 1 but not more than 5 seconds of video sequence with no false positives. The backbone of NEPTUNE encompasses a mix of statistical image processing to merge images for a video sequence followed by K means clustering to extract segments in the merged image and finally a revisit to statistical image processing to derive variables for every segment. These variables would be used by the equations to identify near-drowning. NEPTUNE has the potential to be integrated into a swimming pool camera system that would send an alarm to the lifeguards for early response so that the likelihood of recovery is high. 
### 127.A probabilistic framework for handwritten text line segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02536.pdf)
> We successfully combine Expectation-Maximization algorithm and variational approaches for parameter learning and computing inference on Markov random felds. This is a general method that can be applied to many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we apply it to handwritten text line segmentation. We conduct several experiments that demonstrate that our method deal with common issues of this task, such as complex document layout or non-latin scripts. The obtained results prove that our method achieve state-of-the-art performance on different benchmark datasets without any particular fine tuning step. 
### 128.Trajectory Representation and Landmark Projection for Continuous-Time  Structure from Motion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02543.pdf)
> This paper revisits the problem of continuous-time structure from motion, and introduces a number of extensions that improve convergence and efficiency. The formulation with a $\mathcal{C}^2$-continuous spline for the trajectory naturally incorporates inertial measurements, as derivatives of the sought trajectory. We analyse the behaviour of split interpolation on $\mathbb{SO}(3)$ and on $\mathbb{R}^3$, and a joint interpolation on $\mathbb{SE}(3)$, and show that the latter implicitly couples the direction of translation and rotation. Such an assumption can make good sense for a camera mounted on a robot arm, but not for hand-held or body-mounted cameras. Our experiments show that split interpolation on $\mathbb{SO}(3)$ and on $\mathbb{R}^3$ is preferable over $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ interpolation in all tested cases. Finally, we investigate the problem of landmark reprojection on rolling shutter cameras, and show that the tested reprojection methods give similar quality, while their computational load varies by a factor of 2. 
### 129.Skeleton-Based Relational Modeling for Action Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02556.pdf)
> With the fast development of effective and low-cost human skeleton capture systems, skeleton-based action recognition has attracted much attention recently. Most existing methods use Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) to extract spatio-temporal information embedded in the skeleton sequences for action recognition. However, these approaches are limited in the ability of relational modeling in a single skeleton, due to the loss of important structural information when converting the raw skeleton data to adapt to the CNN or RNN input. In this paper, we propose an Attentional Recurrent Relational Network-LSTM(ARRN-LSTM) to simultaneously model spatial configurations and temporal dynamics in skeletons for action recognition. The spatial patterns embedded in a single skeleton are learned by a Recurrent Relational Network, followed by a multi-layer LSTM to extract temporal features in the skeleton sequences. To exploit the complementarity between different geometries in the skeleton for sufficient relational modeling, we design a two-stream architecture to learn the relationship among joints and explore the underlying patterns among lines simultaneously. We also introduce an adaptive attentional module for focusing on potential discriminative parts of the skeleton towards a certain action. Extensive experiments are performed on several popular action recognition datasets and the results show that the proposed approach achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 130.30m resolution Global Annual Burned Area Mapping based on Landsat images  and Google Earth Engine [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02579.pdf)
> Heretofore, global burned area (BA) products are only available at coarse spatial resolution, since most of the current global BA products are produced with the help of active fire detection or dense time-series change analysis, which requires very high temporal resolution. In this study, however, we focus on automated global burned area mapping approach based on Landsat images. By utilizing the huge catalog of satellite imagery as well as the high-performance computing capacity of Google Earth Engine, we proposed an automated pipeline for generating 30-meter resolution global-scale annual burned area map from time-series of Landsat images, and a novel 30-meter resolution global annual burned area map of 2015 (GABAM 2015) is released. GABAM 2015 consists of spatial extent of fires that occurred during 2015 and not of fires that occurred in previous years. Cross-comparison with recent Fire_cci version 5.0 BA product found a similar spatial distribution and a strong correlation ($R^2=0.74$) between the burned areas from the two products, although differences were found in specific land cover categories (particularly in agriculture land). Preliminary global validation showed the commission and omission error of GABAM 2015 are 13.17% and 30.13%, respectively. 
### 131.Label Refinery: Improving ImageNet Classification through Label  Progression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02641.pdf)
> Among the three main components (data, labels, and models) of any supervised learning system, data and models have been the main subjects of active research. However, studying labels and their properties has received very little attention. Current principles and paradigms of labeling impose several challenges to machine learning algorithms. Labels are often incomplete, ambiguous, and redundant. In this paper we study the effects of various properties of labels and introduce the Label Refinery: an iterative procedure that updates the ground truth labels after examining the entire dataset. We show significant gain using refined labels across a wide range of models. Using a Label Refinery improves the state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of (1) AlexNet from 59.3 to 67.2, (2) MobileNet from 70.6 to 73.39, (3) MobileNet-0.25 from 50.6 to 55.59, (4) VGG19 from 72.7 to 75.46, and (5) Darknet19 from 72.9 to 74.47. 
### 132.Multichannel Distributed Local Pattern for Content Based Indexing and  Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02679.pdf)
> A novel color feature descriptor, Multichannel Distributed Local Pattern (MDLP) is proposed in this manuscript. The MDLP combines the salient features of both local binary and local mesh patterns in the neighborhood. The multi-distance information computed by the MDLP aids in robust extraction of the texture arrangement. Further, MDLP features are extracted for each color channel of an image. The retrieval performance of the MDLP is evaluated on the three benchmark datasets for CBIR, namely Corel-5000, Corel-10000 and MIT-Color Vistex respectively. The proposed technique attains substantial improvement as compared to other state-of- the-art feature descriptors in terms of various evaluation parameters such as ARP and ARR on the respective databases. 
### 133.Image Super-Resolution via Dual-State Recurrent Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02704.pdf)
> Advances in image super-resolution (SR) have recently benefited significantly from rapid developments in deep neural networks. Inspired by these recent discoveries, we note that many state-of-the-art deep SR architectures can be reformulated as a single-state recurrent neural network (RNN) with finite unfoldings. In this paper, we explore new structures for SR based on this compact RNN view, leading us to a dual-state design, the Dual-State Recurrent Network (DSRN). Compared to its single state counterparts that operate at a fixed spatial resolution, DSRN exploits both low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) signals jointly. Recurrent signals are exchanged between these states in both directions (both LR to HR and HR to LR) via delayed feedback. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets and on a recent challenge demonstrate that the proposed DSRN performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both memory consumption and predictive accuracy. 
### 134.Synaptic Cleft Segmentation in Non-Isotropic Volume Electron Microscopy  of the Complete Drosophila Brain [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02718.pdf)
> Neural circuit reconstruction at single synapse resolution is increasingly recognized as crucially important to decipher the function of biological nervous systems. Volume electron microscopy in serial transmission or scanning mode has been demonstrated to provide the necessary resolution to segment or trace all neurites and to annotate all synaptic connections. <br />Automatic annotation of synaptic connections has been done successfully in near isotropic electron microscopy of vertebrate model organisms. Results on non-isotropic data in insect models, however, are not yet on par with human annotation. <br />We designed a new 3D-U-Net architecture to optimally represent isotropic fields of view in non-isotropic data. We used regression on a signed distance transform of manually annotated synaptic clefts of the CREMI challenge dataset to train this model and observed significant improvement over the state of the art. <br />We developed open source software for optimized parallel prediction on very large volumetric datasets and applied our model to predict synaptic clefts in a 50 tera-voxels dataset of the complete Drosophila brain. Our model generalizes well to areas far away from where training data was available. 
### 135.Building Disease Detection Algorithms with Very Small Numbers of  Positive Samples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02730.pdf)
> Although deep learning can provide promising results in medical image analysis, the lack of very large annotated datasets confines its full potential. Furthermore, limited positive samples also create unbalanced datasets which limit the true positive rates of trained models. As unbalanced datasets are mostly unavoidable, it is greatly beneficial if we can extract useful knowledge from negative samples to improve classification accuracy on limited positive samples. To this end, we propose a new strategy for building medical image analysis pipelines that target disease detection. We train a discriminative segmentation model only on normal images to provide a source of knowledge to be transferred to a disease detection classifier. We show that using the feature maps of a trained segmentation network, deviations from normal anatomy can be learned by a two-class classification network on an extremely unbalanced training dataset with as little as one positive for 17 negative samples. We demonstrate that even though the segmentation network is only trained on normal cardiac computed tomography images, the resulting feature maps can be used to detect pericardial effusion and cardiac septal defects with two-class convolutional classification networks. 
### 136.Learning Optical Flow via Dilated Networks and Occlusion Reasoning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02733.pdf)
> Despite the significant progress that has been made on estimating optical flow recently, most estimation methods, including classical and deep learning approaches, still have difficulty with multi-scale estimation, real-time computation, and/or occlusion reasoning. In this paper, we introduce dilated convolution and occlusion reasoning into unsupervised optical flow estimation to address these issues. The dilated convolution allows our network to avoid upsampling via deconvolution and the resulting gridding artifacts. Dilated convolution also results in a smaller memory footprint which speeds up interference. The occlusion reasoning prevents our network from learning incorrect deformations due to occluded image regions during training. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches on the KITTI benchmark. We also demonstrate its generalization capability by applying it to action recognition in video. 
### 137.FFNet: Video Fast-Forwarding via Reinforcement Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02792.pdf)
> For many applications with limited computation, communication, storage and energy resources, there is an imperative need of computer vision methods that could select an informative subset of the input video for efficient processing at or near real time. In the literature, there are two relevant groups of approaches: generating a trailer for a video or fast-forwarding while watching/processing the video. The first group is supported by video summarization techniques, which require processing of the entire video to select an important subset for showing to users. In the second group, current fast-forwarding methods depend on either manual control or automatic adaptation of playback speed, which often do not present an accurate representation and may still require processing of every frame. In this paper, we introduce FastForwardNet (FFNet), a reinforcement learning agent that gets inspiration from video summarization and does fast-forwarding differently. It is an online framework that automatically fast-forwards a video and presents a representative subset of frames to users on the fly. It does not require processing the entire video, but just the portion that is selected by the fast-forward agent, which makes the process very computationally efficient. The online nature of our proposed method also enables the users to begin fast-forwarding at any point of the video. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can provide better representation of the input video with much less processing requirement. 
### 138.Combo Loss: Handling Input and Output Imbalance in Multi-Organ  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02798.pdf)
> Simultaneous segmentation of multiple organs from different medical imaging modalities is a crucial task as it can be utilized for computer-aided diagnosis, computer-assisted surgery, and therapy planning. Thanks to the recent advances in deep learning, several deep neural networks for medical image segmentation have been introduced successfully for this purpose. In this paper, we focus on learning a deep multi-organ segmentation network that labels voxels. In particular, we examine the critical choice of a loss function in order to handle the notorious imbalance problem that plagues both the input and output of a learning model. The input imbalance refers to the class-imbalance in the input training samples (i.e. small foreground objects embedded in an abundance of background voxels, as well as organs of varying sizes). The output imbalance refers to the imbalance between the false positives and false negatives of the inference model. We introduce a loss function that integrates a weighted cross-entropy with a Dice similarity coefficient to tackle both types of imbalance during training and inference. We evaluated the proposed loss function on three datasets of whole body PET scans with 5 target organs, MRI prostate scans, and ultrasound echocardigraphy images with a single target organ. We show that a simple network architecture with the proposed integrative loss function can outperform state-of-the-art methods and results of the competing methods can be improved when our proposed loss is used. 
### 139.N2RPP: An Adversarial Network to Rebuild Plantar Pressure for ACLD  Patients [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02825.pdf)
> Foot is a vital part of human, and lots of valuable information is embedded. Plantar pressure is one of which contains this information and it describes human walking features. It is proved that once one has trouble with lower limb, the distribution of plantar pressure will change to some degree. Plantar pressure can be converted into images according to some simple standards. In this paper, we take full advantage of these plantar pressure images for medical usage. We present N2RPP, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based method to rebuild plantar pressure images of anterior cruciate ligament deficiency (ACLD) patients from low dimension features, which are extracted from an autoencoder. Through the result of experiments, the extracted features are a useful representation to describe and rebuild plantar pressure images. According to N2RPP's results, we find out that there are several noteworthy differences between normal people and patients. This can provide doctors a rough direction of adjusting plantar pressure to a better distribution to reduce patients' sore and pain during the rehabilitation treatment for ACLD. 
### 140.Weakly-Supervised Video Object Grounding from Text by Loss Weighting and  Object Interaction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02834.pdf)
> We study weakly-supervised video object grounding: given a video segment and a corresponding descriptive sentence, the goal is to localize objects that are mentioned from the sentence in the video. During training, no object bounding boxes are available, but the set of possible objects to be grounded is known beforehand. Existing approaches in the image domain use Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to ground objects by enforcing matches between visual and semantic features. A naive extension of this approach to the video domain is to treat the entire segment as a bag of spatial object proposals. However, an object existing sparsely across multiple frames might not be detected completely since successfully spotting it from one single frame would trigger a satisfactory match. To this end, we propagate the weak supervisory signal from the segment level to frames that likely contain the target object. For frames that are unlikely to contain the target objects, we use an alternative penalty loss. We also leverage the interactions among objects as a textual guide for the grounding. We evaluate our model on the newly-collected benchmark YouCook2-BoundingBox and show improvements over competitive baselines. 
### 141.A Memory Network Approach for Story-based Temporal Summarization of  360&#xb0; Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02838.pdf)
> We address the problem of story-based temporal summarization of long 360{\deg} videos. We propose a novel memory network model named Past-Future Memory Network (PFMN), in which we first compute the scores of 81 normal field of view (NFOV) region proposals cropped from the input 360{\deg} video, and then recover a latent, collective summary using the network with two external memories that store the embeddings of previously selected subshots and future candidate subshots. Our major contributions are two-fold. First, our work is the first to address story-based temporal summarization of 360{\deg} videos. Second, our model is the first attempt to leverage memory networks for video summarization tasks. For evaluation, we perform three sets of experiments. First, we investigate the view selection capability of our model on the Pano2Vid dataset. Second, we evaluate the temporal summarization with a newly collected 360{\deg} video dataset. Finally, we experiment our model's performance in another domain, with image-based storytelling VIST dataset. We verify that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the tasks. 
### 142.Tile2Vec: Unsupervised representation learning for spatially distributed  data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02855.pdf)
> Geospatial analysis lacks methods like the word vector representations and pre-trained networks that significantly boost performance across a wide range of natural language and computer vision tasks. To fill this gap, we introduce Tile2Vec, an unsupervised representation learning algorithm that extends the distributional hypothesis from natural language -- words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings -- to spatially distributed data. We demonstrate empirically that Tile2Vec learns semantically meaningful representations on three datasets. Our learned representations significantly improve performance in downstream classification tasks and, similar to word vectors, visual analogies can be obtained via simple arithmetic in the latent space. 
### 143.Visual Attribute-augmented Three-dimensional Convolutional Neural  Network for Enhanced Human Action Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02860.pdf)
> Visual attributes in individual video frames, such as the presence of characteristic objects and scenes, offer substantial information for action recognition in videos. With individual 2D video frame as input, visual attributes extraction could be achieved effectively and efficiently with more sophisticated convolutional neural network than current 3D CNNs with spatio-temporal filters, thanks to fewer parameters in 2D CNNs. In this paper, the integration of visual attributes (including detection, encoding and classification) into multi-stream 3D CNN is proposed for action recognition in trimmed videos, with the proposed visual Attribute-augmented 3D CNN (A3D) framework. The visual attribute pipeline includes an object detection network, an attributes encoding network and a classification network. Our proposed A3D framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the HMDB51 and the UCF101 datasets. 
### 144.Low-Latency Human Action Recognition with Weighted Multi-Region  Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02877.pdf)
> Spatio-temporal contexts are crucial in understanding human actions in videos. Recent state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) based action recognition systems frequently involve 3D spatio-temporal ConvNet filters, chunking videos into fixed length clips and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Such architectures are designed to take advantage of both short term and long term temporal contexts, but also requires the accumulation of a predefined number of video frames (e.g., to construct video clips for 3D ConvNet filters, to generate enough inputs for LSTMs). For applications that require low-latency online predictions of fast-changing action scenes, a new action recognition system is proposed in this paper. Termed "Weighted Multi-Region Convolutional Neural Network" (WMR ConvNet), the proposed system is LSTM-free, and is based on 2D ConvNet that does not require the accumulation of video frames for 3D ConvNet filtering. Unlike early 2D ConvNets that are based purely on RGB frames and optical flow frames, the WMR ConvNet is designed to simultaneously capture multiple spatial and short term temporal cues (e.g., human poses, occurrences of objects in the background) with both the primary region (foreground) and secondary regions (mostly background). On both the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, the proposed WMR ConvNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance among competing low-latency algorithms. Furthermore, WMR ConvNet even outperforms the 3D ConvNet based C3D algorithm that requires video frame accumulation. In an ablation study with the optical flow ConvNet stream removed, the ablated WMR ConvNet nevertheless outperforms competing algorithms. 
### 145.Image Ordinal Classification and Understanding: Grid Dropout with  Masking Label [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02901.pdf)
> Image ordinal classification refers to predicting a discrete target value which carries ordering correlation among image categories. The limited size of labeled ordinal data renders modern deep learning approaches easy to overfit. To tackle this issue, neuron dropout and data augmentation were proposed which, however, still suffer from over-parameterization and breaking spatial structure, respectively. To address the issues, we first propose a grid dropout method that randomly dropout/blackout some areas of the raining image. Then we combine the objective of predicting the blackout patches with classification to take advantage of the spatial information. Finally we demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches by visualizing the Class Activation Map (CAM) and discover that grid dropout is more aware of the whole facial areas and more robust than neuron dropout for small training dataset. Experiments are conducted on a challenging age estimation dataset - Adience dataset with very competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods. 
### 146.Learning Short-Cut Connections for Object Counting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02919.pdf)
> Object counting is an important task in computer vision due to its growing demand in applications such as traffic monitoring or surveillance. In this paper, we consider object counting as a learning problem of a joint feature extraction and pixel-wise object density estimation with Convolutional-Deconvolutional networks. We propose a novel counting model, named Gated U-Net (GU-Net). Specifically, we propose to enrich the U-Net architecture with the concept of learnable short-cut connections. Standard short-cut connections are connections between layers in deep neural networks which skip at least one intermediate layer. Instead of simply setting short-cut connections, we propose to learn these connections from data. Therefore, our short-cut can work as a gating unit, which optimizes the flow of information between convolutional and deconvolutional layers in the U-Net architecture. We evaluate the proposed GU-Net architecture on three commonly used benchmark data sets for object counting. GU-Nets consistently outperform the base U-Net architecture, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. 
### 147.Comparing phonemes and visemes with DNN-based lipreading [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02924.pdf)
> There is debate if phoneme or viseme units are the most effective for a lipreading system. Some studies use phoneme units even though phonemes describe unique short sounds; other studies tried to improve lipreading accuracy by focusing on visemes with varying results. We compare the performance of a lipreading system by modeling visual speech using either 13 viseme or 38 phoneme units. We report the accuracy of our system at both word and unit levels. The evaluation task is large vocabulary continuous speech using the TCD-TIMIT corpus. We complete our visual speech modeling via hybrid DNN-HMMs and our visual speech decoder is a Weighted Finite-State Transducer (WFST). We use DCT and Eigenlips as a representation of mouth ROI image. The phoneme lipreading system word accuracy outperforms the viseme based system word accuracy. However, the phoneme system achieved lower accuracy at the unit level which shows the importance of the dictionary for decoding classification outputs into words. 
### 148.Phoneme-to-viseme mappings: the good, the bad, and the ugly [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02934.pdf)
> Visemes are the visual equivalent of phonemes. Although not precisely defined, a working definition of a viseme is "a set of phonemes which have identical appearance on the lips". Therefore a phoneme falls into one viseme class but a viseme may represent many phonemes: a many to one mapping. This mapping introduces ambiguity between phonemes when using viseme classifiers. Not only is this ambiguity damaging to the performance of audio-visual classifiers operating on real expressive speech, there is also considerable choice between possible mappings. In this paper we explore the issue of this choice of viseme-to-phoneme map. We show that there is definite difference in performance between viseme-to-phoneme mappings and explore why some maps appear to work better than others. We also devise a new algorithm for constructing phoneme-to-viseme mappings from labeled speech data. These new visemes, `Bear' visemes, are shown to perform better than previously known units. 
### 149.Moir&#xe9; Photo Restoration Using Multiresolution Convolutional Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02996.pdf)
> Digital cameras and mobile phones enable us to conveniently record precious moments. While digital image quality is constantly being improved, taking high-quality photos of digital screens still remains challenging because the photos are often contaminated with moir\'{e} patterns, a result of the interference between the pixel grids of the camera sensor and the device screen. Moir\'{e} patterns can severely damage the visual quality of photos. However, few studies have aimed to solve this problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel multiresolution fully convolutional network for automatically removing moir\'{e} patterns from photos. Since a moir\'{e} pattern spans over a wide range of frequencies, our proposed network performs a nonlinear multiresolution analysis of the input image before computing how to cancel moir\'{e} artefacts within every frequency band. We also create a large-scale benchmark dataset with $100,000^+$ image pairs for investigating and evaluating moir\'{e} pattern removal algorithms. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on this dataset in comparison to existing learning architectures for image restoration problems. 
### 150.Category-Based Deep CCA for Fine-Grained Venue Discovery from Multimodal  Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02997.pdf)
> In this work, travel destination and business location are taken as venues. Discovering a venue by a photo is very important for context-aware applications. Unfortunately, few efforts paid attention to complicated real images such as venue photos generated by users. Our goal is fine-grained venue discovery from heterogeneous social multimodal data. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning model, Category-based Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (C-DCCA). Given a photo as input, this model performs (i) exact venue search (find the venue where the photo was taken), and (ii) group venue search (find relevant venues with the same category as that of the photo), by the cross-modal correlation between the input photo and textual description of venues. In this model, data in different modalities are projected to a same space via deep networks. Pairwise correlation (between different modal data from the same venue) for exact venue search and category-based correlation (between different modal data from different venues with the same category) for group venue search are jointly optimized. Because a photo cannot fully reflect rich text description of a venue, the number of photos per venue in the training phase is increased to capture more aspects of a venue. We build a new venue-aware multimodal dataset by integrating Wikipedia featured articles and Foursquare venue photos. Experimental results on this dataset confirm the feasibility of the proposed method. Moreover, the evaluation over another publicly available dataset confirms that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-arts for cross-modal retrieval between image and text. 
### 151.Towards Accurate and High-Speed Spiking Neuromorphic Systems with Data  Quantization-Aware Deep Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03054.pdf)
> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained immense success in cognitive applications and greatly pushed today's artificial intelligence forward. The biggest challenge in executing DNNs is their extremely data-extensive computations. The computing efficiency in speed and energy is constrained when traditional computing platforms are employed in such computational hungry executions. Spiking neuromorphic computing (SNC) has been widely investigated in deep networks implementation own to their high efficiency in computation and communication. However, weights and signals of DNNs are required to be quantized when deploying the DNNs on the SNC, which results in unacceptable accuracy loss. %However, the system accuracy is limited by quantizing data directly in deep networks deployment. Previous works mainly focus on weights discretize while inter-layer signals are mainly neglected. In this work, we propose to represent DNNs with fixed integer inter-layer signals and fixed-point weights while holding good accuracy. We implement the proposed DNNs on the memristor-based SNC system as a deployment example. With 4-bit data representation, our results show that the accuracy loss can be controlled within 0.02% (2.3%) on MNIST (CIFAR-10). Compared with the 8-bit dynamic fixed-point DNNs, our system can achieve more than 9.8x speedup, 89.1% energy saving, and 30% area saving. 
### 152.Recurrent CNN for 3D Gaze Estimation using Appearance and Shape Cues [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03064.pdf)
> Gaze behavior is an important non-verbal cue in social signal processing and human-computer interaction. In this paper, we tackle the problem of person- and head pose-independent 3D gaze estimation from remote cameras, using a multi-modal recurrent convolutional neural network (CNN). We propose to combine face, eyes region, and face landmarks as individual streams in a CNN to estimate gaze in still images. Then, we exploit the dynamic nature of gaze by feeding the learned features of all the frames in a sequence to a many-to-one recurrent module that predicts the 3D gaze vector of the last frame. Our multi-modal static solution is evaluated on a wide range of head poses and gaze directions, achieving a significant improvement of 14.6% over the state of the art on EYEDIAP dataset, further improved by 4% when the temporal modality is included. 
### 153.Active Object Reconstruction Using a Guided View Planner [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03081.pdf)
> Inspired by the recent advance of image-based object reconstruction using deep learning, we present an active reconstruction model using a guided view planner. We aim to reconstruct a 3D model using images observed from a planned sequence of informative and discriminative views. But where are such informative and discriminative views around an object? To address this we propose a unified model for view planning and object reconstruction, which is utilized to learn a guided information acquisition model and to aggregate information from a sequence of images for reconstruction. Experiments show that our model (1) increases our reconstruction accuracy with an increasing number of views (2) and generally predicts a more informative sequence of views for object reconstruction compared to other alternative methods. 
### 154.Fast Feature Extraction with CNNs with Pooling Layers [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03096.pdf)
> In recent years, many publications showed that convolutional neural network based features can have a superior performance to engineered features. However, not much effort was taken so far to extract local features efficiently for a whole image. In this paper, we present an approach to compute patch-based local feature descriptors efficiently in presence of pooling and striding layers for whole images at once. Our approach is generic and can be applied to nearly all existing network architectures. This includes networks for all local feature extraction tasks like camera calibration, Patchmatching, optical flow estimation and stereo matching. In addition, our approach can be applied to other patch-based approaches like sliding window object detection and recognition. We complete our paper with a speed benchmark of popular CNN based feature extraction approaches applied on a whole image, with and without our speedup, and example code (for Torch) that shows how an arbitrary CNN architecture can be easily converted by our approach. 
### 155.Learning on the Edge: Explicit Boundary Handling in CNNs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03106.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) handle the case where filters extend beyond the image boundary using several heuristics, such as zero, repeat or mean padding. These schemes are applied in an ad-hoc fashion and, being weakly related to the image content and oblivious of the target task, result in low output quality at the boundary. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective improvement that learns the boundary handling itself. At training-time, the network is provided with a separate set of explicit boundary filters. At testing-time, we use these filters which have learned to extrapolate features at the boundary in an optimal way for the specific task. Our extensive evaluation, over a wide range of architectural changes (variations of layers, feature channels, or both), shows how the explicit filters result in improved boundary handling. Consequently, we demonstrate an improvement of 5% to 20% across the board of typical CNN applications (colorization, de-Bayering, optical flow, and disparity estimation). 
### 156.Image Retrieval with Mixed Initiative and Multimodal Feedback [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03134.pdf)
> How would you search for a unique, fashionable shoe that a friend wore and you want to buy, but you didn't take a picture? Existing approaches propose interactive image search as a promising venue. However, they either entrust the user with taking the initiative to provide informative feedback, or give all control to the system which determines informative questions to ask. Instead, we propose a mixed-initiative framework where both the user and system can be active participants, depending on whose initiative will be more beneficial for obtaining high-quality search results. We develop a reinforcement learning approach which dynamically decides which of three interaction opportunities to give to the user: drawing a sketch, providing free-form attribute feedback, or answering attribute-based questions. By allowing these three options, our system optimizes both the informativeness and exploration capabilities allowing faster image retrieval. We outperform three baselines on three datasets and extensive experimental settings. 
### 157.High-resolution medical image synthesis using progressively grown  generative adversarial networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03144.pdf)
> Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms that can produce realistic images from randomly-sampled vectors in a multi-dimensional space. Until recently, it was not possible to generate realistic high-resolution images using GANs, which has limited their applicability to medical images that contain biomarkers only detectable at native resolution. Progressive growing of GANs is an approach wherein an image generator is trained to initially synthesize low resolution synthetic images (8x8 pixels), which are then fed to a discriminator that distinguishes these synthetic images from real downsampled images. Additional convolutional layers are then iteratively introduced to produce images at twice the previous resolution until the desired resolution is reached. In this work, we demonstrate that this approach can produce realistic medical images in two different domains; fundus photographs exhibiting vascular pathology associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and multi-modal magnetic resonance images of glioma. We also show that fine-grained details associated with pathology, such as retinal vessels or tumor heterogeneity, can be preserved and enhanced by including segmentation maps as additional channels. We envisage several applications of the approach, including image augmentation and unsupervised classification of pathology. 
### 158.PAD-Net: A Perception-Aided Single Image Dehazing Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03146.pdf)
> In this work, we investigate the possibility of replacing the $\ell_2$ loss with perceptually derived loss functions (SSIM, MS-SSIM, etc.) in training an end-to-end dehazing neural network. Objective experimental results suggest that by merely changing the loss function we can obtain significantly higher PSNR and SSIM scores on the SOTS set in the RESIDE dataset, compared with a state-of-the-art end-to-end dehazing neural network (AOD-Net) that uses the $\ell_2$ loss. The best PSNR we obtained was 23.50 (4.2% relative improvement), and the best SSIM we obtained was 0.8747 (2.3% relative improvement.) 
### 159.Superresolution method for data deconvolution by superposition of point  sources [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03170.pdf)
> In this work we present a new algorithm for data deconvolution that allows the retrieval of the target function with super-resolution with a simple approach that after a precis e measurement of the instrument response function (IRF), the measured data are fit by a superposition of point sources (SUPPOSe) of equal intensity. In this manner only the positions of the sources need to be determined by an algorithm that minimizes the norm of the difference between the measured data and the convolution of the superposed point sources with the IRF. An upper bound for the uncertainty in the position of the sources was derived and two very different experimental situations were used for the test (an optical spectrum and fluorescent microscopy images) showing excellent reconstructions and agreement with the predicted uncertainties, achieving {\lambda}/10 resolution for the microscope and a fivefold improvement in the spectral resolution for the spectrometer. The method also provides a way to determine the optimum number of sources to be used for the fit. 
### 160.Learning image-to-image translation using paired and unpaired training  samples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03189.pdf)
> Image-to-image translation is a general name for a task where an image from one domain is converted to a corresponding image in another domain, given sufficient training data. Traditionally different approaches have been proposed depending on whether aligned image pairs or two sets of (unaligned) examples from both domains are available for training. While paired training samples might be difficult to obtain, the unpaired setup leads to a highly under-constrained problem and inferior results. In this paper, we propose a new general purpose image-to-image translation model that is able to utilize both paired and unpaired training data simultaneously. We compare our method with two strong baselines and obtain both qualitatively and quantitatively improved results. Our model outperforms the baselines also in the case of purely paired and unpaired training data. To our knowledge, this is the first work to consider such hybrid setup in image-to-image translation. 
### 161.A Mixed Classification-Regression Framework for 3D Pose Estimation from  2D Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03225.pdf)
> 3D pose estimation from a single 2D image is an important and challenging task in computer vision with applications in autonomous driving, robot manipulation and augmented reality. Since 3D pose is a continuous quantity, a natural formulation for this task is to solve a pose regression problem. However, since pose regression methods return a single estimate of the pose, they have difficulties handling multimodal pose distributions (e.g. in the case of symmetric objects). An alternative formulation, which can capture multimodal pose distributions, is to discretize the pose space into bins and solve a pose classification problem. However, pose classification methods can give large pose estimation errors depending on the coarseness of the discretization. In this paper, we propose a mixed classification-regression framework that uses a classification network to produce a discrete multimodal pose estimate and a regression network to produce a continuous refinement of the discrete estimate. The proposed framework can accommodate different architectures and loss functions, leading to multiple classification-regression models, some of which achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Pascal3D+ dataset. 
### 162.Sparse Blind Deconvolution for Distributed Radar Autofocus Imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03269.pdf)
> A common problem that arises in radar imaging systems, especially those mounted on mobile platforms, is antenna position ambiguity. Approaches to resolve this ambiguity and correct position errors are generally known as radar autofocus. Common techniques that attempt to resolve the antenna ambiguity generally assume an unknown gain and phase error afflicting the radar measurements. However, ensuring identifiability and tractability of the unknown error imposes strict restrictions on the allowable antenna perturbations. Furthermore, these techniques are often not applicable in near-field imaging, where mapping the position ambiguity to phase errors breaks down. <br />In this paper, we propose an alternate formulation where the position error of each antenna is mapped to a spatial shift operator in the image-domain. Thus, the radar autofocus problem becomes a multichannel blind deconvolution problem, in which the radar measurements correspond to observations of a static radar image that is convolved with the spatial shift kernel associated with each antenna. To solve the reformulated problem, we also develop a block coordinate descent framework that leverages the sparsity and piece-wise smoothness of the radar scene, as well as the one-sparse property of the two dimensional shift kernels. We evaluate the performance of our approach using both simulated and experimental radar measurements, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. 
### 163.Fully Automated Segmentation of Hyperreflective Foci in Optical  Coherence Tomography Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03278.pdf)
> The automatic detection of disease related entities in retinal imaging data is relevant for disease- and treatment monitoring. It enables the quantitative assessment of large amounts of data and the corresponding study of disease characteristics. The presence of hyperreflective foci (HRF) is related to disease progression in various retinal diseases. Manual identification of HRF in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans is error-prone and tedious. We present a fully automated machine learning approach for segmenting HRF in SD-OCT scans. Evaluation on annotated OCT images of the retina demonstrates that a residual U-Net allows to segment HRF with high accuracy. As our dataset comprised data from different retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion, the algorithm can safely be applied in all of them though different pathophysiological origins are known. 
### 164.Highly Scalable Image Reconstruction using Deep Neural Networks with  Bandpass Filtering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03300.pdf)
> To increase the flexibility and scalability of deep neural networks for image reconstruction, a framework is proposed based on bandpass filtering. For many applications, sensing measurements are performed indirectly. For example, in magnetic resonance imaging, data are sampled in the frequency domain. The introduction of bandpass filtering enables leveraging known imaging physics while ensuring that the final reconstruction is consistent with actual measurements to maintain reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate this flexible architecture for reconstructing subsampled datasets of MRI scans. The resulting high subsampling rates increase the speed of MRI acquisitions and enable the visualization rapid hemodynamics. 
### 165.The Effectiveness of Instance Normalization: a Strong Baseline for  Single Image Dehazing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03305.pdf)
> We propose a novel deep neural network architecture for the challenging problem of single image dehazing, which aims to recover the clear image from a degraded hazy image. Instead of relying on hand-crafted image priors or explicitly estimating the components of the widely used atmospheric scattering model, our end-to-end system directly generates the clear image from an input hazy image. The proposed network has an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections and instance normalization. We adopt the convolutional layers of the pre-trained VGG network as encoder to exploit the representation power of deep features, and demonstrate the effectiveness of instance normalization for image dehazing. Our simple yet effective network outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on the benchmark datasets. 
### 166.Attention-Aware Compositional Network for Person Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03344.pdf)
> Person re-identification (ReID) is to identify pedestrians observed from different camera views based on visual appearance. It is a challenging task due to large pose variations, complex background clutters and severe occlusions. Recently, human pose estimation by predicting joint locations was largely improved in accuracy. It is reasonable to use pose estimation results for handling pose variations and background clutters, and such attempts have obtained great improvement in ReID performance. However, we argue that the pose information was not well utilized and hasn't yet been fully exploited for person ReID. <br />In this work, we introduce a novel framework called Attention-Aware Compositional Network (AACN) for person ReID. AACN consists of two main components: Pose-guided Part Attention (PPA) and Attention-aware Feature Composition (AFC). PPA is learned and applied to mask out undesirable background features in pedestrian feature maps. Furthermore, pose-guided visibility scores are estimated for body parts to deal with part occlusion in the proposed AFC module. Extensive experiments with ablation analysis show the effectiveness of our method, and state-of-the-art results are achieved on several public datasets, including Market-1501, CUHK03, CUHK01, SenseReID, CUHK03-NP and DukeMTMC-reID. 
### 167.SPG-Net: Segmentation Prediction and Guidance Network for Image  Inpainting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03356.pdf)
> In this paper, we focus on image inpainting task, aiming at recovering the missing area of an incomplete image given the context information. Recent development in deep generative models enables an efficient end-to-end framework for image synthesis and inpainting tasks, but existing methods based on generative models don't exploit the segmentation information to constrain the object shapes, which usually lead to blurry results on the boundary. To tackle this problem, we propose to introduce the semantic segmentation information, which disentangles the inter-class difference and intra-class variation for image inpainting. This leads to much clearer recovered boundary between semantically different regions and better texture within semantically consistent segments. Our model factorizes the image inpainting process into segmentation prediction (SP-Net) and segmentation guidance (SG-Net) as two steps, which predict the segmentation labels in the missing area first, and then generate segmentation guided inpainting results. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods in optimizing the image inpainting quality, and the interactive segmentation guidance provides possibilities for multi-modal predictions of image inpainting. 
### 168.Anchor Cascade for Efficient Face Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03363.pdf)
> Face detection is essential to facial analysis tasks such as facial reenactment and face recognition. Both cascade face detectors and anchor-based face detectors have translated shining demos into practice and received intensive attention from the community. However, cascade face detectors often suffer from a low detection accuracy, while anchor-based face detectors rely heavily on very large networks pre-trained on large scale image classification datasets such as ImageNet [1], which is not computationally efficient for both training and deployment. In this paper, we devise an efficient anchor-based cascade framework called anchor cascade. To improve the detection accuracy by exploring contextual information, we further propose a context pyramid maxout mechanism for anchor cascade. As a result, anchor cascade can train very efficient face detection models with a high detection accuracy. Specifically, comparing with a popular CNN-based cascade face detector MTCNN [2], our anchor cascade face detector greatly improves the detection accuracy, e.g., from 0.9435 to 0.9704 at 1k false positives on FDDB, while it still runs in comparable speed. Experimental results on two widely used face detection benchmarks, FDDB and WIDER FACE, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. 
### 169.PSGAN: A Generative Adversarial Network for Remote Sensing Image  Pan-Sharpening [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03371.pdf)
> Remote sensing image fusion (also known as pan-sharpening) aims to generate a high resolution multi-spectral image from inputs of a high spatial resolution single band panchromatic (PAN) image and a low spatial resolution multi-spectral (MS) image. In this paper, we propose PSGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for remote sensing image pan-sharpening. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at producing high quality pan-sharpened images with GANs. The PSGAN consists of two parts. Firstly, a two-stream fusion architecture is designed to generate the desired high resolution multi-spectral images, then a fully convolutional network serving as a discriminator is applied to distinct "real" or "pan-sharpened" MS images. Experiments on images acquired by Quickbird and GaoFen-1 satellites demonstrate that the proposed PSGAN can fuse PAN and MS images effectively and significantly improve the results over the state of the art traditional and CNN based pan-sharpening methods. 
### 170.New Techniques for Preserving Global Structure and Denoising with Low  Information Loss in Single-Image Super-Resolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03383.pdf)
> This work identifies and addresses two important technical challenges in single-image super-resolution: (1) how to upsample an image without magnifying noise and (2) how to preserve large scale structure when upsampling. We summarize the techniques we developed for our second place entry in Track 1 (Bicubic Downsampling), seventh place entry in Track 2 (Realistic Adverse Conditions), and seventh place entry in Track 3 (Realistic difficult) in the 2018 NTIRE Super-Resolution Challenge. Furthermore, we present new neural network architectures that specifically address the two challenges listed above: denoising and preservation of large-scale structure. 
### 171.Edit Probability for Scene Text Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03384.pdf)
> We consider the scene text recognition problem under the attention-based encoder-decoder framework, which is the state of the art. The existing methods usually employ a frame-wise maximal likelihood loss to optimize the models. When we train the model, the misalignment between the ground truth strings and the attention's output sequences of probability distribution, which is caused by missing or superfluous characters, will confuse and mislead the training process, and consequently make the training costly and degrade the recognition accuracy. To handle this problem, we propose a novel method called edit probability (EP) for scene text recognition. EP tries to effectively estimate the probability of generating a string from the output sequence of probability distribution conditioned on the input image, while considering the possible occurrences of missing/superfluous characters. The advantage lies in that the training process can focus on the missing, superfluous and unrecognized characters, and thus the impact of the misalignment problem can be alleviated or even overcome. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including the IIIT-5K, Street View Text and ICDAR datasets. Experimental results show that the EP can substantially boost scene text recognition performance. 
### 172.Deep Directional Statistics: Pose Estimation with Uncertainty  Quantification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03430.pdf)
> Modern deep learning systems successfully solve many perception tasks such as object pose estimation when the input image is of high quality. However, in challenging imaging conditions such as on low-resolution images or when the image is corrupted by imaging artifacts, current systems degrade considerably in accuracy. While a loss in performance is unavoidable, we would like our models to quantify their uncertainty in order to achieve robustness against images of varying quality. Probabilistic deep learning models combine the expressive power of deep learning with uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic deep learning model for the task of angular regression. Our model uses von Mises distributions to predict a distribution over object pose angle. Whereas a single von Mises distribution is making strong assumptions about the shape of the distribution, we extend the basic model to predict a mixture of von Mises distributions. We show how to learn a mixture model using a finite and infinite number of mixture components. Our model allows for likelihood-based training and efficient inference at test time. We demonstrate on a number of challenging pose estimation datasets that our model produces calibrated probability predictions and competitive or superior point estimates compared to the current state-of-the-art. 
### 173.Robust Classification with Convolutional Prototype Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03438.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for image classification. Despite its high accuracies, CNN has been shown to be easily fooled by some adversarial examples, indicating that CNN is not robust enough for pattern classification. In this paper, we argue that the lack of robustness for CNN is caused by the softmax layer, which is a totally discriminative model and based on the assumption of closed world (i.e., with a fixed number of categories). To improve the robustness, we propose a novel learning framework called convolutional prototype learning (CPL). The advantage of using prototypes is that it can well handle the open world recognition problem and therefore improve the robustness. Under the framework of CPL, we design multiple classification criteria to train the network. Moreover, a prototype loss (PL) is proposed as a regularization to improve the intra-class compactness of the feature representation, which can be viewed as a generative model based on the Gaussian assumption of different classes. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that CPL can achieve comparable or even better results than traditional CNN, and from the robustness perspective, CPL shows great advantages for both the rejection and incremental category learning tasks. 
### 174.Object Tracking with Correlation Filters using Selective Single  Background Patch [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03453.pdf)
> Correlation filter plays a major role in improved tracking performance compared to existing trackers. The tracker uses the adaptive correlation response to predict the location of the target. Many varieties of correlation trackers were proposed recently with high accuracy and frame rates. The paper proposes a method to select a single background patch to have a better tracking performance. The paper also contributes a variant of correlation filter by modifying the filter with image restoration filters. The approach is validated using Object Tracking Benchmark sequences. 
### 175.Joint Action Unit localisation and intensity estimation through heatmap  regression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03487.pdf)
> This paper proposes a supervised learning approach to jointly perform facial Action Unit (AU) localisation and intensity estimation. Contrary to previous works that try to learn an unsupervised representation of the Action Unit regions, we propose to directly and jointly estimate all AU intensities through heatmap regression, along with the location in the face where they cause visible changes. Our approach aims to learn a pixel-wise regression function returning a score per AU, which indicates an AU intensity at a given spatial location. Heatmap regression then generates an image, or channel, per AU, in which each pixel indicates the corresponding AU intensity. To generate the ground-truth heatmaps for a target AU, the facial landmarks are first estimated, and a 2D Gaussian is drawn around the points where the AU is known to cause changes. The amplitude and size of the Gaussian is determined by the intensity of the AU. We show that using a single Hourglass network suffices to attain new state of the art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of such a simple approach. The use of heatmap regression allows learning of a shared representation between AUs without the need to rely on latent representations, as these are implicitly learned from the data. We validate the proposed approach on the BP4D dataset, showing a modest improvement on recent, complex, techniques, as well as robustness against misalignment errors. Code for testing and models will be available to download from <a href="https://github.com/ESanchezLozano/Action-Units-Heatmaps.">this https URL</a> 
### 176.Rethinking Diversified and Discriminative Proposal Generation for Visual  Grounding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03508.pdf)
> Visual grounding aims to localize an object in an image referred to by a textual query phrase. Various visual grounding approaches have been proposed, and the problem can be modularized into a general framework: proposal generation, multi-modal feature representation, and proposal ranking. Of these three modules, most existing approaches focus on the latter two, with the importance of proposal generation generally neglected. In this paper, we rethink the problem of what properties make a good proposal generator. We introduce the diversity and discrimination simultaneously when generating proposals, and in doing so propose Diversified and Discriminative Proposal Networks model (DDPN). Based on the proposals generated by DDPN, we propose a high performance baseline model for visual grounding and evaluate it on four benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model delivers significant improvements on all the tested data-sets (e.g., 18.8\% improvement on ReferItGame and 8.2\% improvement on Flickr30k Entities over the existing state-of-the-arts respectively) 
### 177.Deep 2.5D Vehicle Classification with Sparse SfM Depth Prior for  Automated Toll Systems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03511.pdf)
> Automated toll systems rely on proper classification of the passing vehicles. This is especially difficult when the images used for classification only cover parts of the vehicle. To obtain information about the whole vehicle. we reconstruct the vehicle as 3D object and exploit this additional information within a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, when using deep networks for 3D object classification, large amounts of dense 3D models are required for good accuracy, which are often neither available nor feasible to process due to memory requirements. Therefore, in our method we reproject the 3D object onto the image plane using the reconstructed points, lines or both. We utilize this sparse depth prior within an auxiliary network branch that acts as a regularizer during training. We show that this auxiliary regularizer helps to improve accuracy compared to 2D classification on a real-world dataset. Furthermore due to the design of the network, at test time only the 2D camera images are required for classification which enables the usage in portable computer vision systems. 
### 178.FlowFields++: Accurate Optical Flow Correspondences Meet Robust  Interpolation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03517.pdf)
> Optical Flow algorithms are of high importance for many applications. Recently, the Flow Field algorithm and its modifications have shown remarkable results, as they have been evaluated with top accuracy on different data sets. In our analysis of the algorithm we have found that it produces accurate sparse matches, but there is room for improvement in the interpolation. Thus, we propose in this paper FlowFields++, where we combine the accurate matches of Flow Fields with a robust interpolation. In addition, we propose improved variational optimization as post-processing. Our new algorithm is evaluated on the challenging KITTI and MPI Sintel data sets with public top results on both benchmarks. 
### 179.Phase retrieval for Fourier Ptychography under varying amount of  measurements [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03593.pdf)
> Fourier Ptychography is a recently proposed imaging technique that yields high-resolution images by computationally transcending the diffraction blur of an optical system. At the crux of this method is the phase retrieval algorithm, which is used for computationally stitching together low-resolution images taken under varying illumination angles of a coherent light source. However, the traditional iterative phase retrieval technique relies heavily on the initialization and also need a good amount of overlap in the Fourier domain for the successively captured low-resolution images, thus increasing the acquisition time and data. We show that an auto-encoder based architecture can be adaptively trained for phase retrieval under both low overlap, where traditional techniques completely fail, and at higher levels of overlap. For the low overlap case we show that a supervised deep learning technique using an autoencoder generator is a good choice for solving the Fourier ptychography problem. And for the high overlap case, we show that optimizing the generator for reducing the forward model error is an appropriate choice. Using simulations for the challenging case of uncorrelated phase and amplitude, we show that our method outperforms many of the previously proposed Fourier ptychography phase retrieval techniques. 
### 180.Layered Optical Flow Estimation Using a Deep Neural Network with a Soft  Mask [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03596.pdf)
> Using a layered representation for motion estimation has the advantage of being able to cope with discontinuities and occlusions. In this paper, we learn to estimate optical flow by combining a layered motion representation with deep learning. Instead of pre-segmenting the image to layers, the proposed approach automatically generates a layered representation of optical flow using the proposed soft-mask module. The essential components of the soft-mask module are maxout and fuse operations, which enable a disjoint layered representation of optical flow and more accurate flow estimation. We show that by using masks the motion estimate results in a quadratic function of input features in the output layer. The proposed soft-mask module can be added to any existing optical flow estimation networks by replacing their flow output layer. In this work, we use FlowNet as the base network to which we add the soft-mask module. The resulting network is tested on three well-known benchmarks with both supervised and unsupervised flow estimation tasks. Evaluation results show that the proposed network achieve better results compared with the original FlowNet. 
### 181.Fast and Accurate Tumor Segmentation of Histology Images using  Persistent Homology and Deep Convolutional Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03699.pdf)
> Tumor segmentation in whole-slide images of histology slides is an important step towards computer-assisted diagnosis. In this work, we propose a tumor segmentation framework based on the novel concept of persistent homology profiles (PHPs). For a given image patch, the homology profiles are derived by efficient computation of persistent homology, which is an algebraic tool from homology theory. We propose an efficient way of computing topological persistence of an image, alternative to simplicial homology. The PHPs are devised to distinguish tumor regions from their normal counterparts by modeling the atypical characteristics of tumor nuclei. We propose two variants of our method for tumor segmentation: one that targets speed without compromising accuracy and the other that targets higher accuracy. The fast version is based on the selection of exemplar image patches from a convolution neural network (CNN) and patch classification by quantifying the divergence between the PHPs of exemplars and the input image patch. Detailed comparative evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than competing algorithms while achieving comparable results. The accurate version combines the PHPs and high-level CNN features and employs a multi-stage ensemble strategy for image patch labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of PHPs and CNN features outperforms competing algorithms. This study is performed on two independently collected colorectal datasets containing adenoma, adenocarcinoma, signet and healthy cases. Collectively, the accurate tumor segmentation produces the highest average patch-level F1-score, as compared with competing algorithms, on malignant and healthy cases from both the datasets. Overall the proposed framework highlights the utility of persistent homology for histopathology image analysis. 
### 182.Description of a Tracking Metric Inspired by KL-divergence [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03707.pdf)
> A unified metric is given for the evaluation of tracking systems. The metric is inspired by KL-divergence or relative entropy, which is commonly used to evaluate clustering techniques. Since tracking problems are fundamentally different from clustering, the components of KL-divergence are recast to handle various types of tracking errors (i.e., false alarms, missed detections, merges, splits). Preliminary scoring results are given on a standard tracking dataset (Oxford Town Centre Dataset). In the final section, prospective advantages of the metric are listed, along with ideas for improving the metric. We end with a couple of open questions concerning tracking metrics. 
### 183.k-Space Deep Learning for Accelerated MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03779.pdf)
> The annihilating filter-based low-rank Hanel matrix approach (ALOHA) is one of the state-of-the-art compressed sensing approaches that directly interpolates the missing k-space data using low-rank Hankel matrix completion. Inspired by the recent mathematical discovery that links deep neural networks to Hankel matrix decomposition using data-driven framelet basis, here we propose a fully data-driven deep learning algorithm for k-space interpolation. Our network can be also easily applied to non-Cartesian k-space trajectories by simply adding an additional re-gridding layer. Extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed deep learning method significantly outperforms the existing image-domain deep learning approaches. 
### 184.Dust concentration vision measurement based on moment of inertia in gray  level-rank co-occurrence matrix [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03788.pdf)
> To improve the accuracy of existing dust concentration measurements, a dust concentration measurement based on Moment of inertia in Gray level-Rank Co-occurrence Matrix (GRCM), which is from the dust image sample measured by a machine vision system is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a Polynomial computational model between dust Concentration and Moment of inertia (PCM) is established by experimental methods and fitting methods. Then computing methods for GRCM and its Moment of inertia are constructed by theoretical and mathematical analysis methods. And then developing an on-line dust concentration vision measurement experimental system, the cement dust concentration measurement in a cement production workshop is taken as a practice example with the system and the PCM measurement. The results show that measurement error is within 9%, and the measurement range is 0.5-1000 mg/m3. Finally, comparing with the filter membrane weighing measurement, light scattering measurement and laser measurement, the proposed PCM measurement has advantages on error and cost, which can be provided a valuable reference for the dust concentration vision measurements. 
### 185.Avatar-Net: Multi-scale Zero-shot Style Transfer by Feature Decoration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03857.pdf)
> Zero-shot artistic style transfer is an important image synthesis problem aiming at transferring arbitrary style into content images. However, the trade-off between the generalization and efficiency in existing methods impedes a high quality zero-shot style transfer in real-time. In this paper, we resolve this dilemma and propose an efficient yet effective Avatar-Net that enables visually plausible multi-scale transfer for arbitrary style. The key ingredient of our method is a style decorator that makes up the content features by semantically aligned style features from an arbitrary style image, which does not only holistically match their feature distributions but also preserve detailed style patterns in the decorated features. By embedding this module into an image reconstruction network that fuses multi-scale style abstractions, the Avatar-Net renders multi-scale stylization for any style image in one feed-forward pass. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in generating high-quality stylized images, with a series of applications include multiple style integration, video stylization and etc. 
### 186.Deep Covariance Descriptors for Facial Expression Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03869.pdf)
> In this paper, covariance matrices are exploited to encode the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) features for facial expression recognition. The space geometry of the covariance matrices is that of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. By performing the classification of the facial expressions using Gaussian kernel on SPD manifold, we show that the covariance descriptors computed on DCNN features are more efficient than the standard classification with fully connected layers and softmax. By implementing our approach using the VGG-face and ExpNet architectures with extensive experiments on the Oulu-CASIA and SFEW datasets, we show that the proposed approach achieves performance at the state of the art for facial expression recognition. 
### 187.Structure-from-Motion using Dense CNN Features with Keypoint  Relocalization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03879.pdf)
> Structure from Motion (SfM) using imagery that involves extreme appearance changes is yet a challenging task due to a loss of feature repeatability. Using feature correspondences obtained by matching densely extracted convolutional neural network (CNN) features significantly improves the SfM reconstruction capability. However, the reconstruction accuracy is limited by the spatial resolution of the extracted CNN features which is not even pixel-level accuracy in the existing approach. Providing dense feature matches with precise keypoint positions is not trivial because of memory limitation and computational burden of dense features. To achieve accurate SfM reconstruction with highly repeatable dense features, we propose an SfM pipeline that uses dense CNN features with relocalization of keypoint position that can efficiently and accurately provide pixel-level feature correspondences. Then, we demonstrate on the Aachen Day-Night dataset that the proposed SfM using dense CNN features with the keypoint relocalization outperforms a state-of-the-art SfM (COLMAP using RootSIFT) by a large margin. 
### 188.Dealing with sequences in the RGBDT space [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03897.pdf)
> Most of the current research in computer vision is focused on working with single images without taking in account temporal information. We present a probabilistic non-parametric model that mixes multiple information cues from devices to segment regions that contain moving objects in image sequences. We prepared an experimental setup to show the importance of using previous information for obtaining an accurate segmentation result, using a novel dataset that provides sequences in the RGBDT space. We label the detected regions ts with a state-of-the-art human detector. Each one of the detected regions is at least marked as human once. 
### 189.Ensemble Soft-Margin Softmax Loss for Image Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03922.pdf)
> Softmax loss is arguably one of the most popular losses to train CNN models for image classification. However, recent works have exposed its limitation on feature discriminability. This paper casts a new viewpoint on the weakness of softmax loss. On the one hand, the CNN features learned using the softmax loss are often inadequately discriminative. We hence introduce a soft-margin softmax function to explicitly encourage the discrimination between different classes. On the other hand, the learned classifier of softmax loss is weak. We propose to assemble multiple these weak classifiers to a strong one, inspired by the recognition that the diversity among weak classifiers is critical to a good ensemble. To achieve the diversity, we adopt the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). Considering these two aspects in one framework, we design a novel loss, named as Ensemble soft-Margin Softmax (EM-Softmax). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to show the superiority of our design over the baseline softmax loss and several state-of-the-art alternatives. 
### 190.ABMOF: A Novel Optical Flow Algorithm for Dynamic Vision Sensors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03988.pdf)
> Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), which output asynchronous log intensity change events, have potential applications in high-speed robotics, autonomous cars and drones. The precise event timing, sparse output, and wide dynamic range of the events are well suited for optical flow, but conventional optical flow (OF) algorithms are not well matched to the event stream data. This paper proposes an event-driven OF algorithm called adaptive block-matching optical flow (ABMOF). ABMOF uses time slices of accumulated DVS events. The time slices are adaptively rotated based on the input events and OF results. Compared with other methods such as gradient-based OF, ABMOF can efficiently be implemented in compact logic circuits. Results show that ABMOF achieves comparable accuracy to conventional standards such as Lucas-Kanade (LK). The main contributions of our paper are new adaptive time-slice rotation methods that ensure the generated slices have sufficient features for matching,including a feedback mechanism that controls the generated slices to have average slice displacement within the block search range. An LK method using our adapted slices is also implemented. The ABMOF accuracy is compared with this LK method on natural scene data including sparse and dense texture, high dynamic range, and fast motion exceeding 30,000 pixels per second.The paper dataset and source code are available from <a href="http://sensors.ini.uzh.ch/databases.html.">this http URL</a> 
### 191.Multi-View Semantic Labeling of 3D Point Clouds for Automated Plant  Phenotyping [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03994.pdf)
> Semantic labeling of 3D point clouds is important for the derivation of 3D models from real world scenarios in several economic fields such as building industry, facility management, town planning or heritage conservation. In contrast to these most common applications, we describe in this study the semantic labeling of 3D point clouds derived from plant organs by high-precision scanning. Our approach is optimized for the task of plant phenotyping with its very specific challenges and is employing a deep learning framework. Thereby, we report important experiences concerning detailed parameter initialization and optimization techniques. By evaluating our approach with challenging datasets we achieve state-of-the-art results without difficult and time consuming feature engineering as being necessary in traditional approaches to semantic labeling. 
### 192.Dense and Diverse Capsule Networks: Making the Capsules Learn Better [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04001.pdf)
> Past few years have witnessed exponential growth of interest in deep learning methodologies with rapidly improving accuracies and reduced computational complexity. In particular, architectures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have produced state-of-the-art performances for image classification and object recognition tasks. Recently, Capsule Networks (CapsNet) achieved significant increase in performance by addressing an inherent limitation of CNNs in encoding pose and deformation. Inspired by such advancement, we asked ourselves, can we do better? We propose Dense Capsule Networks (DCNet) and Diverse Capsule Networks (DCNet++). The two proposed frameworks customize the CapsNet by replacing the standard convolutional layers with densely connected convolutions. This helps in incorporating feature maps learned by different layers in forming the primary capsules. DCNet, essentially adds a deeper convolution network, which leads to learning of discriminative feature maps. Additionally, DCNet++ uses a hierarchical architecture to learn capsules that represent spatial information in a fine-to-coarser manner, which makes it more efficient for learning complex data. Experiments on image classification task using benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed architectures. DCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance (99.75%) on MNIST dataset with twenty fold decrease in total training iterations, over the conventional CapsNet. Furthermore, DCNet++ performs better than CapsNet on SVHN dataset (96.90%), and outperforms the ensemble of seven CapsNet models on CIFAR-10 by 0.31% with seven fold decrease in number of parameters. 
### 193.Deep Nets: What have they ever done for Vision? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04025.pdf)
> This is an opinion paper about the strengths and weaknesses of Deep Nets. They are at the center of recent progress on Artificial Intelligence and are of growing importance in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience since they enable the development of computational models that can deal with a large range of visually realistic stimuli and visual tasks. They have clear limitations but they also have enormous successes. There is also gradual, though incomplete, understanding of their inner workings. It seems unlikely that Deep Nets in their current form will be the best long-term solution either for building general purpose intelligent machines or for understanding the mind/brain, but it is likely that many aspects of them will remain. At present Deep Nets do very well on specific types of visual tasks and on specific benchmarked datasets. But Deep Nets are much less general purpose, flexible, and adaptive than the human visual system. Moreover, methods like Deep Nets may run into fundamental difficulties when faced with the enormous complexity of natural images. To illustrate our main points, while keeping the references small, this paper is slightly biased towards work from our group. 
### 194.Towards an Unequivocal Representation of Actions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04026.pdf)
> This work introduces verb-only representations for actions and interactions; the problem of describing similar motions (e.g. 'open door', 'open cupboard'), and distinguish differing ones (e.g. 'open door' vs 'open bottle') using verb-only labels. Current approaches for action recognition neglect legitimate semantic ambiguities and class overlaps between verbs (Fig. 1), relying on the objects to disambiguate interactions. We deviate from single-verb labels and introduce a mapping between observations and multiple verb labels - in order to create an Unequivocal Representation of Actions. The new representation benefits from increased vocabulary and a soft assignment to an enriched space of verb labels. We learn these representations as multi-output regression, using a two-stream fusion CNN. The proposed approach outperforms conventional single-verb labels (also known as majority voting) on three egocentric datasets for both recognition and retrieval. 
### 195.Learning to Estimate 3D Human Pose and Shape from a Single Color Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04092.pdf)
> This work addresses the problem of estimating the full body 3D human pose and shape from a single color image. This is a task where iterative optimization-based solutions have typically prevailed, while Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) have suffered because of the lack of training data and their low resolution 3D predictions. Our work aims to bridge this gap and proposes an efficient and effective direct prediction method based on ConvNets. Central part to our approach is the incorporation of a parametric statistical body shape model (SMPL) within our end-to-end framework. This allows us to get very detailed 3D mesh results, while requiring estimation only of a small number of parameters, making it friendly for direct network prediction. Interestingly, we demonstrate that these parameters can be predicted reliably only from 2D keypoints and masks. These are typical outputs of generic 2D human analysis ConvNets, allowing us to relax the massive requirement that images with 3D shape ground truth are available for training. Simultaneously, by maintaining differentiability, at training time we generate the 3D mesh from the estimated parameters and optimize explicitly for the surface using a 3D per-vertex loss. Finally, a differentiable renderer is employed to project the 3D mesh to the image, which enables further refinement of the network, by optimizing for the consistency of the projection with 2D annotations (i.e., 2D keypoints or masks). The proposed approach outperforms previous baselines on this task and offers an attractive solution for direct prediction of 3D shape from a single color image. 
### 196.Ordinal Depth Supervision for 3D Human Pose Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04095.pdf)
> Our ability to train end-to-end systems for 3D human pose estimation from single images is currently constrained by the limited availability of 3D annotations for natural images. Most datasets are captured using Motion Capture (MoCap) systems in a studio setting and it is difficult to reach the variability of 2D human pose datasets, like MPII or LSP. To alleviate the need for accurate 3D ground truth, we propose to use a weaker supervision signal provided by the ordinal depths of human joints. This information can be acquired by human annotators for a wide range of images and poses. We showcase the effectiveness and flexibility of training Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) with these ordinal relations in different settings, always achieving competitive performance with ConvNets trained with accurate 3D joint coordinates. Additionally, to demonstrate the potential of the approach, we augment the popular LSP and MPII datasets with ordinal depth annotations. This extension allows us to present quantitative and qualitative evaluation in non-studio conditions. Simultaneously, these ordinal annotations can be easily incorporated in the training procedure of typical ConvNets for 3D human pose. Through this inclusion we achieve new state-of-the-art performance for the relevant benchmarks and validate the effectiveness of ordinal depth supervision for 3D human pose. 
### 197.Fighting Fake News: Image Splice Detection via Learned Self-Consistency [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04096.pdf)
> Advances in photo editing and manipulation tools have made it significantly easier to create fake imagery. Learning to detect such manipulations, however, remains a challenging problem due to the lack of sufficient amounts of manipulated training data. In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm for detecting visual image manipulations that is trained only using a large dataset of real photographs. The algorithm uses the automatically recorded photo EXIF metadata as supervisory signal for training a model to determine whether an image is self-consistent -- that is, whether its content could have been produced by a single imaging pipeline. We apply this self-consistency model to the task of detecting and localizing image splices. The proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance on several image forensics benchmarks, despite never seeing any manipulated images at training. That said, it is merely a step in the long quest for a truly general purpose visual forensics tool. 
### 198.Arbitrary Style Transfer with Deep Feature Reshuffle [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04103.pdf)
> This paper introduces a novel method by reshuffling deep features (i.e., permuting the spacial locations of a feature map) of the style image for arbitrary style transfer. We theoretically prove that our new style loss based on reshuffle connects both global and local style losses respectively used by most parametric and non-parametric neural style transfer methods. This simple idea can effectively address the challenging issues in existing style transfer methods. On one hand, it can avoid distortions in local style patterns, and allow semantic-level transfer, compared with neural parametric methods. On the other hand, it can preserve globally similar appearance to the style image, and avoid wash-out artifacts, compared with neural non-parametric methods. Based on the proposed loss, we also present a progressive feature-domain optimization approach. The experiments show that our method is widely applicable to various styles, and produces better quality than existing methods. 
### 199.Boosting up Scene Text Detectors with Guided CNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04132.pdf)
> Deep CNNs have achieved great success in text detection. Most of existing methods attempt to improve accuracy with sophisticated network design, while paying less attention on speed. In this paper, we propose a general framework for text detection called Guided CNN to achieve the two goals simultaneously. The proposed model consists of one guidance subnetwork, where a guidance mask is learned from the input image itself, and one primary text detector, where every convolution and non-linear operation are conducted only in the guidance mask. On the one hand, the guidance subnetwork filters out non-text regions coarsely, greatly reduces the computation complexity. On the other hand, the primary text detector focuses on distinguishing between text and hard non-text regions and regressing text bounding boxes, achieves a better detection accuracy. A training strategy, called background-aware block-wise random synthesis, is proposed to further boost up the performance. We demonstrate that the proposed Guided CNN is not only effective but also efficient with two state-of-the-art methods, CTPN and EAST, as backbones. On the challenging benchmark ICDAR 2013, it speeds up CTPN by 2.9 times on average, while improving the F-measure by 1.5%. On ICDAR 2015, it speeds up EAST by 2.0 times while improving the F-measure by 1.0%. 
### 200.Unsupervised Deep Representations for Learning Audience Facial Behaviors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04136.pdf)
> In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning approach for analyzing facial behavior based on a deep generative model combined with a convolutional neural network (CNN). We jointly train a variational auto-encoder (VAE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn a powerful latent representation from footage of audiences viewing feature-length movies. We show that the learned latent representation successfully encodes meaningful signatures of behaviors related to audience engagement (smiling &amp; laughing) and disengagement (yawning). Our results provide a proof of concept for a more general methodology for annotating hard-to-label multimedia data featuring sparse examples of signals of interest. 
### 201.Neural Best-Buddies: Sparse Cross-Domain Correspondence [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04140.pdf)
> Correspondence between images is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with a variety of graphics applications. This paper presents a novel method for sparse cross-domain correspondence. Our method is designed for pairs of images where the main objects of interest may belong to different semantic categories and differ drastically in shape and appearance, yet still contain semantically related or geometrically similar parts. Our approach operates on hierarchies of deep features, extracted from the input images by a pre-trained CNN. Specifically, starting from the coarsest layer in both hierarchies, we search for Neural Best Buddies (NBB): pairs of neurons that are mutual nearest neighbors. The key idea is then to percolate NBBs through the hierarchy, while narrowing down the search regions at each level and retaining only NBBs with significant activations. Furthermore, in order to overcome differences in appearance, each pair of search regions is transformed into a common appearance. We evaluate our method via a user study, in addition to comparisons with alternative correspondence approaches. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated using a variety of graphics applications, including cross-domain image alignment, creation of hybrid images, automatic image morphing, and more. 
### 202.Deep Representation Learning for Domain Adaptation of Semantic Image  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04141.pdf)
> Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have pushed the state-of-the art for semantic segmentation provided that a large amount of images together with pixel-wise annotations is available. Data collection is expensive and a solution to alleviate it is to use transfer learning. This reduces the amount of annotated data required for the network training but it does not get rid of this heavy processing step. We propose a method of transfer learning without annotations on the target task for datasets with redundant content and distinct pixel distributions. Our method takes advantage of the approximate content alignment of the images between two datasets when the approximation error prevents the reuse of annotation from one dataset to another. Given the annotations for only one dataset, we train a first network in a supervised manner. This network autonomously learns to generate deep data representations relevant to the semantic segmentation. Then the images in the new dataset, we train a new network to generate a deep data representation that matches the one from the first network on the previous dataset. The training consists in a regression between feature maps and does not require any annotations on the new dataset. We show that this method reaches performances similar to a classic transfer learning on the PASCAL VOC dataset with synthetic transformations. 
### 203.A Performance Evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks for Face Anti  Spoofing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04176.pdf)
> In the current era, biometric based access control is becoming more popular due to its simplicity and ease to use by the users. It reduces the manual work of identity recognition and facilitates the automatic processing. Face is one of the most important biometric visual information that can be easily captured without user cooperation in uncontrolled environment. Precise detection of spoofed faces should be on the high priority to make face based identity recognition and access control robust against possible attacks. The recently evolved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning technique has been proved as one of the excellent method to deal with the visual information very effectively. The CNN learns the hierarchical features at intermediate layers automatically from the data. Several CNN based methods such as Inception and ResNet have shown outstanding performance for image classification problem. This paper does a performance evaluation of CNNs for face anti-spoofing. The Inception and ResNet CNN architectures are used in this study. The results are computed over benchmark MSU Mobile Face Spoofing Database. The experiments are done by considering the different aspects such as depth of the model, random weight initialization vs weight transfer, fine tuning vs training from scratch and different learning rate. The favorable results are obtained using these CNN architectures for face anti-spoofing in different settings. 
### 204.Retinal Vessel Segmentation Based on Conditional Deep Convolutional  Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04224.pdf)
> The segmentation of retinal vessels is of significance for doctors to diagnose the fundus diseases. However, existing methods have various problems in the segmentation of the retinal vessels, such as insufficient segmentation of retinal vessels, weak anti-noise interference ability, and sensitivity to lesions, etc. Aiming to the shortcomings of existed methods, this paper proposes the use of conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial networks to segment the retinal vessels. We mainly improve the network structure of the generator. The introduction of the residual module at the convolutional layer for residual learning makes the network structure sensitive to changes in the output, as to better adjust the weight of the generator. In order to reduce the number of parameters and calculations, using a small convolution to halve the number of channels in the input signature before using a large convolution kernel. By used skip connection to connect the output of the convolutional layer with the output of the deconvolution layer to avoid low-level information sharing. By verifying the method on the DRIVE and STARE datasets, the segmentation accuracy rate is 96.08% and 97.71%, the sensitivity reaches 82.74% and 85.34% respectively, and the F-measure reaches 82.08% and 85.02% respectively. The sensitivity is 4.82% and 2.4% higher than that of R2U-Net. 
### 205.Just-in-Time Reconstruction: Inpainting Sparse Maps using Single View  Depth Predictors as Priors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04239.pdf)
> We present ``just-in-time reconstruction" as real-time image-guided inpainting of a map with arbitrary scale and sparsity to generate a fully dense depth map for the image. In particular, our goal is to inpaint a sparse map --- obtained from either a monocular visual SLAM system or a sparse sensor --- using a single-view depth prediction network as a virtual depth sensor. We adopt a fairly standard approach to data fusion, to produce a fused depth map by performing inference over a novel fully-connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) which is parameterized by the input depth maps and their pixel-wise confidence weights. Crucially, we obtain the confidence weights that parameterize the CRF model in a data-dependent manner via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are trained to model the conditional depth error distributions given each source of input depth map and the associated RGB image. Our CRF model penalises absolute depth error in its nodes and pairwise scale-invariant depth error in its edges, and the confidence-based fusion minimizes the impact of outlier input depth values on the fused result. We demonstrate the flexibility of our method by real-time inpainting of ORB-SLAM, Kinect, and LIDAR depth maps acquired both indoors and outdoors at arbitrary scale and varied amount of irregular sparsity. 
### 206.Reciprocal Attention Fusion for Visual Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04247.pdf)
> Existing attention mechanisms either attend to local image grid or object level features for Visual Question Answering (VQA). Motivated by the observation that questions can relate to both object instances and their parts, we propose a novel attention mechanism that jointly considers reciprocal relationships between the two levels of visual details. The bottom-up attention thus generated is further coalesced with the top-down information to only focus on the scene elements that are most relevant to a given question. Our design hierarchically fuses multi-modal information i.e., language, object- and gird-level features, through an efficient tensor decomposition scheme. The proposed model improves the state-of-the-art single model performances from 67.9% to 68.2% on VQAv1 and from 65.7% to 67.4% on VQAv2, demonstrating a significant boost. 
### 207.Stingray Detection of Aerial Images Using Augmented Training Images  Generated by A Conditional Generative Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04262.pdf)
> In this paper, we present an object detection method that tackles the stingray detection problem based on aerial images. In this problem, the images are aerially captured on a sea-surface area by using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and the stingrays swimming under (but close to) the sea surface are the target we want to detect and locate. To this end, we use a deep object detection method, faster RCNN, to train a stingray detector based on a limited training set of images. To boost the performance, we develop a new generative approach, conditional GLO, to increase the training samples of stingray, which is an extension of the Generative Latent Optimization (GLO) approach. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that generate new data only for image classification, our proposed method that mixes foreground and background together can generate new data for an object detection task, and thus improve the training efficacy of a CNN detector. Experimental results show that satisfiable performance can be obtained by using our approach on stingray detection in aerial images. 
### 208.Piecewise classifier mappings: Learning fine-grained learners for novel  categories with few examples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04288.pdf)
> Humans are capable of learning a new fine-grained concept with very little supervision, e.g., few exemplary images for a species of bird, yet our best deep learning systems need hundreds or thousands of labeled examples. In this paper, we try to reduce this gap by studying the fine-grained image recognition problem in a challenging few-shot learning setting, termed few-shot fine-grained recognition (FSFG). The task of FSFG requires the learning systems to build classifiers for novel fine-grained categories from few examples (only one or less than five). To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end trainable deep network which is inspired by the state-of-the-art fine-grained recognition model and is tailored for the FSFG task. <br />Specifically, our network consists of a bilinear feature learning module and a classifier mapping module: while the former encodes the discriminative information of an exemplar image into a feature vector, the latter maps the intermediate feature into the decision boundary of the novel category. The key novelty of our model is a "piecewise mappings" function in the classifier mapping module, which generates the decision boundary via learning a set of more attainable sub-classifiers in a more parameter-economic way. We learn the exemplar-to-classifier mapping based on an auxiliary dataset in a meta-learning fashion, which is expected to be able to generalize to novel categories. By conducting comprehensive experiments on three fine-grained datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over the competing baselines. 
### 209.Weakly and Semi Supervised Human Body Part Parsing via Pose-Guided  Knowledge Transfer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04310.pdf)
> Human body part parsing, or human semantic part segmentation, is fundamental to many computer vision tasks. In conventional semantic segmentation methods, the ground truth segmentations are provided, and fully convolutional networks (FCN) are trained in an end-to-end scheme. Although these methods have demonstrated impressive results, their performance highly depends on the quantity and quality of training data. In this paper, we present a novel method to generate synthetic human part segmentation data using easily-obtained human keypoint annotations. Our key idea is to exploit the anatomical similarity among human to transfer the parsing results of a person to another person with similar pose. Using these estimated results as additional training data, our semi-supervised model outperforms its strong-supervised counterpart by 6 mIOU on the PASCAL-Person-Part dataset, and we achieve state-of-the-art human parsing results. Our approach is general and can be readily extended to other object/animal parsing task assuming that their anatomical similarity can be annotated by keypoints. The proposed model and accompanying source code are available at <a href="https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/WSHP">this https URL</a> 
### 210.Exploiting Images for Video Recognition with Hierarchical Generative  Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04384.pdf)
> Existing deep learning methods of video recognition usually require a large number of labeled videos for training. But for a new task, videos are often unlabeled and it is also time-consuming and labor-intensive to annotate them. Instead of human annotation, we try to make use of existing fully labeled images to help recognize those videos. However, due to the problem of domain shifts and heterogeneous feature representations, the performance of classifiers trained on images may be dramatically degraded for video recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Hierarchical Generative Adversarial Networks (HiGAN), to enhance recognition in videos (i.e., target domain) by transferring knowledge from images (i.e., source domain). The HiGAN model consists of a \emph{low-level} conditional GAN and a \emph{high-level} conditional GAN. By taking advantage of these two-level adversarial learning, our method is capable of learning a domain-invariant feature representation of source images and target videos. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging video recognition datasets (i.e. UCF101 and HMDB51) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared with the existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods. 
### 211.Weakly Supervised Domain-Specific Color Naming Based on Attention [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04385.pdf)
> The majority of existing color naming methods focuses on the eleven basic color terms of the English language. However, in many applications, different sets of color names are used for the accurate description of objects. Labeling data to learn these domain-specific color names is an expensive and laborious task. Therefore, in this article we aim to learn color names from weakly labeled data. For this purpose, we add an attention branch to the color naming network. The attention branch is used to modulate the pixel-wise color naming predictions of the network. In experiments, we illustrate that the attention branch correctly identifies the relevant regions. Furthermore, we show that our method obtains state-of-the-art results for pixel-wise and image-wise classification on the EBAY dataset and is able to learn color names for various domains. 
### 212.Iteratively Trained Interactive Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04398.pdf)
> Deep learning requires large amounts of training data to be effective. For the task of object segmentation, manually labeling data is very expensive, and hence interactive methods are needed. Following recent approaches, we develop an interactive object segmentation system which uses user input in the form of clicks as the input to a convolutional network. While previous methods use heuristic click sampling strategies to emulate user clicks during training, we propose a new iterative training strategy. During training, we iteratively add clicks based on the errors of the currently predicted segmentation. We show that our iterative training strategy together with additional improvements to the network architecture results in improved results over the state-of-the-art. 
### 213.PAD-Net: Multi-Tasks Guided Prediction-and-Distillation Network for  Simultaneous Depth Estimation and Scene Parsing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04409.pdf)
> Depth estimation and scene parsing are two particularly important tasks in visual scene understanding. In this paper we tackle the problem of simultaneous depth estimation and scene parsing in a joint CNN. The task can be typically treated as a deep multi-task learning problem [42]. Different from previous methods directly optimizing multiple tasks given the input training data, this paper proposes a novel multi-task guided prediction-and-distillation network (PAD-Net), which first predicts a set of intermediate auxiliary tasks ranging from low level to high level, and then the predictions from these intermediate auxiliary tasks are utilized as multi-modal input via our proposed multi-modal distillation modules for the final tasks. During the joint learning, the intermediate tasks not only act as supervision for learning more robust deep representations but also provide rich multi-modal information for improving the final tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on two challenging datasets (i.e. NYUD-v2 and Cityscapes) for both the depth estimation and scene parsing tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 
### 214.Novel Deep Learning Model for Traffic Sign Detection Using Capsule  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04424.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks are the most widely used deep learning algorithms for traffic signal classification till date but they fail to capture pose, view, orientation of the images because of the intrinsic inability of max pooling layer.This paper proposes a novel method for Traffic sign detection using deep learning architecture called capsule networks that achieves outstanding performance on the German traffic sign dataset.Capsule network consists of capsules which are a group of neurons representing the instantiating parameters of an object like the pose and orientation by using the dynamic routing and route by agreement algorithms.unlike the previous approaches of manual feature extraction,multiple deep neural networks with many parameters,our method eliminates the manual effort and provides resistance to the spatial variances.CNNs can be fooled easily using various adversary attacks and capsule networks can overcome such attacks from the intruders and can offer more reliability in traffic sign detection for autonomous vehicles.Capsule network have achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy of 97.6% on German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset (GTSRB). 
### 215.Augmented Skeleton Space Transfer for Depth-based Hand Pose Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04497.pdf)
> Crucial to the success of training a depth-based 3D hand pose estimator (HPE) is the availability of comprehensive datasets covering diverse camera perspectives, shapes, and pose variations. However, collecting such annotated datasets is challenging. We propose to complete existing databases by generating new database entries. The key idea is to synthesize data in the skeleton space (instead of doing so in the depth-map space) which enables an easy and intuitive way of manipulating data entries. Since the skeleton entries generated in this way do not have the corresponding depth map entries, we exploit them by training a separate hand pose generator (HPG) which synthesizes the depth map from the skeleton entries. By training the HPG and HPE in a single unified optimization framework enforcing that 1) the HPE agrees with the paired depth and skeleton entries; and 2) the HPG-HPE combination satisfies the cyclic consistency (both the input and the output of HPG-HPE are skeletons) observed via the newly generated unpaired skeletons, our algorithm constructs a HPE which is robust to variations that go beyond the coverage of the existing database. Our training algorithm adopts the generative adversarial networks (GAN) training process. As a by-product, we obtain a hand pose discriminator (HPD) that is capable of picking out realistic hand poses. Our algorithm exploits this capability to refine the initial skeleton estimates in testing, further improving the accuracy. We test our algorithm on four challenging benchmark datasets (ICVL, MSRA, NYU and Big Hand 2.2M datasets) and demonstrate that our approach outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively. 
### 216.ContextNet: Exploring Context and Detail for Semantic Segmentation in  Real-time [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04554.pdf)
> Modern deep learning architectures produce highly accurate results on many challenging semantic segmentation datasets. State-of-the-art methods are, however, not directly transferable to real-time applications or embedded devices, since naive adaptation of such systems to reduce computational cost (speed, memory and energy) causes a significant drop in accuracy. We propose ContextNet, a new deep neural network architecture which builds on factorized convolution, network compression and pyramid representation to produce competitive semantic segmentation in real-time with low memory requirement. ContextNet combines a deep network branch at low resolution that captures global context information efficiently with a shallow branch that focuses on high-resolution segmentation details. We analyse our network in a thorough ablation study and present results on the Cityscapes dataset, achieving 66.1% accuracy at 18.3 frames per second at full (1024x2048) resolution (23.2 fps with pipelined computations for streamed data). 
### 217.Classification of Protein Crystallization X-Ray Images Using Major  Convolutional Neural Network Architectures [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04563.pdf)
> The generation of protein crystals is necessary for the study of protein molecular function and structure. This is done empirically by processing large numbers of crystallization trials and inspecting them regularly in search of those with forming crystals. To avoid missing the hard-gained crystals, this visual inspection of the trial X-ray images is done manually as opposed to the existing less accurate machine learning methods. To achieve higher accuracy for automation, we applied some of the most successful convolutional neural networks (ResNet, Inception, VGG, and AlexNet) for 10-way classification of the X-ray images. We showed that substantial classification accuracy is gained by using such networks compared to two simpler ones previously proposed for this purpose. The best accuracy was obtained from ResNet (81.43%), which corresponds to a missed crystal rate of 5.9%. This rate could be lowered to less than 0.1% by using a top-3 classification strategy. Our dataset consisted of 486,000 internally annotated images, which was augmented to more than a million to address class imbalance. We also provide a label-wise analysis of the results, identifying the main sources of error and inaccuracy. 
### 218.Revisiting Dilated Convolution: A Simple Approach for Weakly- and Semi-  Supervised Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04574.pdf)
> Despite the remarkable progress, weakly supervised segmentation approaches are still inferior to their fully supervised counterparts. We obverse the performance gap mainly comes from their limitation on learning to produce high-quality dense object localization maps from image-level supervision. To mitigate such a gap, we revisit the dilated convolution [1] and reveal how it can be utilized in a novel way to effectively overcome this critical limitation of weakly supervised segmentation approaches. Specifically, we find that varying dilation rates can effectively enlarge the receptive fields of convolutional kernels and more importantly transfer the surrounding discriminative information to non-discriminative object regions, promoting the emergence of these regions in the object localization maps. Then, we design a generic classification network equipped with convolutional blocks of different dilated rates. It can produce dense and reliable object localization maps and effectively benefit both weakly- and semi- supervised semantic segmentation. Despite the apparent simplicity, our proposed approach obtains superior performance over state-of-the-arts. In particular, it achieves 60.8% and 67.6% mIoU scores on Pascal VOC 2012 test set in weakly- (only image-level labels are available) and semi- (1,464 segmentation masks are available) supervised settings, which are the new state-of-the-arts. 
### 219.The Domain Transform Solver [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04590.pdf)
> We present a framework for edge-aware optimization that is an order of magnitude faster than the state of the art while having comparable performance. Our key insight is that the optimization can be formulated by leveraging properties of the domain transform, a method for edge-aware filtering that defines a distance-preserving 1D mapping of the input space. This enables our method to improve performance for a variety of problems including stereo, depth super-resolution, and render from defocus, while keeping the computational complexity linear in the number of pixels. Our method is highly parallelizable and adaptable, and it has demonstrable scalability with respect to image resolution. 
### 220.Joint Flow: Temporal Flow Fields for Multi Person Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04596.pdf)
> In this work we propose an online multi person pose tracking approach which works on two consecutive frames $I_{t-1}$ and $I_t$. The general formulation of our temporal network allows to rely on any multi person pose estimation approach as spatial network. From the spatial network we extract image features and pose features for both frames. These features serve as input for our temporal model that predicts Temporal Flow Fields (TFF). These TFF are vector fields which indicate the direction in which each body joint is going to move from frame $I_{t-1}$ to frame $I_t$. This novel representation allows to formulate a similarity measure of detected joints. These similarities are used as binary potentials in a bipartite graph optimization problem in order to perform tracking of multiple poses. We show that these TFF can be learned by a relative small CNN network whilst achieving state-of-the-art multi person pose tracking results. 
### 221.Unsupervised Learning for Fast Probabilistic Diffeomorphic Registration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04605.pdf)
> Traditional deformable registration techniques achieve impressive results and offer a rigorous theoretical treatment, but are computationally intensive since they solve an optimization problem for each image pair. Recently, learning-based methods have facilitated fast registration by learning spatial deformation functions. However, these approaches use restricted deformation models, require supervised labels, or do not guarantee a diffeomorphic (topology-preserving) registration. Furthermore, learning-based registration tools have not been derived from a probabilistic framework that can offer uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we present a probabilistic generative model and derive an unsupervised learning-based inference algorithm that makes use of recent developments in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We demonstrate our method on a 3D brain registration task, and provide an empirical analysis of the algorithm. Our approach results in state of the art accuracy and very fast runtimes, while providing diffeomorphic guarantees and uncertainty estimates. Our implementation is available online at <a href="https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph">this https URL</a> . 
### 222.Constrained-CNN losses forweakly supervised segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04628.pdf)
> Weak supervision, e.g., in the form of partial labels or image tags, is currently attracting significant attention in CNN segmentation as it can mitigate the lack of full and laborious pixel/voxel annotations. Enforcing high-order (global) inequality constraints on the network output, for instance, on the size of the target region, can leverage unlabeled data, guiding training with domain-specific knowledge. Inequality constraints are very flexible because they do not assume exact prior knowledge. However,constrained Lagrangian dual optimization has been largely avoided in deep networks, mainly for computational tractability reasons.To the best of our knowledge, the method of Pathak et al. is the only prior work that addresses deep CNNs with linear constraints in weakly supervised segmentation. It uses the constraints to synthesize fully-labeled training masks (proposals)from weak labels, mimicking full supervision and facilitating dual optimization.We propose to introduce a differentiable term, which enforces inequality constraints directly in the loss function, avoiding expensive Lagrangian dual iterates and proposal generation. From constrained-optimization perspective, our simple approach is not optimal as there is no guarantee that the constraints are satisfied. However, surprisingly,it yields substantially better results than the proposal-based constrained CNNs, while reducing the computational demand for training.In the context of cardiac images, we reached a segmentation performance close to full supervision using a fraction (0.1%) of the full ground-truth labels and image-level tags.While our experiments focused on basic linear constraints such as the target-region size and image tags, our framework can be easily extended to other non-linear constraints.Therefore, it has the potential to close the gap between weakly and fully supervised learning in semantic image segmentation. 
### 223.Direction-aware Spatial Context Features for Shadow Detection and  Removal [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04635.pdf)
> Shadow detection and shadow removal are fundamental and challenging tasks, requiring an understanding of the global image semantics. This paper presents a novel deep neural network design for shadow detection and removal by analyzing the image context in a direction-aware manner. To achieve this, we first formulate the direction-aware attention mechanism in a spatial recurrent neural network (RNN) by introducing attention weights when aggregating spatial context features in the RNN. By learning these weights through training, we can recover direction-aware spatial context (DSC) for detecting and removing shadows. This design is developed into the DSC module and embedded in a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the DSC features in different levels. Moreover, we design a weighted cross entropy loss to make effective the training for shadow detection and further adopt the network for shadow removal by using a Euclidean loss function and formulating a color transfer function to address the color and luminosity inconsistency in the training pairs. We employ two shadow detection benchmark datasets and two shadow removal benchmark datasets, and perform various experiments to evaluate our method. Experimental results show that our method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both shadow detection and shadow removal. 
### 224.I Have Seen Enough: A Teacher Student Network for Video Classification  Using Fewer Frames [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04668.pdf)
> Over the past few years, various tasks involving videos such as classification, description, summarization and question answering have received a lot of attention. Current models for these tasks compute an encoding of the video by treating it as a sequence of images and going over every image in the sequence. However, for longer videos this is very time consuming. In this paper, we focus on the task of video classification and aim to reduce the computational time by using the idea of distillation. Specifically, we first train a teacher network which looks at all the frames in a video and computes a representation for the video. We then train a student network whose objective is to process only a small fraction of the frames in the video and still produce a representation which is very close to the representation computed by the teacher network. This smaller student network involving fewer computations can then be employed at inference time for video classification. We experiment with the YouTube-8M dataset and show that the proposed student network can reduce the inference time by upto 30% with a very small drop in the performance 
### 225.BDD100K: A Diverse Driving Video Database with Scalable Annotation  Tooling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04687.pdf)
> Datasets drive vision progress and autonomous driving is a critical vision application, yet existing driving datasets are impoverished in terms of visual content. Driving imagery is becoming plentiful, but annotation is slow and expensive, as annotation tools have not kept pace with the flood of data. Our first contribution is the design and implementation of a scalable annotation system that can provide a comprehensive set of image labels for large-scale driving datasets. Our second contribution is a new driving dataset, facilitated by our tooling, which is an order of magnitude larger than previous efforts, and is comprised of over 100K videos with diverse kinds of annotations including image level tagging, object bounding boxes, drivable areas, lane markings, and full-frame instance segmentation. The dataset possesses geographic, environmental, and weather diversity, which is useful for training models so that they are less likely to be surprised by new conditions.

### 226.Exploring object-centric and scene-centric CNN features and their  complementarity for human rights violations recognition in images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04714.pdf)
> Identifying potential abuses of human rights through imagery is a novel and challenging task in the field of computer vision, that will enable to expose human rights violations over large-scale data that may otherwise be impossible. While standard databases for object and scene categorisation contain hundreds of different classes, the largest available dataset of human rights violations contains only 4 classes. Here, we introduce the `Human Rights Archive Database' (HRA), a verified-by-experts repository of 3050 human rights violations photographs, labelled with human rights semantic categories, comprising a list of the types of human rights abuses encountered at present. With the HRA dataset and a two-phase transfer learning scheme, we fine-tuned the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to provide human rights violations classification CNNs (HRA-CNNs). We also present extensive experiments refined to evaluate how well object-centric and scene-centric CNN features can be combined for the task of recognising human rights abuses. With this, we show that HRA database poses a challenge at a higher level for the well studied representation learning methods, and provide a benchmark in the task of human rights violations recognition in visual context. We expect this dataset can help to open up new horizons on creating systems able of recognising rich information about human rights violations. Our dataset, codes and trained models are available online at <a href="https://github.com/GKalliatakis/Human-Rights-Archive-CNNs.">this https URL</a> 
### 227.Learning to Find Eye Region Landmarks for Remote Gaze Estimation in  Unconstrained Settings [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04771.pdf)
> Conventional feature-based and model-based gaze estimation methods have proven to perform well in settings with controlled illumination and specialized cameras. In unconstrained real-world settings, however, such methods are surpassed by recent appearance-based methods due to difficulties in modeling factors such as illumination changes and other visual artifacts. We present a novel learning-based method for eye region landmark localization that enables conventional methods to be competitive to latest appearance-based methods. Despite having been trained exclusively on synthetic data, our method exceeds the state of the art for iris localization and eye shape registration on real-world imagery. We then use the detected landmarks as input to iterative model-fitting and lightweight learning-based gaze estimation methods. Our approach outperforms existing model-fitting and appearance-based methods in the context of person-independent and personalized gaze estimation. 
### 228.Convolutional CRFs for Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04777.pdf)
> For the challenging semantic image segmentation task the most efficient models have traditionally combined the structured modelling capabilities of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with the feature extraction power of CNNs. In more recent works however, CRF post-processing has fallen out of favour. We argue that this is mainly due to the slow training and inference speeds of CRFs, as well as the difficulty of learning the internal CRF parameters. To overcome both issues we propose to add the assumption of conditional independence to the framework of fully-connected CRFs. This allows us to reformulate the inference in terms of convolutions, which can be implemented highly efficiently on GPUs. Doing so speeds up inference and training by a factor of more then 100. All parameters of the convolutional CRFs can easily be optimized using backpropagation. To facilitating further CRF research we make our implementation publicly available.

### 229.Enhanced Signal Recovery via Sparsity Inducing Image Priors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04828.pdf)
> Parsimony in signal representation is a topic of active research. Sparse signal processing and representation is the outcome of this line of research which has many applications in information processing and has shown significant improvement in real-world applications such as recovery, classification, clustering, super resolution, etc. This vast influence of sparse signal processing in real-world problems raises a significant need in developing novel sparse signal representation algorithms to obtain more robust systems. In such algorithms, a few open challenges remain in (a) efficiently posing sparsity on signals that can capture the structure of underlying signal and (b) the design of tractable algorithms that can recover signals under aforementioned sparse models. 
### 230.Covariance Pooling For Facial Expression Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04855.pdf)
> Classifying facial expressions into different categories requires capturing regional distortions of facial landmarks. We believe that second-order statistics such as covariance is better able to capture such distortions in regional facial fea- tures. In this work, we explore the benefits of using a man- ifold network structure for covariance pooling to improve facial expression recognition. In particular, we first employ such kind of manifold networks in conjunction with tradi- tional convolutional networks for spatial pooling within in- dividual image feature maps in an end-to-end deep learning manner. By doing so, we are able to achieve a recognition accuracy of 58.14% on the validation set of Static Facial Expressions in the Wild (SFEW 2.0) and 87.0% on the vali- dation set of Real-World Affective Faces (RAF) Database. Both of these results are the best results we are aware of. Besides, we leverage covariance pooling to capture the tem- poral evolution of per-frame features for video-based facial expression recognition. Our reported results demonstrate the advantage of pooling image-set features temporally by stacking the designed manifold network of covariance pool-ing on top of convolutional network layers. 
### 231.LMNet: Real-time Multiclass Object Detection on CPU using 3D LiDAR [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04902.pdf)
> This paper describes an optimized single-stage deep convolutional neural network to detect objects in urban environments, using nothing more than point cloud data. This feature enables our method to work regardless the time of the day and the lighting conditions.The proposed network structure employs dilated convolutions to gradually increase the perceptive field as depth increases, this helps to reduce the computation time by about 30%. The network input consists of five perspective representations of the unorganized point cloud data. The network outputs an objectness map and the bounding box offset values for each point. Our experiments showed that using reflection, range, and the position on each of the three axes helped to improve the location and orientation of the output bounding box. We carried out quantitative evaluations with the help of the KITTI dataset evaluation server. It achieved the fastest processing speed among the other contenders, making it suitable for real-time applications. We implemented and tested it on a real vehicle with a Velodyne HDL-64 mounted on top of it. We achieved execution times as fast as 50 FPS using desktop GPUs, and up to 10 FPS on a single Intel Core i5 CPU. The deploy implementation is open-sourced and it can be found as a feature branch inside the autonomous driving framework Autoware. Code is available at: <a href="https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/tree/feature/cnn_lidar_detection">this https URL</a> 
### 232.A Tempt to Unify Heterogeneous Driving Databases using Traffic  Primitives [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04925.pdf)
> A multitude of publicly-available driving datasets and data platforms have been raised for autonomous vehicles (AV). However, the heterogeneities of databases in size, structure and driving context make existing datasets practically ineffective due to a lack of uniform frameworks and searchable indexes. In order to overcome these limitations on existing public datasets, this paper proposes a data unification framework based on traffic primitives with ability to automatically unify and label heterogeneous traffic data. This is achieved by two steps: 1) Carefully arrange raw multidimensional time series driving data into a relational database and then 2) automatically extract labeled and indexed traffic primitives from traffic data through a Bayesian nonparametric learning method. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our developed framework using the collected real vehicle data. 
### 233.DeLS-3D: Deep Localization and Segmentation with a 3D Semantic Map [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04949.pdf)
> For applications such as autonomous driving, self-localization/camera pose estimation and scene parsing are crucial technologies. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to tackle these two problems simultaneously. The uniqueness of our design is a sensor fusion scheme which integrates camera videos, motion sensors (GPS/IMU), and a 3D semantic map in order to achieve robustness and efficiency of the system. Specifically, we first have an initial coarse camera pose obtained from consumer-grade GPS/IMU, based on which a label map can be rendered from the 3D semantic map. Then, the rendered label map and the RGB image are jointly fed into a pose CNN, yielding a corrected camera pose. In addition, to incorporate temporal information, a multi-layer recurrent neural network (RNN) is further deployed improve the pose accuracy. Finally, based on the pose from RNN, we render a new label map, which is fed together with the RGB image into a segment CNN which produces per-pixel semantic label. In order to validate our approach, we build a dataset with registered 3D point clouds and video camera images. Both the point clouds and the images are semantically-labeled. Each video frame has ground truth pose from highly accurate motion sensors. We show that practically, pose estimation solely relying on images like PoseNet may fail due to street view confusion, and it is important to fuse multiple sensors. Finally, various ablation studies are performed, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. In particular, we show that scene parsing and pose estimation are mutually beneficial to achieve a more robust and accurate system. 
### 234.Learning Rich Features for Image Manipulation Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04953.pdf)
> Image manipulation detection is different from traditional semantic object detection because it pays more attention to tampering artifacts than to image content, which suggests that richer features need to be learned. We propose a two-stream Faster R-CNN network and train it endto- end to detect the tampered regions given a manipulated image. One of the two streams is an RGB stream whose purpose is to extract features from the RGB image input to find tampering artifacts like strong contrast difference, unnatural tampered boundaries, and so on. The other is a noise stream that leverages the noise features extracted from a steganalysis rich model filter layer to discover the noise inconsistency between authentic and tampered regions. We then fuse features from the two streams through a bilinear pooling layer to further incorporate spatial co-occurrence of these two modalities. Experiments on four standard image manipulation datasets demonstrate that our two-stream framework outperforms each individual stream, and also achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to alternative methods with robustness to resizing and compression. 
### 235.Learning Temporal Strategic Relationships using Generative Adversarial  Imitation Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04969.pdf)
> This paper presents a novel framework for automatic learning of complex strategies in human decision making. The task that we are interested in is to better facilitate long term planning for complex, multi-step events. We observe temporal relationships at the subtask level of expert demonstrations, and determine the different strategies employed in order to successfully complete a task. To capture the relationship between the subtasks and the overall goal, we utilise two external memory modules, one for capturing dependencies within a single expert demonstration, such as the sequential relationship among different sub tasks, and a global memory module for modelling task level characteristics such as best practice employed by different humans based on their domain expertise. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the hidden state representation of the memory can be used as a reward signal to smooth the state transitions, eradicating subtle changes. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model for an autonomous highway driving application, where we demonstrate its capability to learn different expert policies and outperform state-of-the-art methods. The scope in industrial applications extends to any robotics and automation application which requires learning from complex demonstrations containing series of subtasks. 
### 236.Unifying and Merging Well-trained Deep Neural Networks for Inference  Stage [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04980.pdf)
> We propose a novel method to merge convolutional neural-nets for the inference stage. Given two well-trained networks that may have different architectures that handle different tasks, our method aligns the layers of the original networks and merges them into a unified model by sharing the representative codes of weights. The shared weights are further re-trained to fine-tune the performance of the merged model. The proposed method effectively produces a compact model that may run original tasks simultaneously on resource-limited devices. As it preserves the general architectures and leverages the co-used weights of well-trained networks, a substantial training overhead can be reduced to shorten the system development time. Experimental results demonstrate a satisfactory performance and validate the effectiveness of the method. 
### 237.Deep Decision Trees for Discriminative Dictionary Learning with  Adversarial Multi-Agent Trajectories [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05009.pdf)
> With the explosion in the availability of spatio-temporal tracking data in modern sports, there is an enormous opportunity to better analyse, learn and predict important events in adversarial group environments. In this paper, we propose a deep decision tree architecture for discriminative dictionary learning from adversarial multi-agent trajectories. We first build up a hierarchy for the tree structure by adding each layer and performing feature weight based clustering in the forward pass. We then fine tune the player role weights using back propagation. The hierarchical architecture ensures the interpretability and the integrity of the group representation. The resulting architecture is a decision tree, with leaf-nodes capturing a dictionary of multi-agent group interactions. Due to the ample volume of data available, we focus on soccer tracking data, although our approach can be used in any adversarial multi-agent domain. We present applications of proposed method for simulating soccer games as well as evaluating and quantifying team strategies. 
### 238.Learning Dual Convolutional Neural Networks for Low-Level Vision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05020.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a general dual convolutional neural network (DualCNN) for low-level vision problems, e.g., super-resolution, edge-preserving filtering, deraining and dehazing. These problems usually involve the estimation of two components of the target signals: structures and details. Motivated by this, our proposed DualCNN consists of two parallel branches, which respectively recovers the structures and details in an end-to-end manner. The recovered structures and details can generate the target signals according to the formation model for each particular application. The DualCNN is a flexible framework for low-level vision tasks and can be easily incorporated into existing CNNs. Experimental results show that the DualCNN can be effectively applied to numerous low-level vision tasks with favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 239.Multi-view Common Component Discriminant Analysis for Cross-view  Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05029.pdf)
> Cross-view classification that means to classify samples from heterogeneous views is a significant yet challenging problem in computer vision. A promising approach to handle this problem is the multi-view subspace learning (MvSL), which intends to find a common subspace for multi-view data. Despite the satisfactory results achieved by existing methods, the performance of previous work will be dramatically degraded when multi-view data lies on nonlinear manifolds. To circumvent this drawback, we propose Multi-view Common Component Discriminant Analysis (MvCCDA) to handle view discrepancy, discriminability and nonlinearity in a joint manner. Specifically, our MvCCDA incorporates supervised information and local geometric information into the common component extraction process to learn a discriminant common subspace and to discover the nonlinear structure embedded in multi-view data. We develop a kernel method of MvCCDA to further boost the performance of MvCCDA. Beyond kernel extension, optimization and complexity analysis of MvCCDA are also presented for completeness. Our MvCCDA is competitive with the state-of-the-art MvSL based methods on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority. 
### 240.Unsupervised Intuitive Physics from Visual Observations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05086.pdf)
> While learning models of intuitive physics is an increasingly active area of research, current approaches still fall short of natural intelligences in one important regard: they require external supervision, such as explicit access to physical states, at training and sometimes even at test times. Some authors have relaxed such requirements by supplementing the model with an handcrafted physical simulator. Still, the resulting methods are unable to automatically learn new complex environments and to understand physical interactions within them. In this work, we demonstrated for the first time learning such predictors directly from raw visual observations and without relying on simulators. We do so in two steps: first, we learn to track mechanically-salient objects in videos using causality and equivariance, two unsupervised learning principles that do not require auto-encoding. Second, we demonstrate that the extracted positions are sufficient to successfully train visual motion predictors that can take the underlying environment into account. We validate our predictors on synthetic datasets; then, we introduce a new dataset, ROLL4REAL, consisting of real objects rolling on complex terrains (pool table, elliptical bowl, and random height-field). We show that in all such cases it is possible to learn reliable extrapolators of the object trajectories from raw videos alone, without any form of external supervision and with no more prior knowledge than the choice of a convolutional neural network architecture. 
### 241.Exploiting the Value of the Center-dark Channel Prior for Salient Object  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05132.pdf)
> Saliency detection aims to detect the most attractive objects in images and is widely used as a foundation for various applications. In this paper, we propose a novel salient object detection algorithm for RGB-D images using center-dark channel priors. First, we generate an initial saliency map based on a color saliency map and a depth saliency map of a given RGB-D image. Then, we generate a center-dark channel map based on center saliency and dark channel priors. Finally, we fuse the initial saliency map with the center dark channel map to generate the final saliency map. Extensive evaluations over four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against most of the state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, we further discuss the application of the proposed algorithm in small target detection and demonstrate the universal value of center-dark channel priors in the field of object detection. 
### 242.The Effects of Image Pre- and Post-Processing, Wavelet Decomposition,  and Local Binary Patterns on U-Nets for Skin Lesion Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05239.pdf)
> Skin cancer is a widespread, global, and potentially deadly disease, which over the last three decades has afflicted more lives in the USA than all other forms of cancer combined. There have been a lot of promising recent works utilizing deep network architectures, such as FCNs, U-Nets, and ResNets, for developing automated skin lesion segmentation. This paper investigates various pre- and post-processing techniques for improving the performance of U-Nets as measured by the Jaccard Index. The dataset provided as part of the "2017 ISBI Challenges on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection" was used for this evaluation and the performance of the finalist competitors was the standard for comparison. The pre-processing techniques employed in the proposed system included contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and vignette correction. More advanced image transformations, such as local binary patterns and wavelet decomposition, were also employed to augment the raw grayscale images used as network input features. While the performance of the proposed system fell short of the winners of the challenge, it was determined that using wavelet decomposition as an early transformation step improved the overall performance of the system over pre- and post-processing steps alone. 
### 243.Normal Similarity Network for Generative Modelling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05269.pdf)
> Gaussian distributions are commonly used as a key building block in many generative models. However, their applicability has not been well explored in deep networks. In this paper, we propose a novel deep generative model named as Normal Similarity Network (NSN) where the layers are constructed with Gaussian-style filters. NSN is trained with a layer-wise non-parametric density estimation algorithm that iteratively down-samples the training images and captures the density of the down-sampled training images in the final layer. Additionally, we propose NSN-Gen for generating new samples from noise vectors by iteratively reconstructing feature maps in the hidden layers of NSN. Our experiments suggest encouraging results of the proposed model for a wide range of computer vision applications including image generation, styling and reconstruction from occluded images. 
### 244.Cycle-Dehaze: Enhanced CycleGAN for Single Image Dehazing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05308.pdf)
> In this paper, we present an end-to-end network, called Cycle-Dehaze, for single image dehazing problem, which does not require pairs of hazy and corresponding ground truth images for training. That is, we train the network by feeding clean and hazy images in an unpaired manner. Moreover, the proposed approach does not rely on estimation of the atmospheric scattering model parameters. Our method enhances CycleGAN formulation by combining cycle-consistency and perceptual losses in order to improve the quality of textural information recovery and generate visually better haze-free images. Typically, deep learning models for dehazing take low resolution images as input and produce low resolution outputs. However, in the NTIRE 2018 challenge on single image dehazing, high resolution images were provided. Therefore, we apply bicubic downscaling. After obtaining low-resolution outputs from the network, we utilize the Laplacian pyramid to upscale the output images to the original resolution. We conduct experiments on NYU-Depth, I-HAZE, and O-HAZE datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach improves CycleGAN method both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
### 245.DeepEM: Deep 3D ConvNets With EM For Weakly Supervised Pulmonary Nodule  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05373.pdf)
> Recently deep learning has been witnessing widespread adoption in various medical image applications. However, training complex deep neural nets requires large-scale datasets labeled with ground truth, which are often unavailable in many medical image domains. For instance, to train a deep neural net to detect pulmonary nodules in lung computed tomography (CT) images, current practice is to manually label nodule locations and sizes in many CT images to construct a sufficiently large training dataset, which is costly and difficult to scale. On the other hand, electronic medical records (EMR) contain plenty of partial information on the content of each medical image. In this work, we explore how to tap this vast, but currently unexplored data source to improve pulmonary nodule detection. We propose DeepEM, a novel deep 3D ConvNet framework augmented with expectation-maximization (EM), to mine weakly supervised labels in EMRs for pulmonary nodule detection. Experimental results show that DeepEM can lead to 1.5\% and 3.9\% average improvement in free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) scores on LUNA16 and Tianchi datasets, respectively, demonstrating the utility of incomplete information in EMRs for improving deep learning algorithms.\footnote{<a href="https://github.com/uci-cbcl/DeepEM-for-Weakly-Supervised-Detection.git">this https URL</a>} 
### 246.Deep Attentional Structured Representation Learning for Visual  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05389.pdf)
> Structured representations, such as Bags of Words, VLAD and Fisher Vectors, have proven highly effective to tackle complex visual recognition tasks. As such, they have recently been incorporated into deep architectures. However, while effective, the resulting deep structured representation learning strategies typically aggregate local features from the entire image, ignoring the fact that, in complex recognition tasks, some regions provide much more discriminative information than others. <br />In this paper, we introduce an attentional structured representation learning framework that incorporates an image-specific attention mechanism within the aggregation process. Our framework learns to predict jointly the image class label and an attention map in an end-to-end fashion and without any other supervision than the target label. As evidenced by our experiments, this consistently outperforms attention-less structured representation learning and yields state-of-the-art results on standard scene recognition and fine-grained categorization benchmarks. 
### 247.An Automatic Patch-based Approach for HER-2 Scoring in  Immunohistochemical Breast Cancer Images Using Color Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05392.pdf)
> Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women world-wide, approximately 20-25% of BCs are HER-2 positive. Analysis of HER-2 is fundamental to defining the appropriate therapy for patients with breast cancer. Inter-pathologist variability in the test results can affect diagnostic accuracy. The present study intends to propose an automatic scoring HER-2 algorithm. Based on color features, the technique is fully-automated and avoids segmentation, showing a concordance higher than 90% with a pathologist in the experiments realized. 
### 248.Energy Efficient Hadamard Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05421.pdf)
> Deep learning has made significant improvements at many image processing tasks in recent years, such as image classification, object recognition and object detection. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), which is a popular deep learning architecture designed to process data in multiple array form, show great success to almost all detection \&amp; recognition problems and computer vision tasks. However, the number of parameters in a CNN is too high such that the computers require more energy and larger memory size. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel energy efficient model Binary Weight and Hadamard-transformed Image Network (BWHIN), which is a combination of Binary Weight Network (BWN) and Hadamard-transformed Image Network (HIN). It is observed that energy efficiency is achieved with a slight sacrifice at classification accuracy. Among all energy efficient networks, our novel ensemble model outperforms other energy efficient models. 
### 249.A CNN for homogneous Riemannian manifolds with applications to  Neuroimaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05487.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks are ubiquitous in Machine Learning applications for solving a variety of problems. They however can not be used in their native form when the domain of the data is commonly encountered manifolds such as the sphere, the special orthogonal group, the Grassmanian, the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices and others. Most recently, generalization of CNNs to data domains such as the 2-sphere has been reported by some research groups, which is referred to as the spherical CNNs (SCNNs). The key property of SCNNs distinct from CNNs is that they exhibit the rotational equivariance property that allows for sharing learned weights within a layer. In this paper, we theoretically generalize the CNNs to Riemannian homogeneous manifolds, that include but are not limited to the aforementioned example manifolds. Our key contributions in this work are: (i) A theorem stating that linear group equivariance systems are fully characterized by correlation of functions on the domain manifold and vice-versa. This is fundamental to the characterization of all linear group equivariant systems and parallels the widely used result in linear system theory for vector spaces. (ii) As a corrolary, we prove the equivariance of the correlation operation to group actions admitted by the input domains which are Riemannian homogeneous manifolds. (iii) We present the first end-to-end deep network architecture for classification of diffusion magnetic resonance image (dMRI) scans acquired from a cohort of 44 Parkinson Disease patients and 50 control/normal subjects. (iv) A proof of concept experiment involving synthetic data generated on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices is presented to demonstrate the applicability of our network to other types of domains. 
### 250.Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction of Surrounding Vehicles with Maneuver  based LSTMs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05499.pdf)
> To safely and efficiently navigate through complex traffic scenarios, autonomous vehicles need to have the ability to predict the future motion of surrounding vehicles. Multiple interacting agents, the multi-modal nature of driver behavior, and the inherent uncertainty involved in the task make motion prediction of surrounding vehicles a challenging problem. In this paper, we present an LSTM model for interaction aware motion prediction of surrounding vehicles on freeways. Our model assigns confidence values to maneuvers being performed by vehicles and outputs a multi-modal distribution over future motion based on them. We compare our approach with the prior art for vehicle motion prediction on the publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 datasets. Our results show an improvement in terms of RMS values of prediction error. We also present an ablative analysis of the components of our proposed model and analyze the predictions made by the model in complex traffic scenarios. 
### 251.Learning to Deblur Images with Exemplars [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05503.pdf)
> Human faces are one interesting object class with numerous applications. While significant progress has been made in the generic deblurring problem, existing methods are less effective for blurry face images. The success of the state-of-the-art image deblurring algorithms stems mainly from implicit or explicit restoration of salient edges for kernel estimation. However, existing methods are less effective as only few edges can be restored from blurry face images for kernel estimation. In this paper, we address the problem of deblurring face images by exploiting facial structures. We propose a deblurring algorithm based on an exemplar dataset without using coarse-to-fine strategies or heuristic edge selections. In addition, we develop a convolutional neural network to restore sharp edges from blurry images for deblurring. Extensive experiments against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for deblurring face images. In addition, we show the proposed algorithms can be applied to image deblurring for other object classes. 
### 252.Online Deep Metric Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05510.pdf)
> Metric learning learns a metric function from training data to calculate the similarity or distance between samples. From the perspective of feature learning, metric learning essentially learns a new feature space by feature transformation (e.g., Mahalanobis distance metric). However, traditional metric learning algorithms are shallow, which just learn one metric space (feature transformation). Can we further learn a better metric space from the learnt metric space? In other words, can we learn metric progressively and nonlinearly like deep learning by just using the existing metric learning algorithms? To this end, we present a hierarchical metric learning scheme and implement an online deep metric learning framework, namely ODML. Specifically, we take one online metric learning algorithm as a metric layer, followed by a nonlinear layer (i.e., ReLU), and then stack these layers modelled after the deep learning. The proposed ODML enjoys some nice properties, indeed can learn metric progressively and performs superiorly on some datasets. Various experiments with different settings have been conducted to verify these properties of the proposed ODML. 
### 253.Knowledge Distillation in Generations: More Tolerant Teachers Educate  Better Students [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05551.pdf)
> We focus on the problem of training a deep neural network in generations. The flowchart is that, in order to optimize the target network (student), another network (teacher) with the same architecture is first trained, and used to provide part of supervision signals in the next stage. While this strategy leads to a higher accuracy, many aspects (e.g., why teacher-student optimization helps) still need further explorations. <br />This paper studies this problem from a perspective of controlling the strictness in training the teacher network. Existing approaches mostly used a hard distribution (e.g., one-hot vectors) in training, leading to a strict teacher which itself has a high accuracy, but we argue that the teacher needs to be more tolerant, although this often implies a lower accuracy. The implementation is very easy, with merely an extra loss term added to the teacher network, facilitating a few secondary classes to emerge and complement to the primary class. Consequently, the teacher provides a milder supervision signal (a less peaked distribution), and makes it possible for the student to learn from inter-class similarity and potentially lower the risk of over-fitting. Experiments are performed on standard image classification tasks (CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2012). Although the teacher network behaves less powerful, the students show a persistent ability growth and eventually achieve higher classification accuracies than other competitors. Model ensemble and transfer feature extraction also verify the effectiveness of our approach. 
### 254.On Learning Associations of Faces and Voices [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05553.pdf)
> In this paper, we study the associations between human faces and voices. Audiovisual integration, specifically the integration of facial and vocal information is a well-researched area in neuroscience. It is shown that the overlapping information between the two modalities plays a significant role in perceptual tasks such as speaker identification. Through an online study on a new dataset we created, we confirm previous findings that people can associate unseen faces with corresponding voices and vice versa with greater than chance accuracy. We computationally model the overlapping information between faces and voices and show that the learned cross-modal representation contains enough information to identify matching faces and voices with performance similar to that of humans. Our representation exhibits correlations to certain demographic attributes and features obtained from either visual or aural modality alone. We release our dataset of audiovisual recordings and demographic annotations of people reading out short text used in our studies. 
### 255.Facial Landmark Detection: a Literature Survey [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05563.pdf)
> The locations of the fiducial facial landmark points around facial components and facial contour capture the rigid and non-rigid facial deformations due to head movements and facial expressions. They are hence important for various facial analysis tasks. Many facial landmark detection algorithms have been developed to automatically detect those key points over the years, and in this paper, we perform an extensive review of them. We classify the facial landmark detection algorithms into three major categories: holistic methods, Constrained Local Model (CLM) methods, and the regression-based methods. They differ in the ways to utilize the facial appearance and shape information. The holistic methods explicitly build models to represent the global facial appearance and shape information. The CLMs explicitly leverage the global shape model but build the local appearance models. The regression-based methods implicitly capture facial shape and appearance information. For algorithms within each category, we discuss their underlying theories as well as their differences. We also compare their performances on both controlled and in the wild benchmark datasets, under varying facial expressions, head poses, and occlusion. Based on the evaluations, we point out their respective strengths and weaknesses. There is also a separate section to review the latest deep learning-based algorithms. <br />The survey also includes a listing of the benchmark databases and existing software. Finally, we identify future research directions, including combining methods in different categories to leverage their respective strengths to solve landmark detection "in-the-wild". 
### 256.Cross-connected Networks for Multi-task Learning of Detection and  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05569.pdf)
> Multi-task learning improves generalization performance by sharing knowledge among related tasks. Existing models are for task combinations annotated on the same dataset, while there are cases where multiple datasets are available for each task. How to utilize knowledge of successful single-task CNNs that are trained on each dataset has been explored less than multi-task learning with a single dataset. We propose a cross-connected CNN, a new architecture that connects single-task CNNs through convolutional layers, which transfer useful information for the counterpart. We evaluated our proposed architecture on a combination of detection and segmentation using two datasets. Experiments on pedestrians show our CNN achieved a higher detection performance compared to baseline CNNs, while maintaining high quality for segmentation. It is the first known attempt to tackle multi-task learning with different training datasets between detection and segmentation. Experiments with wild birds demonstrate how our CNN learns general representations from limited datasets. 
### 257.Image Co-segmentation via Multi-scale Local Shape Transfer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05610.pdf)
> Image co-segmentation is a challenging task in computer vision that aims to segment all pixels of the objects from a predefined semantic category. In real-world cases, however, common foreground objects often vary greatly in appearance, making their global shapes highly inconsistent across images and difficult to be segmented. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel co-segmentation approach that transfers patch-level local object shapes which appear more consistent across different images. In our framework, a multi-scale patch neighbourhood system is first generated using proposal flow on arbitrary image-pair, which is further refined by Locally Linear Embedding. Based on the patch relationships, we propose an efficient algorithm to jointly segment the objects in each image while transferring their local shapes across different images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can robustly and effectively segment common objects from an image set. On iCoseg, MSRC and Coseg-Rep dataset, the proposed approach performs comparable or better than the state-of-thearts, while on a more challenging benchmark Fashionista dataset, our method achieves significant improvements. 
### 258.Robust Facial Landmark Localization Based on Texture and Pose Correlated  Initialization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05612.pdf)
> Robust facial landmark localization remains a challenging task when faces are partially occluded. Recently, the cascaded pose regression has attracted increasing attentions, due to it's superior performance in facial landmark localization and occlusion detection. However, such an approach is sensitive to initialization, where an improper initialization can severly degrade the performance. In this paper, we propose a Robust Initialization for Cascaded Pose Regression (RICPR) by providing texture and pose correlated initial shapes for the testing face. By examining the correlation of local binary patterns histograms between the testing face and the training faces, the shapes of the training faces that are most correlated with the testing face are selected as the texture correlated initialization. To make the initialization more robust to various poses, we estimate the rough pose of the testing face according to five fiducial landmarks located by multitask cascaded convolutional networks. Then the pose correlated initial shapes are constructed by the mean face's shape and the rough testing face pose. Finally, the texture correlated and the pose correlated initial shapes are joined together as the robust initialization. We evaluate RICPR on the challenging dataset of COFW. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better performances than the state-of-the-art methods in facial landmark localization and occlusion detection. 
### 259.A Deeply-Recursive Convolutional Network for Crowd Counting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05633.pdf)
> The estimation of crowd count in images has a wide range of applications such as video surveillance, traffic monitoring, public safety and urban planning. Recently, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches have been shown to be more effective in crowd counting than traditional methods that use handcrafted features. However, the existing CNN-based methods still suffer from large number of parameters and large storage space, which require high storage and computing resources and thus limit the real-world application. Consequently, we propose a deeply-recursive network (DR-ResNet) based on ResNet blocks for crowd counting. The recursive structure makes the network deeper while keeping the number of parameters unchanged, which enhances network capability to capture statistical regularities in the context of the crowd. Besides, we generate a new dataset from the video-monitoring data of Beijing bus station. Experimental results have demonstrated that proposed method outperforms most state-of-the-art methods with far less number of parameters. 
### 260.MEnet: A Metric Expression Network for Salient Object Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05638.pdf)
> Recent CNN-based saliency models have achieved great performance on public datasets, however, most of them are sensitive to distortion (e.g., noise, compression). In this paper, an end-to-end generic salient object segmentation model called Metric Expression Network (MEnet) is proposed to overcome this drawback. Within this architecture, we construct a new topological metric space, with the implicit metric being determined by the deep network. In this way, we succeed in grouping all the pixels within the observed image semantically within this latent space into two regions: a salient region and a non-salient region. With this method, all feature extractions are carried out at the pixel level, which makes the output boundaries of salient object fine-grained. Experimental results show that the proposed metric can generate robust salient maps that allow for object segmentation. By testing the method on several public benchmarks, we show that the performance of MEnet has achieved good results. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms previous CNN-based methods on distorted images. 
### 261.Distribution-based Label Space Transformation for Multi-label Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05687.pdf)
> Multi-label learning problems have manifested themselves in various machine learning applications. The key to successful multi-label learning algorithms lies in the exploration of inter-label correlations, which usually incur great computational cost. Another notable factor in multi-label learning is that the label vectors are usually extremely sparse, especially when the candidate label vocabulary is very large and only a few instances are assigned to each category. Recently, a label space transformation (LST) framework has been proposed targeting these challenges. However, current methods based on LST usually suffer from information loss in the label space dimension reduction process and fail to address the sparsity problem effectively. In this paper, we propose a distribution-based label space transformation (DLST) model. By defining the distribution based on the similarity of label vectors, a more comprehensive label structure can be captured. Then, by minimizing KL-divergence of two distributions, the information of the original label space can be approximately preserved in the latent space. Consequently, multi-label classifier trained using the dense latent codes yields better performance. The leverage of distribution enables DLST to fill out additional information about the label correlations. This endows DLST the capability to handle label set sparsity and training data sparsity in multi-label learning problems. With the optimal latent code, a kernel logistic regression function is learned for the mapping from feature space to the latent space. Then ML-KNN is employed to recover the original label vector from the transformed latent code. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DLST not only achieves high classification performance but also is computationally more efficient. 
### 262.2sRanking-CNN: A 2-stage ranking-CNN for diagnosis of glaucoma from  fundus images using CAM-extracted ROI as an intermediate input [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05727.pdf)
> Glaucoma is a disease in which the optic nerve is chronically damaged by the elevation of the intra-ocular pressure, resulting in visual field defect. Therefore, it is important to monitor and treat suspected patients before they are confirmed with glaucoma. In this paper, we propose a 2-stage ranking-CNN that classifies fundus images as normal, suspicious, and glaucoma. Furthermore, we propose a method of using the class activation map as a mask filter and combining it with the original fundus image as an intermediate input. Our results have improved the average accuracy by about 10% over the existing 3-class CNN and ranking-CNN, and especially improved the sensitivity of suspicious class by more than 20% over 3-class CNN. In addition, the extracted ROI was also found to overlap with the diagnostic criteria of the physician. The method we propose is expected to be efficiently applied to any medical data where there is a suspicious condition between normal and disease. 
### 263.Robust Adaptive Median Binary Pattern for noisy texture classification  and retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05732.pdf)
> Texture is an important cue for different computer vision tasks and applications. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is considered one of the best yet efficient texture descriptors. However, LBP has some notable limitations, mostly the sensitivity to noise. In this paper, we address these criteria by introducing a novel texture descriptor, Robust Adaptive Median Binary Pattern (RAMBP). RAMBP based on classification process of noisy pixels, adaptive analysis window, scale analysis and image regions median comparison. The proposed method handles images with high noisy textures, and increases the discriminative properties by capturing microstructure and macrostructure texture information. The proposed method has been evaluated on popular texture datasets for classification and retrieval tasks, and under different high noise conditions. Without any train or prior knowledge of noise type, RAMBP achieved the best classification compared to state-of-the-art techniques. It scored more than $90\%$ under $50\%$ impulse noise densities, more than $95\%$ under Gaussian noised textures with standard deviation $\sigma = 5$, and more than $99\%$ under Gaussian blurred textures with standard deviation $\sigma = 1.25$. The proposed method yielded competitive results and high performance as one of the best descriptors in noise-free texture classification. Furthermore, RAMBP showed also high performance for the problem of noisy texture retrieval providing high scores of recall and precision measures for textures with high levels of noise. 
### 264.Multi-label Classification of Surgical Tools with Convolutional Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05760.pdf)
> Automatic tool detection from surgical imagery has a multitude of useful applications, such as real-time computer assistance for the surgeon. Using the successful residual network architecture, a system that can distinguish 21 different tools in cataract surgery videos is created. The videos are provided as part of the 2017 CATARACTS challenge and pose difficulties found in many real-world datasets, for example a strong class imbalance. The construction of the detection system is guided by a wide array of experiments that explore different design decisions. 
### 265.Crick-net: A Convolutional Neural Network based Classification Approach  for Detecting Waist High No Balls in Cricket [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05974.pdf)
> Cricket is undoubtedly one of the most popular games in this modern era. As human beings are prone to error, there remains a constant need for automated analysis and decision making of different events in this game. Simultaneously, with advent and advances in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, application of these two in different domains has become an emerging trend. Applying several computer vision techniques in analyzing different Cricket events and automatically coming into decisions has become popular in recent days. In this paper, we have deployed a CNN based classification method with Inception V3 in order to automatically detect and differentiate waist high no balls with fair balls. Our approach achieves an overall average accuracy of 88% with a fairly low cross-entropy value. 
### 266.String Methods for Stochastic Image and Shape Matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06038.pdf)
> Matching of images and analysis of shape differences is traditionally pursued by energy minimization of paths of deformations acting to match the shape objects. In the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework, iterative gradient descents on the matching functional lead to matching algorithms informally known as Beg algorithms. When stochasticity is introduced to model stochastic variability of shapes and to provide more realistic models of observed shape data, the corresponding matching problem can be solved with a stochastic Beg algorithm, similar to the finite temperature string method used in rare event sampling. In this paper, we apply a stochastic model compatible with the geometry of the LDDMM framework to obtain a stochastic model of images and we derive the stochastic version of the Beg algorithm which we compare with the string method and an expectation-maximization optimization of posterior likelihoods. The algorithm and its use for statistical inference is tested on stochastic LDDMM landmarks and images. 
### 267.Vision-based Automated Bridge Component Recognition Integrated With  High-level Scene Understanding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06041.pdf)
> Image data has a great potential of helping conventional visual inspections of civil engineering structures due to the ease of data acquisition and the advantages in capturing visual information. A variety of techniques have been proposed to detect damages, such as cracks and spalling on a close-up image of a single component (columns and road surfaces etc.). However, these techniques commonly suffer from severe false-positives especially when the image includes multiple components of different structures. To reduce the false-positives and extract reliable information about the structures' conditions, detection and localization of critical structural components are important first steps preceding the damage assessment. This study aims at recognizing bridge structural and non-structural components from images of urban scenes. During the bridge component recognition, every image pixel is classified into one of the five classes (non-bridge, columns, beams and slabs, other structural, other nonstructural) by multi-scale convolutional neural networks (multi-scale CNNs). To reduce false-positives and get consistent labels, the component classifications are integrated with scene understanding by an additional classifier with 10 higher-level scene classes (building, greenery, person, pavement, signs and poles, vehicles, bridges, water, sky, and others). The bridge component recognition integrated with the scene understanding is compared with the naive approach without scene classification in terms of accuracy, false-positives and consistencies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated approach. 
### 268.Automated Vision-based Bridge Component Extraction Using Multiscale  Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06042.pdf)
> Image data has a great potential of helping post-earthquake visual inspections of civil engineering structures due to the ease of data acquisition and the advantages in capturing visual information. A variety of techniques have been applied to detect damages automatically from a close-up image of a structural component. However, the application of the automatic damage detection methods become increasingly difficult when the image includes multiple components from different structures. To reduce the inaccurate false positive alarms, critical structural components need to be recognized first, and the damage alarms need to be cleaned using the component recognition results. To achieve the goal, this study aims at recognizing and extracting bridge components from images of urban scenes. The bridge component recognition begins with pixel-wise classifications of an image into 10 scene classes. Then, the original image and the scene classification results are combined to classify the image pixels into five component classes. The multi-scale convolutional neural networks (multi-scale CNNs) are used to perform pixel-wise classification, and the classification results are post-processed by averaging within superpixels and smoothing by conditional random fields (CRFs). The performance of the bridge component extraction is tested in terms of accuracy and consistency. 
### 269.Visual Representations for Semantic Target Driven Navigation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06066.pdf)
> What is a good visual representation for autonomous agents? We address this question in the context of semantic visual navigation, which is the problem of a robot finding its way through a complex environment to a target object, e.g. go to the refrigerator. Instead of acquiring a metric semantic map of an environment and using planning for navigation, our approach learns navigation policies on top of representations that capture spatial layout and semantic contextual cues. We propose to using high level semantic and contextual features including segmentation and detection masks obtained by off-the-shelf state-of- the-art vision as observations and use deep network to learn the navigation policy. This choice allows using additional data, from orthogonal sources, to better train different parts of the model the representation extraction is trained on large standard vision datasets while the navigation component leverages large synthetic environments for training. This combination of real and synthetic is possible because equitable feature representations are available in both (e.g., segmentation and detection masks), which alleviates the need for domain adaptation. Both the representation and the navigation policy can be readily applied to real non-synthetic environments as demonstrated on the Active Vision Dataset [1]. Our approach gets successfully to the target in 54% of the cases in unexplored environments, compared to 46% for non-learning based approach, and 28% for the learning-based baseline. 
### 270.Optical Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06082.pdf)
> We develop a novel optical neural network (ONN) framework which introduces a degree of scalar invariance to image classification estima- tion. Taking a hint from the human eye, which has higher resolution near the center of the retina, images are broken out into multiple levels of varying zoom based on a focal point. Each level is passed through an identical convolutional neural network (CNN) in a Siamese fashion, and the results are recombined to produce a high accuracy estimate of the object class. ONNs act as a wrapper around existing CNNs, and can thus be applied to many existing algorithms to produce notable accuracy improvements without having to change the underlying architecture. 
### 271.PACT: Parameterized Clipping Activation for Quantized Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06085.pdf)
> Deep learning algorithms achieve high classification accuracy at the expense of significant computation cost. To address this cost, a number of quantization schemes have been proposed - but most of these techniques focused on quantizing weights, which are relatively smaller in size compared to activations. This paper proposes a novel quantization scheme for activations during training - that enables neural networks to work well with ultra low precision weights and activations without any significant accuracy degradation. This technique, PArameterized Clipping acTivation (PACT), uses an activation clipping parameter $\alpha$ that is optimized during training to find the right quantization scale. PACT allows quantizing activations to arbitrary bit precisions, while achieving much better accuracy relative to published state-of-the-art quantization schemes. We show, for the first time, that both weights and activations can be quantized to 4-bits of precision while still achieving accuracy comparable to full precision networks across a range of popular models and datasets. We also show that exploiting these reduced-precision computational units in hardware can enable a super-linear improvement in inferencing performance due to a significant reduction in the area of accelerator compute engines coupled with the ability to retain the quantized model and activation data in on-chip memories. 
### 272.An Evaluation of Deep CNN Baselines for Scene-Independent Person  Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06086.pdf)
> In recent years, a variety of proposed methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have improved the state of the art for large-scale person re-identification (ReID). While a large number of optimizations and network improvements have been proposed, there has been relatively little evaluation of the influence of training data and baseline network architecture. In particular, it is usually assumed either that networks are trained on labeled data from the deployment location (scene-dependent), or else adapted with unlabeled data, both of which complicate system deployment. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of achieving scene-independent person ReID by forming a large composite dataset for training. We present an in-depth comparison of several CNN baseline architectures for both scene-dependent and scene-independent ReID, across a range of training dataset sizes. We show that scene-independent ReID can produce leading-edge results, competitive with unsupervised domain adaption techniques. Finally, we introduce a new dataset for comparing within-camera and across-camera person ReID. 
### 273.Crowd Counting by Adaptively Fusing Predictions from an Image Pyramid [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06115.pdf)
> Because of the powerful learning capability of deep neural networks, counting performance via density map estimation has improved significantly during the past several years. However, it is still very challenging due to severe occlusion, large scale variations, and perspective distortion. Scale variations (from image to image) coupled with perspective distortion (within one image) resulting in huge scale changes of the object size. Earlier methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) typically did not handle this scale variation explicitly, until Hydra-CNN and MCNN. MCNN uses three columns, each with different filter sizes, to extract features at different scales. In this paper, in contrast to using filters of different sizes, we utilize an image pyramid to deal with scale variations. It is more effective and efficient to resize the input fed into the network, as compared to using larger filter sizes. Secondly, we adaptively fuse the predictions from different scales (using adaptively changing per-pixel weights), which makes our method adapt to scale changes within an image. The adaptive fusing is achieved by generating an across-scale attention map, which softly selects a suitable scale for each pixel, followed by a 1x1 convolution. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets show very compelling results. 
### 274.Feature Affinity based Pseudo Labeling for Semi-supervised Person  Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06118.pdf)
> Person re-identification aims to match a person's identity across multiple camera streams. Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to the challenging person re-identification task. One remarkable bottleneck is that the existing deep models are data hungry and require large amounts of labeled training data. Acquiring manual annotations for pedestrian identity matchings in large-scale surveillance camera installations is a highly cumbersome task. Here, we propose the first semi-supervised approach that performs pseudo-labeling by considering complex relationships between unlabeled and labeled training samples in the feature space. Our approach first approximates the actual data manifold by learning a generative model via adversarial training. Given the trained model, data augmentation can be performed by generating new synthetic data samples which are unlabeled. An open research problem is how to effectively use this additional data for improved feature learning. To this end, this work proposes a novel Feature Affinity based Pseudo-Labeling (FAPL) approach with two possible label encodings under a unified setting. Our approach measures the affinity of unlabeled samples with the underlying clusters of labeled data samples using the intermediate feature representations from deep networks. FAPL trains with the joint supervision of cross-entropy loss together with a center regularization term, which not only ensures discriminative feature representation learning but also simultaneously predicts pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. Our extensive experiments on two standard large-scale datasets, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, demonstrate significant performance boosts over closely related competitors and outperforms state-of-the-art person re-identification techniques in most cases. 
### 275.Photorealistic Image Reconstruction from Hybrid Intensity and Event  based Sensor [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06140.pdf)
> Event based sensors encode pixel wise contrast changes as positive or negative events at the instant they occur. This paradigm shift away from conventional image sensors provides advantages like low bandwidth requirement, low operating power requirement and low latency. However, in the process of encoding these contrast changes most of the spatial intensity information is lost. Previously there have been attempts at recovering this lost intensity information directly from the event data. Although the results are promising they lack the texture and the consistency of natural videos. We propose to reconstruct photorealistic intensity images by using a low frame rate conventional camera along with the event sensor. The low frame rate conventional camera provides us with texture-rich information, while the event sensor provides us with dense temporal measurements. We combine the strength of both by warping the low-frame rate video to intermediate locations where we only have event sensor data, resulting in high frame rate video. For accomplishing this task, we need the knowledge of scene depth and dense ego-motion estimates. We propose to use an unsupervised, learning free method to estimate depth from low-frame rate images. Unlike previous works, instead of estimating ego-motion directly from events, we propose an autoencoder based model to map events to pseudo-intensity frames. Using pseudo-intensity frames as input, we propose an unsupervised, learning free method adapted from Deep Image Prior to estimate the sensor ego-motion. Finally, we demonstrate photo-realistic reconstructions on a real hybrid sensor (DAVIS) dataset. 
### 276.Critical Points to Determine Persistence Homology [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06148.pdf)
> Computation of the simplicial complexes of a large point cloud often relies on extracting a sample, to reduce the associated computational burden. The study considers sampling critical points of a Morse function associated to a point cloud, to approximate the Vietoris-Rips complex or the witness complex and compute persistence homology. The effectiveness of the novel approach is compared with the farthest point sampling, in a context of classifying human face images into ethnics groups using persistence homology. 
### 277.Zero-Shot Object Detection by Hybrid Region Embedding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06157.pdf)
> Object detection is considered as one of the most challenging problems in computer vision, since it requires correct prediction of both classes and locations of objects in images. In this study, we define a more difficult scenario, namely zero-shot object detection (ZSD) where no visual training data is available for some of the target object classes. We present a novel approach to tackle this ZSD problem, where a convex combination of embeddings are used in conjunction with a detection framework. For evaluation of ZSD methods, we propose a simple dataset constructed from Fashion-MNIST images and also a custom zero-shot split for the Pascal VOC detection challenge. The experimental results suggest that our method yields promising results for ZSD. 
### 278.Lightweight Pyramid Networks for Image Deraining [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06173.pdf)
> Existing deep convolutional neural networks have found major success in image deraining, but at the expense of an enormous number of parameters. This limits their potential application, for example in mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a lightweight pyramid of networks (LPNet) for single image deraining. Instead of designing a complex network structures, we use domain-specific knowledge to simplify the learning process. Specifically, we find that by introducing the mature Gaussian-Laplacian image pyramid decomposition technology to the neural network, the learning problem at each pyramid level is greatly simplified and can be handled by a relatively shallow network with few parameters. We adopt recursive and residual network structures to build the proposed LPNet, which has less than 8K parameters while still achieving state-of-the-art performance on rain removal. We also discuss the potential value of LPNet for other low- and high-level vision tasks. 
### 279.Graph Edge Convolutional Neural Networks for Skeleton Based Action  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06184.pdf)
> This paper investigates body bones from skeleton data for skeleton based action recognition. Body joints, as the direct result of mature pose estimation technologies, are always the key concerns of traditional action recognition methods. However, instead of joints, we humans naturally identify how the human body moves according to shapes, lengths and places of bones, which are more obvious and stable for observation. Hence given graphs generated from skeleton data, we propose to develop convolutions over graph edges that correspond to bones in human skeleton. We describe an edge by integrating its spatial neighboring edges to explore the cooperation between different bones, as well as its temporal neighboring edges to address the consistency of movements in an action. A graph edge convolutional neural network is then designed for skeleton based action recognition. Considering the complementarity between graph node convolution and graph edge convolution, we additionally construct two hybrid neural networks to combine graph node convolutional neural network and graph edge convolutional neural network using shared intermediate layers. Experimental results on Kinetics and NTU-RGB+D datasets demonstrate that our graph edge convolution is effective to capture characteristic of actions and our graph edge convolutional neural network significantly outperforms existing state-of-art skeleton based action recognition methods. Additionally, more performance improvements can be achieved by the hybrid networks. 
### 280.Predicting the Next Best View for 3D Mesh Refinement [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06207.pdf)
> 3D reconstruction is a core task in many applications such as robot navigation or sites inspections. Finding the best poses to capture part of the scene is one of the most challenging topic that goes under the name of Next Best View. Recently, many volumetric methods have been proposed; they choose the Next Best View by reasoning over a 3D voxelized space and by finding which pose minimizes the uncertainty decoded into the voxels. Such methods are effective, but they do not scale well since the underlaying representation requires a huge amount of memory. In this paper we propose a novel mesh-based approach which focuses on the worst reconstructed region of the environment mesh. We define a photo-consistent index to evaluate the 3D mesh accuracy, and an energy function over the worst regions of the mesh which takes into account the mutual parallax with respect to the previous cameras, the angle of incidence of the viewing ray to the surface and the visibility of the region. We test our approach over a well known dataset and achieve state-of-the-art results. 
### 281.Adversarial Training for Patient-Independent Feature Learning with IVOCT  Data for Plaque Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06223.pdf)
> Deep learning methods have shown impressive results for a variety of medical problems over the last few years. However, datasets tend to be small due to time-consuming annotation. As datasets with different patients are often very heterogeneous generalization to new patients can be difficult. This is complicated further if large differences in image acquisition can occur, which is common during intravascular optical coherence tomography for coronary plaque imaging. We address this problem with an adversarial training strategy where we force a part of a deep neural network to learn features that are independent of patient- or acquisitionspecific characteristics. We compare our regularization method to typical data augmentation strategies and show that our approach improves performance for a small medical dataset. 
### 282.Image Classification Based on Quantum KNN Algorithm [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06260.pdf)
> Image classification is an important task in the field of machine learning and image processing. However, the usually used classification method --- the K Nearest-Neighbor algorithm has high complexity, because its two main processes: similarity computing and searching are time-consuming. Especially in the era of big data, the problem is prominent when the amount of images to be classified is large. In this paper, we try to use the powerful parallel computing ability of quantum computers to optimize the efficiency of image classification. The scheme is based on quantum K Nearest-Neighbor algorithm. Firstly, the feature vectors of images are extracted on classical computers. Then the feature vectors are inputted into a quantum superposition state, which is used to achieve parallel computing of similarity. Next, the quantum minimum search algorithm is used to speed up searching process for similarity. Finally, the image is classified by quantum measurement. The complexity of the quantum algorithm is only O((kM)^(1/2)), which is superior to the classical algorithms. Moreover, the measurement step is executed only once to ensure the validity of the scheme. The experimental results show that, the classification accuracy is 83.1% on Graz-01 dataset and 78% on Caltech-101 dataset, which is close to existing classical algorithms. Hence, our quantum scheme has a good classification performance while greatly improving the efficiency. 
### 283.SAVERS: SAR ATR with Verification Support Based on Convolutional Neural  Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06298.pdf)
> We propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) which performs coarse and fine segmentation for end-to-end synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) system. In recent years, many CNNs for SAR ATR using deep learning have been proposed, but most of them classify target classes from fixed size target chips extracted from SAR imagery. On the other hand, we proposed the CNN which outputs the score of the multiple target classes and a background class for each pixel from the SAR imagery of arbitrary size and multiple targets as fine segmentation. However, it was necessary for humans to judge the CNN segmentation result. In this report, we propose a CNN called SAR ATR with verification support (SAVERS), which performs region-wise (i.e. coarse) segmentation and pixel-wise segmentation. SAVERS discriminates between target and non-target, and classifies multiple target classes and non-target class by coarse segmentation. This report describes the evaluation results of SAVERS using the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset. 
### 284.Fully Associative Patch-based 1-to-N Matcher for Face Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06306.pdf)
> This paper focuses on improving face recognition performance by a patch-based 1-to-N signature matcher that learns correlations between different facial patches. A Fully Associative Patch-based Signature Matcher (FAPSM) is proposed so that the local matching identity of each patch contributes to the global matching identities of all the patches. The proposed matcher consists of three steps. First, based on the signature, the local matching identity and the corresponding matching score of each patch are computed. Then, a fully associative weight matrix is learned to obtain the global matching identities and scores of all the patches. At last, the l1-regularized weighting is applied to combine the global matching identity of each patch and obtain a final matching identity. The proposed matcher has been integrated with the UR2D system for evaluation. The experimental results indicate that the proposed matcher achieves better performance than the current UR2D system. The Rank-1 accuracy is improved significantly by 3% and 0.55% on the UHDB31 dataset and the IJB-A dataset, respectively. 
### 285.Robust and Efficient Graph Correspondence Transfer for Person  Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06323.pdf)
> Spatial misalignment caused by variations in poses and viewpoints is one of the most critical issues that hinders the performance improvement in existing person re-identification (Re-ID) algorithms. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a robust and efficient graph correspondence transfer (REGCT) approach for explicit spatial alignment in Re-ID. Specifically, we propose to establish the patch-wise correspondences of positive training pairs via graph matching. By exploiting both spatial and visual contexts of human appearance in graph matching, meaningful semantic correspondences can be obtained. To circumvent the cumbersome \emph{on-line} graph matching in testing phase, we propose to transfer the \emph{off-line} learned patch-wise correspondences from the positive training pairs to test pairs. In detail, for each test pair, the training pairs with similar pose-pair configurations are selected as references. The matching patterns (i.e., the correspondences) of the selected references are then utilized to calculate the patch-wise feature distances of this test pair. To enhance the robustness of correspondence transfer, we design a novel pose context descriptor to accurately model human body configurations, and present an approach to measure the similarity between a pair of pose context descriptors. Meanwhile, to improve testing efficiency, we propose a correspondence template ensemble method using the voting mechanism, which significantly reduces the amount of patch-wise matchings involved in distance calculation. With aforementioned strategies, the REGCT model can effectively and efficiently handle the spatial misalignment problem in Re-ID. Extensive experiments on five challenging benchmarks, including VIPeR, Road, PRID450S, 3DPES and CUHK01, evidence the superior performance of REGCT over other state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 286.Robust 6D Object Pose Estimation with Stochastic Congruent Sets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06324.pdf)
> Object pose estimation is frequently achieved by first segmenting an RGB image and then, given depth data, registering the corresponding point cloud segment against the object's 3D model. Despite the progress due to CNNs, semantic segmentation output can be noisy, especially when the CNN is only trained on synthetic data. This causes registration methods to fail in estimating a good object pose. This work proposes a novel stochastic optimization process that treats the segmentation output of CNNs as a confidence probability. The algorithm, called Stochastic Congruent Sets (StoCS), samples pointsets on the point cloud according to the soft segmentation distribution and so as to agree with the object's known geometry. The pointsets are then matched to congruent sets on the 3D object model to generate pose estimates. StoCS is shown to be robust on an APC dataset, despite the fact the CNN is trained only on synthetic data. In the YCB dataset, StoCS outperforms a recent network for 6D pose estimation and alternative pointset matching techniques. 
### 287.Multi-task Learning for Macromolecule Classification, Segmentation and  Coarse Structural Recovery in Cryo-Tomography [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06332.pdf)
> Cellular Electron Cryo-Tomography (CECT) is a powerful 3D imaging tool for studying the native structure and organization of macromolecules inside single cells. For systematic recognition and recovery of macromolecular structures captured by CECT, methods for several important tasks such as subtomogram classification and semantic segmentation have been developed. However, the recognition and recovery of macromolecular structures are still very difficult due to high molecular structural diversity, crowding molecular environment, and the imaging limitations of CECT. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task 3D convolutional neural network model for simultaneous classification, segmentation, and coarse structural recovery of macromolecules of interest in subtomograms. In our model, the learned image features of one task are shared and thereby mutually reinforce the learning of other tasks. Evaluated on realistically simulated and experimental CECT data, our multi-task learning model outperformed all single-task learning methods for classification and segmentation. In addition, we demonstrate that our model can generalize to discover, segment and recover novel structures that do not exist in the training data. 
### 288.Auxiliary Tasks in Multi-task Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06334.pdf)
> Multi-task convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown impressive results for certain combinations of tasks, such as single-image depth estimation (SIDE) and semantic segmentation. This is achieved by pushing the network towards learning a robust representation that generalizes well to different atomic tasks. We extend this concept by adding auxiliary tasks, which are of minor relevance for the application, to the set of learned tasks. As a kind of additional regularization, they are expected to boost the performance of the ultimately desired main tasks. To study the proposed approach, we picked vision-based road scene understanding (RSU) as an exemplary application. Since multi-task learning requires specialized datasets, particularly when using extensive sets of tasks, we provide a multi-modal dataset for multi-task RSU, called synMT. More than 2.5 $\cdot$ 10^5 synthetic images, annotated with 21 different labels, were acquired from the video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). Our proposed deep multi-task CNN architecture was trained on various combination of tasks using synMT. The experiments confirmed that auxiliary tasks can indeed boost network performance, both in terms of final results and training time. 
### 289.Automatic segmentation of the spinal cord and intramedullary multiple  sclerosis lesions with convolutional neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06349.pdf)
> The spinal cord is frequently affected by atrophy and/or lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Segmentation of the spinal cord and lesions from MRI data provides measures of damage, which are key criteria for the diagnosis, prognosis, and longitudinal monitoring in MS. Automating this operation eliminates inter-rater variability and increases the efficiency of large-throughput analysis pipelines. Robust and reliable segmentation across multi-site spinal cord data is challenging because of the large variability related to acquisition parameters and image artifacts. The goal of this study was to develop a fully-automatic framework, robust to variability in both image parameters and clinical condition, for segmentation of the spinal cord and intramedullary MS lesions from conventional MRI data. Scans of 1,042 subjects (459 healthy controls, 471 MS patients, and 112 with other spinal pathologies) were included in this multi-site study (n=30). Data spanned three contrasts (T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted) for a total of 1,943 volumes. The proposed cord and lesion automatic segmentation approach is based on a sequence of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To deal with the very small proportion of spinal cord and/or lesion voxels compared to the rest of the volume, a first CNN with 2D dilated convolutions detects the spinal cord centerline, followed by a second CNN with 3D convolutions that segments the spinal cord and/or lesions. When compared against manual segmentation, our CNN-based approach showed a median Dice of 95% vs. 88% for PropSeg, a state-of-the-art spinal cord segmentation method. Regarding lesion segmentation on MS data, our framework provided a Dice of 60%, a relative volume difference of -15%, and a lesion-wise detection sensitivity and precision of 83% and 77%, respectively. The proposed framework is open-source and readily available in the Spinal Cord Toolbox. 
### 290.Object detection at 200 Frames Per Second [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06361.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose an efficient and fast object detector which can process hundreds of frames per second. To achieve this goal we investigate three main aspects of the object detection framework: network architecture, loss function and training data (labeled and unlabeled). In order to obtain compact network architecture, we introduce various improvements, based on recent work, to develop an architecture which is computationally light-weight and achieves a reasonable performance. To further improve the performance, while keeping the complexity same, we utilize distillation loss function. Using distillation loss we transfer the knowledge of a more accurate teacher network to proposed light-weight student network. We propose various innovations to make distillation efficient for the proposed one stage detector pipeline: objectness scaled distillation loss, feature map non-maximal suppression and a single unified distillation loss function for detection. Finally, building upon the distillation loss, we explore how much can we push the performance by utilizing the unlabeled data. We train our model with unlabeled data using the soft labels of the teacher network. Our final network consists of 10x fewer parameters than the VGG based object detection network and it achieves a speed of more than 200 FPS and proposed changes improve the detection accuracy by 14 mAP over the baseline on Pascal dataset. 
### 291.Fast Retinomorphic Event Stream for Video Recognition and Reinforcement  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06374.pdf)
> Good temporal representations are crucial for video understanding, and the state-of-the-art video recognition framework is based on two-stream networks. In such framework, besides the regular ConvNets responsible for RGB frame inputs, a second network is introduced to handle the temporal representation, usually the optical flow (OF). However, OF or other task-oriented flow is computationally costly, and is thus typically pre-computed. Critically, this prevents the two-stream approach from being applied to reinforcement learning (RL) applications such as video game playing, where the next state depends on current state and action choices. Inspired by the early vision systems of mammals and insects, we propose a fast event-driven representation (EDR) that models several major properties of early retinal circuits: (1) logarithmic input response, (2) multi-timescale temporal smoothing to filter noise, and (3) bipolar (ON/OFF) pathways for primitive event detection[12]. Trading off the directional information for fast speed (&gt; 9000 fps), EDR en-ables fast real-time inference/learning in video applications that require interaction between an agent and the world such as game-playing, virtual robotics, and domain adaptation. In this vein, we use EDR to demonstrate performance improvements over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for Atari games, something that has not been possible with pre-computed OF. Moreover, with UCF-101 video action recognition experiments, we show that EDR performs near state-of-the-art in accuracy while achieving a 1,500x speedup in input representation processing, as compared to optical flow. 
### 292.When Regression Meets Manifold Learning for Object Recognition and Pose  Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06400.pdf)
> In this work, we propose a method for object recognition and pose estimation from depth images using convolutional neural networks. Previous methods addressing this problem rely on manifold learning to learn low dimensional viewpoint descriptors and employ them in a nearest neighbor search on an estimated descriptor space. In comparison we create an efficient multi-task learning framework combining manifold descriptor learning and pose regression. By combining the strengths of manifold learning using triplet loss and pose regression, we could either estimate the pose directly reducing the complexity compared to NN search, or use learned descriptor for the NN descriptor matching. By in depth experimental evaluation of the novel loss function we observed that the view descriptors learned by the network are much more discriminative resulting in almost 30% increase regarding relative pose accuracy compared to related works. On the other hand, regarding directly regressed poses we obtained important improvement compared to simple pose regression. By leveraging the advantages of both manifold learning and regression tasks, we are able to improve the current state-of-the-art for object recognition and pose retrieval that we demonstrate through in depth experimental evaluation. 
### 293.Deep Segmentation and Registration in X-Ray Angiography Video [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06406.pdf)
> In interventional radiology, short video sequences of vein structure in motion are captured in order to help medical personnel identify vascular issues or plan intervention. Semantic segmentation can greatly improve the usefulness of these videos by indicating exact position of vessels and instruments, thus reducing the ambiguity. We propose a real-time segmentation method for these tasks, based on U-Net network trained in a Siamese architecture from automatically generated annotations. We make use of noisy low level binary segmentation and optical flow to generate multi class annotations that are successively improved in a multistage segmentation approach. We significantly improve the performance of a state of the art U-Net at the processing speeds of 90fps. 
### 294.Spatial Transformer Introspective Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06447.pdf)
> Natural images contain many variations such as illumination differences, affine transformations, and shape distortions. Correctly classifying these variations poses a long standing problem. The most commonly adopted solution is to build large-scale datasets that contain objects under different variations. However, this approach is not ideal since it is computationally expensive and it is hard to cover all variations in one single dataset. Towards addressing this difficulty, we propose the spatial transformer introspective neural network (ST-INN) that explicitly generates samples with the unseen affine transformation variations in the training set. Experimental results indicate ST-INN achieves classification accuracy improvements on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, affNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10. We further extend our method to cross dataset classification tasks and few-shot learning problems to verify our method under extreme conditions and observe substantial improvements from experiment results. 
### 295.QuaterNet: A Quaternion-based Recurrent Model for Human Motion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06485.pdf)
> Deep learning for predicting or generating 3D human pose sequences is an active research area. Previous work regresses either joint rotations or joint positions. The former strategy is prone to error accumulation along the kinematic chain, as well as discontinuities when using Euler angle or exponential map parameterizations. The latter requires re-projection onto skeleton constraints to avoid bone stretching and invalid configurations. This work addresses both limitations. Our recurrent network, QuaterNet, represents rotations with quaternions and our loss function performs forward kinematics on a skeleton to penalize absolute position errors instead of angle errors. On short-term predictions, QuaterNet improves the state-of-the-art quantitatively. For long-term generation, our approach is qualitatively judged as realistic as recent neural strategies from the graphics literature. 
### 296.Defoiling Foiled Image Captions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06549.pdf)
> We address the task of detecting foiled image captions, i.e. identifying whether a caption contains a word that has been deliberately replaced by a semantically similar word, thus rendering it inaccurate with respect to the image being described. Solving this problem should in principle require a fine-grained understanding of images to detect linguistically valid perturbations in captions. In such contexts, encoding sufficiently descriptive image information becomes a key challenge. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to solve this task using simple, interpretable yet powerful representations based on explicit object information. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a standard dataset, with scores exceeding those achieved by humans on the task. We also measure the upper-bound performance of our models using gold standard annotations. Our analysis reveals that the simpler model performs well even without image information, suggesting that the dataset contains strong linguistic bias. 
### 297.Recurrent Neural Network for Learning DenseDepth and Ego-Motion from  Video [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06558.pdf)
> Learning-based, single-view depth estimation often generalizes poorly to unseen datasets. While learning-based, two-frame depth estimation solves this problem to some extent by learning to match features across frames, it performs poorly at large depth where the uncertainty is high. There exists few learning-based, multi-view depth estimation methods. In this paper, we present a learning-based, multi-view dense depth map and ego-motion estimation method that uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Our model is designed for 3D reconstruction from video where the input frames are temporally correlated. It is generalizable to single- or two-view dense depth estimation. Compared to recent single- or two-view CNN-based depth estimation methods, our model leverages more views and achieves more accurate results, especially at large distances. Our method produces superior results to the state-of-the-art learning-based, single- or two-view depth estimation methods on both indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that our method can even work on extremely difficult sequences, such as endoscopic video, where none of the assumptions (static scene, constant lighting, Lambertian reflection, etc.) from traditional 3D reconstruction methods hold. 
### 298.DeepGlobe 2018: A Challenge to Parse the Earth through Satellite Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06561.pdf)
> We present the DeepGlobe 2018 Satellite Image Understanding Challenge, which includes three public competitions for segmentation, detection, and classification tasks on satellite images. Similar to other challenges in computer vision domain such as DAVIS and COCO, DeepGlobe proposes three datasets and corresponding evaluation methodologies, coherently bundled in three competitions with a dedicated workshop co-located with CVPR 2018. <br />We observed that satellite imagery is a rich and structured source of information, yet it is less investigated than everyday images by computer vision researchers. However, bridging modern computer vision with remote sensing data analysis could have critical impact to the way we understand our environment and lead to major breakthroughs in global urban planning or climate change research. Keeping such bridging objective in mind, DeepGlobe aims to bring together researchers from different domains to raise awareness of remote sensing in the computer vision community and vice-versa. We aim to improve and evaluate state-of-the-art satellite image understanding approaches, which can hopefully serve as reference benchmarks for future research in the same topic. In this paper, we analyze characteristics of each dataset, define the evaluation criteria of the competitions, and provide baselines for each task. 
### 299.Defense-GAN: Protecting Classifiers Against Adversarial Attacks Using  Generative Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06605.pdf)
> In recent years, deep neural network approaches have been widely adopted for machine learning tasks, including classification. However, they were shown to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations: carefully crafted small perturbations can cause misclassification of legitimate images. We propose Defense-GAN, a new framework leveraging the expressive capability of generative models to defend deep neural networks against such attacks. Defense-GAN is trained to model the distribution of unperturbed images. At inference time, it finds a close output to a given image which does not contain the adversarial changes. This output is then fed to the classifier. Our proposed method can be used with any classification model and does not modify the classifier structure or training procedure. It can also be used as a defense against any attack as it does not assume knowledge of the process for generating the adversarial examples. We empirically show that Defense-GAN is consistently effective against different attack methods and improves on existing defense strategies. Our code has been made publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/kabkabm/defensegan">this https URL</a> 
### 300.Optimization of Transfer Learning for Sign Language Recognition  Targeting Mobile Platform [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06618.pdf)
> The target of this research is to experiment, iterate and recommend a system that is successful in recognition of American Sign Language (ASL). It is a challenging as well as an interesting problem that if solved will bring a leap in social and technological aspects alike. In this paper, we propose a real-time recognizer of ASL based on a mobile platform, so that it will have more accessibility and provides an ease of use. The technique implemented is Transfer Learning of new data of Hand gestures for alphabets in ASL to be modelled on various pre-trained high- end models and optimize the best model to run on a mobile platform considering the various limitations of the same during optimization. The data used consists of 27,455 images of 24 alphabets of ASL. The optimized model when ran over a memory-efficient mobile application, provides an accuracy of 95.03% of accurate recognition with an average recognition time of 2.42 seconds. This method ensures considerable discrimination in accuracy and recognition time than the previous research. 
### 301.Structure-preserving Guided Retinal Image Filtering and Its Application  for Optic Disc Analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06625.pdf)
> Retinal fundus photographs have been used in the diagnosis of many ocular diseases such as glaucoma, pathological myopia, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. With the development of computer science, computer aided diagnosis has been developed to process and analyse the retinal images automatically. One of the challenges in the analysis is that the quality of the retinal image is often degraded. For example, a cataract in human lens will attenuate the retinal image, just as a cloudy camera lens which reduces the quality of a photograph. It often obscures the details in the retinal images and posts challenges in retinal image processing and analysing tasks. In this paper, we approximate the degradation of the retinal images as a combination of human-lens attenuation and scattering. A novel structure-preserving guided retinal image filtering (SGRIF) is then proposed to restore images based on the attenuation and scattering model. The proposed SGRIF consists of a step of global structure transferring and a step of global edge-preserving smoothing. Our results show that the proposed SGRIF method is able to improve the contrast of retinal images, measured by histogram flatness measure, histogram spread and variability of local luminosity. In addition, we further explored the benefits of SGRIF for subsequent retinal image processing and analysing tasks. In the two applications of deep learning based optic cup segmentation and sparse learning based cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) computation, our results show that we are able to achieve more accurate optic cup segmentation and CDR measurements from images processed by SGRIF. 
### 302.Joint direct estimation of 3D geometry and 3D motion using spatio  temporal gradients [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06641.pdf)
> Conventional image motion based structure from motion methods first compute optical flow, then solve for the 3D motion parameters based on the epipolar constraint, and finally recover the 3D geometry of the scene. However, errors in optical flow due to regularization can lead to large errors in 3D motion and structure. This paper investigates whether performance and consistency can be improved by avoiding optical flow estimation in the early stages of the structure from motion pipeline, and it proposes a new direct method based on image gradients (normal flow) only. The main idea lies in a reformulation of the positive-depth constraint, which allows the use of well-known minimization techniques to solve for 3D motion. The 3D motion estimate is then refined and structure estimated adding a regularization based on depth. Experimental comparisons on standard synthetic datasets and the real-world driving benchmark dataset KITTI using three different optic flow algorithms show that the method achieves better accuracy in all but one case. Furthermore, it outperforms existing normal flow based 3D motion estimation techniques. Finally, the recovered 3D geometry is shown to be also very accurate. 
### 303.GANomaly: Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection via Adversarial Training [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06725.pdf)
> Anomaly detection is a classical problem in computer vision, namely the determination of the normal from the abnormal when datasets are highly biased towards one class (normal) due to the insufficient sample size of the other class (abnormal). While this can be addressed as a supervised learning problem, a significantly more challenging problem is that of detecting the unknown/unseen anomaly case that takes us instead into the space of a one-class, semi-supervised learning paradigm. We introduce such a novel anomaly detection model, by using a conditional generative adversarial network that jointly learns the generation of high-dimensional image space and the inference of latent space. Employing encoder-decoder-encoder sub-networks in the generator network enables the model to map the input image to a lower dimension vector, which is then used to reconstruct the generated output image. The use of the additional encoder network maps this generated image to its latent representation. Minimizing the distance between these images and the latent vectors during training aids in learning the data distribution for the normal samples. As a result, a larger distance metric from this learned data distribution at inference time is indicative of an outlier from that distribution - an anomaly. Experimentation over several benchmark datasets, from varying domains, shows the model efficacy and superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 304.A Robust Background Initialization Algorithm with Superpixel Motion  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06737.pdf)
> Scene background initialization allows the recovery of a clear image without foreground objects from a video sequence, which is generally the first step in many computer vision and video processing applications. The process may be strongly affected by some challenges such as illumination changes, foreground cluttering, intermittent movement, etc. In this paper, a robust background initialization approach based on superpixel motion detection is proposed. Both spatial and temporal characteristics of frames are adopted to effectively eliminate foreground objects. A subsequence with stable illumination condition is first selected for background estimation. Images are segmented into superpixels to preserve spatial texture information and foreground objects are eliminated by superpixel motion filtering process. A low-complexity density-based clustering is then performed to generate reliable background candidates for final background determination. The approach has been evaluated on SBMnet dataset and it achieves a performance superior or comparable to other state-of-the-art works with faster processing speed. Moreover, in those complex and dynamic categories, the algorithm produces the best results showing the robustness against very challenging scenarios. 
### 305.Minimum Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06741.pdf)
> Face recognition has achieved great progress owing to the fast development of the deep neural network in the past a few years. As an important part of deep neural networks, a number of the loss functions have been proposed which significantly improve the state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we proposed a new loss function called Minimum Margin Loss (MML) which aims at enlarging the margin of those overclose class centre pairs so as to enhance the discriminative ability of the deep features. MML supervises the training process together with the Softmax Loss and the Centre Loss, and also makes up the defect of Softmax + Centre Loss. The experimental results on MegaFace, LFW and YTF datasets show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MML. 
### 306.Action Completion: A Temporal Model for Moment Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06749.pdf)
> We introduce completion moment detection for actions - the problem of locating the moment of completion, when the action's goal is confidently considered achieved. The paper proposes a joint classification-regression recurrent model that predicts completion from a given frame, and then integrates frame-level contributions to detect sequence-level completion moment. We introduce a recurrent voting node that predicts the frame's relative position of the completion moment by either classification or regression. The method is also capable of detecting incompletion. For example, the method is capable of detecting a missed ball-catch, as well as the moment at which the ball is safely caught. We test the method on 16 actions from three public datasets, covering sports as well as daily actions. Results show that when combining contributions from frames prior to the completion moment as well as frames post completion, the completion moment is detected within one second in 89% of all tested sequences. 
### 307.Convolutional Social Pooling for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06771.pdf)
> Forecasting the motion of surrounding vehicles is a critical ability for an autonomous vehicle deployed in complex traffic. Motion of all vehicles in a scene is governed by the traffic context, i.e., the motion and relative spatial configuration of neighboring vehicles. In this paper we propose an LSTM encoder-decoder model that uses convolutional social pooling as an improvement to social pooling layers for robustly learning interdependencies in vehicle motion. Additionally, our model outputs a multi-modal predictive distribution over future trajectories based on maneuver classes. We evaluate our model using the publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 datasets. Our results show improvement over the state of the art in terms of RMS values of prediction error and negative log-likelihoods of true future trajectories under the model's predictive distribution. We also present a qualitative analysis of the model's predicted distributions for various traffic scenarios. 
### 308.Situation Assessment for Planning Lane Changes: Combining Recurrent  Models and Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06776.pdf)
> One of the greatest challenges towards fully autonomous cars is the understanding of complex and dynamic scenes. Such understanding is needed for planning of maneuvers, especially those that are particularly frequent such as lane changes. While in recent years advanced driver-assistance systems have made driving safer and more comfortable, these have mostly focused on car following scenarios, and less on maneuvers involving lane changes. In this work we propose a situation assessment algorithm for classifying driving situations with respect to their suitability for lane changing. For this, we propose a deep learning architecture based on a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network, which uses Long Short-Term Memory units, and integrates a prediction component in the form of the Intelligent Driver Model. We prove the feasibility of our algorithm on the publicly available NGSIM datasets, where we outperform existing methods. 
### 309.Disparity Sliding Window: Object Proposals From Disparity Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06830.pdf)
> Sliding window approaches have been widely used for object recognition tasks in recent years. They guarantee an investigation of the entire input image for the object to be detected and allow a localization of that object. Despite the current trend towards deep neural networks, sliding window methods are still used in combination with convolutional neural networks. The risk of overlooking an object is clearly reduced compared to alternative detection approaches which detect objects based on shape, edges or color. Nevertheless, the sliding window technique strongly increases the computational effort as the classifier has to verify a large number of object candidates. This paper proposes a sliding window approach which also uses depth information from a stereo camera. This leads to a greatly decreased number of object candidates without significantly reducing the detection accuracy. A theoretical investigation of the conventional sliding window approach is presented first. Other publications to date only mentioned rough estimations of the computational cost. A mathematical derivation clarifies the number of object candidates with respect to parameters such as image and object size. Subsequently, the proposed disparity sliding window approach is presented in detail. The approach is evaluated on pedestrian detection with annotations and images from the KITTI object detection benchmark. Furthermore, a comparison with two state-of-the-art methods is made. Code is available in C++ and Python <a href="https://github.com/julimueller/">this https URL</a> disparity-sliding-window. 
### 310.RotDCF: Decomposition of Convolutional Filters for Rotation-Equivariant  Deep Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06846.pdf)
> Explicit encoding of group actions in deep features makes it possible for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle global deformations of images, which is critical to success in many vision tasks. This paper proposes to decompose the convolutional filters over joint steerable bases across the space and the group geometry simultaneously, namely a rotation-equivariant CNN with decomposed convolutional filters (RotDCF). This decomposition facilitates computing the joint convolution, which is proved to be necessary for the group equivariance. It significantly reduces the model size and computational complexity while preserving performance, and truncation of the bases expansion serves implicitly to regularize the filters. On datasets involving in-plane and out-of-plane object rotations, RotDCF deep features demonstrate greater robustness and interpretability than regular CNNs. The stability of the equivariant representation to input variations is also proved theoretically under generic assumptions on the filters in the decomposed form. The RotDCF framework can be extended to groups other than rotations, providing a general approach which achieves both group equivariance and representation stability at a reduced model size. 
### 311.NeuralNetwork-Viterbi: A Framework for Weakly Supervised Video Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06875.pdf)
> Video learning is an important task in computer vision and has experienced increasing interest over the recent years. Since even a small amount of videos easily comprises several million frames, methods that do not rely on a frame-level annotation are of special importance. In this work, we propose a novel learning algorithm with a Viterbi-based loss that allows for online and incremental learning of weakly annotated video data. We moreover show that explicit context and length modeling leads to huge improvements in video segmentation and labeling tasks andinclude these models into our framework. On several action segmentation benchmarks, we obtain an improvement of up to 10% compared to current state-of-the-art methods. 
### 312.It&#x27;s all Relative: Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation from Weakly  Supervised Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06880.pdf)
> We address the problem of 3D human pose estimation from 2D input images using only weakly supervised training data. Despite showing considerable success for 2D pose estimation, the application of supervised machine learning to 3D pose estimation in real world images is currently hampered by the lack of varied training images with corresponding 3D poses. Most existing 3D pose estimation algorithms train on data that has either been collected in carefully controlled studio settings or has been generated synthetically. Instead, we take a different approach, and propose a 3D human pose estimation algorithm that only requires relative estimates of depth at training time. Such training signal, although noisy, can be easily collected from crowd annotators, and is of sufficient quality for enabling successful training and evaluation of 3D pose algorithms. Our results are competitive with fully supervised regression based approaches on the Human3.6M dataset, despite using significantly weaker training data. Our proposed algorithm opens the door to using existing widespread 2D datasets for 3D pose estimation by allowing fine-tuning with noisy relative constraints, resulting in more accurate 3D poses. 
### 313.Fully Convolutional Model for Variable Bit Length and Lossy High Density  Compression of Mammograms [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06909.pdf)
> Early works on medical image compression date to the 1980's with the impetus on deployment of teleradiology systems for high-resolution digital X-ray detectors. Commercially deployed systems during the period could compress 4,096 x 4,096 sized images at 12 bpp to 2 bpp using lossless arithmetic coding, and over the years JPEG and JPEG2000 were imbibed reaching upto 0.1 bpp. Inspired by the reprise of deep learning based compression for natural images over the last two years, we propose a fully convolutional autoencoder for diagnostically relevant feature preserving lossy compression. This is followed by leveraging arithmetic coding for encapsulating high redundancy of features for further high-density code packing leading to variable bit length. We demonstrate performance on two different publicly available digital mammography datasets using peak signal-to-noise ratio (pSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) index and domain adaptability tests between datasets. At high density compression factors of &gt;300x (~0.04 bpp), our approach rivals JPEG and JPEG2000 as evaluated through a Radiologist's visual Turing test. 
### 314.Identifying Object States in Cooking-Related Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06956.pdf)
> Understanding object states is as important as object recognition for robotic task planning and manipulation. This paper explicitly introduces and addresses the state identification problem in computer vision for the first time. In this paper, objects and ingredients in cooking videos are explored and the most frequent objects are analyzed. Eleven states from the most frequent cooking objects are examined and a dataset of images containing those objects and their states is created. As a solution to the state identification problem, a Resnet based deep model is proposed. The model is initialized with Imagenet weights and trained on the dataset of eleven classes. The trained state identification model is evaluated on a subset of the Imagenet dataset and state labels are provided using a combination of the model with manual checking. Moreover, an individual model is fine-tuned for each object in the dataset using the initially trained model and object-specific images, where significant improvement is demonstrated. 
### 315.Generalizing multistain immunohistochemistry tissue segmentation using  one-shot color deconvolution deep neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06958.pdf)
> A key challenge in cancer immunotherapy biomarker research is quantification of pattern changes in microscopic whole slide images of tumor biopsies. Different cell types tend to migrate into various tissue compartments and form variable distribution patterns. Drug development requires correlative analysis of various biomarkers in and between the tissue compartments. To enable that, tissue slides are manually annotated by expert pathologists. Manual annotation of tissue slides is a labor intensive, tedious and error-prone task. Automation of this annotation process can improve accuracy and consistency while reducing workload and cost in a way that will positively influence drug development efforts. In this paper we present a novel one-shot color deconvolution deep learning method to automatically segment and annotate digitized slide images with multiple stainings into compartments of tumor, healthy tissue, and necrosis. We address the task in the context of drug development where multiple stains, tissue and tumor types exist and look into solutions for generalizations over these image populations. 
### 316.Terabyte-scale Deep Multiple Instance Learning for Classification and  Localization in Pathology [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06983.pdf)
> In the field of computational pathology, the use of decision support systems powered by state-of-the-art deep learning solutions has been hampered by the lack of large labeled datasets. Until recently, studies relied on datasets in the order of few hundreds of slides which are not enough to train a model that can work at scale in the clinic. Here, we have gathered a dataset consisting of 12,160 slides, two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets in pathology and equivalent to 25 times the pixel count of the entire ImageNet dataset. Given the size of our dataset it is possible for us to train a deep learning model under the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) assumption where only the overall slide diagnosis is necessary for training, avoiding all the expensive pixel-wise annotations that are usually part of supervised learning approaches. We test our framework on a complex task, that of prostate cancer diagnosis on needle biopsies. We performed a thorough evaluation of the performance of our MIL pipeline under several conditions achieving an AUC of 0.98 on a held-out test set of 1,824 slides. These results open the way for training accurate diagnosis prediction models at scale, laying the foundation for decision support system deployment in the clinic. 
### 317.MDSSD: Multi-scale Deconvolutional Single Shot Detector for Small  Objects [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07009.pdf)
> For most of the object detectors based on multi-scale feature maps, the shallow layers are mainly responsible for small object detection due to their fine details. However, the performance of detecting small object instances is still less satisfactory because of the deficiency of semantic information on shallow features. For the top semantic features, the representation of fine details for small objects are potentially wiped out. In this paper, we design a Multi-scale Deconvolutional Single Shot Detector (MDSSD), especially for the detection of small objects. In MDSSD, to generate features with strong representational power for small object instances, we add the high-level features with rich semantic information to the low-level features via deconvolution Fusion Block. It is noteworthy that multiple high-level features with different scales are upsampled simultaneously in our framework. Afterwards, we implement the skip connections to form more descriptive feature maps for small objects and predictions are made on these new fusion features. Our proposed framework achieves 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC2007 test and 26.8% mAP on MS COCO test-dev2015 at 38.5 FPS with only 300*300 input. The results outperform baseline SSD by 1.1 and 1.7 points respectively, especially with 2 -- 5 points improvement on some small objects categories. 
### 318.Understanding and Improving Deep Neural Network for Activity Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07020.pdf)
> Activity recognition has become a popular research branch in the field of pervasive computing in recent years. A large number of experiments can be obtained that activity sensor-based data's characteristic in activity recognition is variety, volume, and velocity. Deep learning technology, together with its various models, is one of the most effective ways of working on activity data. Nevertheless, there is no clear understanding of why it performs so well or how to make it more effective. In order to solve this problem, first, we applied convolution neural network on Human Activity Recognition Using Smart phones Data Set. Second, we realized the visualization of the sensor-based activity's data features extracted from the neural network. Then we had in-depth analysis of the visualization of features, explored the relationship between activity and features, and analyzed how Neural Networks identify activity based on these features. After that, we extracted the significant features related to the activities and sent the features to the DNN-based fusion model, which improved the classification rate to 96.1%. This is the first work to our knowledge that visualizes abstract sensor-based activity data features. Based on the results, the method proposed in the paper promises to realize the accurate classification of sensor- based activity recognition. 
### 319.Scene Understanding Networks for Autonomous Driving based on Around View  Monitoring System [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07029.pdf)
> Modern driver assistance systems rely on a wide range of sensors (RADAR, LIDAR, ultrasound and cameras) for scene understanding and prediction. These sensors are typically used for detecting traffic participants and scene elements required for navigation. In this paper we argue that relying on camera based systems, specifically Around View Monitoring (AVM) system has great potential to achieve these goals in both parking and driving modes with decreased costs. The contributions of this paper are as follows: we present a new end-to-end solution for delimiting the safe drivable area for each frame by means of identifying the closest obstacle in each direction from the driving vehicle, we use this approach to calculate the distance to the nearest obstacles and we incorporate it into a unified end-to-end architecture capable of joint object detection, curb detection and safe drivable area detection. Furthermore, we describe the family of networks for both a high accuracy solution and a low complexity solution. We also introduce further augmentation of the base architecture with 3D object detection. 
### 320.SemStyle: Learning to Generate Stylised Image Captions using Unaligned  Text [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07030.pdf)
> Linguistic style is an essential part of written communication, with the power to affect both clarity and attractiveness. With recent advances in vision and language, we can start to tackle the problem of generating image captions that are both visually grounded and appropriately styled. Existing approaches either require styled training captions aligned to images or generate captions with low relevance. We develop a model that learns to generate visually relevant styled captions from a large corpus of styled text without aligned images. The core idea of this model, called SemStyle, is to separate semantics and style. One key component is a novel and concise semantic term representation generated using natural language processing techniques and frame semantics. In addition, we develop a unified language model that decodes sentences with diverse word choices and syntax for different styles. Evaluations, both automatic and manual, show captions from SemStyle preserve image semantics, are descriptive, and are style shifted. More broadly, this work provides possibilities to learn richer image descriptions from the plethora of linguistic data available on the web. 
### 321.LiteFlowNet: A Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network for Optical Flow  Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07036.pdf)
> FlowNet2, the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) for optical flow estimation, requires over 160M parameters to achieve accurate flow estimation. In this paper we present an alternative network that outperforms FlowNet2 on the challenging Sintel final pass and KITTI benchmarks, while being 30 times smaller in the model size and 1.36 times faster in the running speed. This is made possible by drilling down to architectural details that might have been missed in the current frameworks: (1) We present a more effective flow inference approach at each pyramid level through a lightweight cascaded network. It not only improves flow estimation accuracy through early correction, but also permits seamless incorporation of descriptor matching in our network. (2) We present a novel flow regularization layer to ameliorate the issue of outliers and vague flow boundaries by using a feature-driven local convolution. (3) Our network owns an effective structure for pyramidal feature extraction and embraces feature warping rather than image warping as practiced in FlowNet2. Our code and trained models are available at <a href="https://github.com/twhui/LiteFlowNet">this https URL</a> . 
### 322.A Theoretical Explanation for Perplexing Behaviors of  Backpropagation-based Visualizations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07039.pdf)
> Backpropagation-based visualizations have been proposed to interpret convolutional neural networks (CNNs), however a theory is missing to justify their behaviors: Guided backpropagation (GBP) and deconvolutional network (DeconvNet) generate more human-interpretable but less class-sensitive visualizations than saliency map. Motivated by this, we develop a theoretical explanation revealing that GBP and DeconvNet are essentially doing (partial) image recovery which is unrelated to the network decisions. Specifically, our analysis shows that the backward ReLU introduced by GBP and DeconvNet, and the local connections in CNNs are the two main causes of compelling visualizations. Extensive experiments are provided that support the theoretical analysis. 
### 323.Multi-level Wavelet-CNN for Image Restoration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07071.pdf)
> The tradeoff between receptive field size and efficiency is a crucial issue in low level vision. Plain convolutional networks (CNNs) generally enlarge the receptive field at the expense of computational cost. Recently, dilated filtering has been adopted to address this issue. But it suffers from gridding effect, and the resulting receptive field is only a sparse sampling of input image with checkerboard patterns. In this paper, we present a novel multi-level wavelet CNN (MWCNN) model for better tradeoff between receptive field size and computational efficiency. With the modified U-Net architecture, wavelet transform is introduced to reduce the size of feature maps in the contracting subnetwork. Furthermore, another convolutional layer is further used to decrease the channels of feature maps. In the expanding subnetwork, inverse wavelet transform is then deployed to reconstruct the high resolution feature maps. Our MWCNN can also be explained as the generalization of dilated filtering and subsampling, and can be applied to many image restoration tasks. The experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of MWCNN for image denoising, single image super-resolution, and JPEG image artifacts removal. 
### 324.TractSeg - Fast and accurate white matter tract segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07103.pdf)
> The individual course of white matter fiber tracts is an important key for analysis of white matter characteristics in healthy and diseased brains. Uniquely, diffusion-weighted MRI tractography in combination with region-based or clustering-based selection of streamlines allows for the in-vivo delineation and analysis of anatomically well known tracts. This, however, currently requires complex, computationally intensive and tedious-to-set-up processing pipelines. TractSeg is a novel convolutional neural network-based approach that directly segments tracts in the field of fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) peaks without requiring tractography, image registration or parcellation. We demonstrate in 105 subjects from the Human Connectome Project that the proposed approach is much faster than existing methods while providing unprecedented accuracy. The code and data are openly available at <a href="https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/TractSeg/">this https URL</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1088277">this https URL</a>, respectively. 
### 325.Improving Image Captioning with Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07112.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel conditional-generative-adversarial-nets-based image captioning framework as an extension of traditional reinforcement-learning (RL)-based encoder-decoder architecture. To deal with the inconsistent evaluation problem among different objective language metrics, we are motivated to design some "discriminator" networks to automatically and progressively determine whether generated caption is human described or machine generated. Two kinds of discriminator architectures (CNN and RNN-based structures) are introduced since each has its own advantages. The proposed algorithm is generic so that it can enhance any existing RL-based image captioning framework and we show that the conventional RL training method is just a special case of our approach. Empirically, we show consistent im- provements over all language evaluation metrics for different state-of-the-art image captioning models. In addition, the well-trained discriminators can also be viewed as objective image captioning evaluators 
### 326.Recurrent knowledge distillation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07170.pdf)
> Knowledge distillation compacts deep networks by letting a small student network learn from a large teacher network. The accuracy of knowledge distillation recently benefited from adding residual layers. We propose to reduce the size of the student network even further by recasting multiple residual layers in the teacher network into a single recurrent student layer. We propose three variants of adding recurrent connections into the student network, and show experimentally on CIFAR-10, Scenes and MiniPlaces, that we can reduce the number of parameters at little loss in accuracy. 
### 327.The EuroCity Persons Dataset: A Novel Benchmark for Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07193.pdf)
> Big data has had a great share in the success of deep learning in computer vision. Recent works suggest that there is significant further potential to increase object detection performance by utilizing even bigger datasets. In this paper, we introduce the EuroCity Persons dataset, which provides a large number of highly diverse, accurate and detailed annotations of pedestrians, cyclists and other riders in urban traffic scenes. The images for this dataset were collected on-board a moving vehicle in 31 cities of 12 European countries. With over 238200 person instances manually labeled in over 47300 images, EuroCity Persons is nearly one order of magnitude larger than person datasets used previously for benchmarking. The dataset furthermore contains a large number of person orientation annotations (over 211200). We optimize four state-of-the-art deep learning approaches (Faster R-CNN, R-FCN, SSD and YOLOv3) to serve as baselines for the new object detection benchmark. In experiments with previous datasets we analyze the generalization capabilities of these detectors when trained with the new dataset. We furthermore study the effect of the training set size, the dataset diversity (day- vs. night-time, geographical region), the dataset detail (i.e. availability of object orientation information) and the annotation quality on the detector performance. Finally, we analyze error sources and discuss the road ahead. 
### 328.Recognition of Activities from Eye Gaze and Egocentric Video [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07253.pdf)
> This paper presents a framework for recognition of human activity from egocentric video and eye tracking data obtained from a head-mounted eye tracker. Three channels of information such as eye movement, ego-motion, and visual features are combined for the classification of activities. Image features were extracted using a pre-trained convolutional neural network. Eye and ego-motion are quantized, and the windowed histograms are used as the features. The combination of features obtains better accuracy for activity classification as compared to individual features.

> With the deployment of neural networks on mobile devices and the necessity of transmitting neural networks over limited or expensive channels, the file size of the trained model was identified as bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a codec for the compression of neural networks which is based on transform coding for convolutional and dense layers and on clustering for biases and normalizations. By using this codec, we achieve average compression factors between 7.9-9.3 while the accuracy of the compressed networks for image classification decreases only by 1%-2%, respectively. 
### 330.XOGAN: One-to-Many Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07277.pdf)
> Unsupervised image-to-image translation aims at learning the relationship between samples from two image domains without supervised pair information. The relationship between two domain images can be one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many. In this paper, we study the one-to-many unsupervised image translation problem in which an input sample from one domain can correspond to multiple samples in the other domain. To learn the complex relationship between the two domains, we introduce an additional variable to control the variations in our one-to-many mapping. A generative model with an XO-structure, called the XOGAN, is proposed to learn the cross domain relationship among the two domains and the ad- ditional variables. Not only can we learn to translate between the two image domains, we can also handle the translated images with additional variations. Experiments are performed on unpaired image generation tasks, including edges-to-objects translation and facial image translation. We show that the proposed XOGAN model can generate plausible images and control variations, such as color and texture, of the generated images. Moreover, while state-of-the-art unpaired image generation algorithms tend to generate images with monotonous colors, XOGAN can generate more diverse results. 
### 331.An Unsupervised Approach to Solving Inverse Problems using Generative  Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07281.pdf)
> Solving inverse problems continues to be a challenge in a wide array of applications ranging from deblurring, image inpainting, source separation etc. Most existing techniques solve such inverse problems by either explicitly or implicitly finding the inverse of the model. The former class of techniques require explicit knowledge of the measurement process which can be unrealistic, and rely on strong analytical regularizers to constrain the solution space, which often do not generalize well. The latter approaches have had remarkable success in part due to deep learning, but require a large collection of source-observation pairs, which can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised technique to solve inverse problems with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Using a pre-trained GAN in the space of source signals, we show that one can reliably recover solutions to under determined problems in a `blind' fashion, i.e., without knowledge of the measurement process. We solve this by making successive estimates on the model and the solution in an iterative fashion. We show promising results in three challenging applications -- blind source separation, image deblurring, and recovering an image from its edge map, and perform better than several baselines. 
### 332.Learning 3D Shape Completion under Weak Supervision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07290.pdf)
> We address the problem of 3D shape completion from sparse and noisy point clouds, a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics. Recent approaches are either data-driven or learning-based: Data-driven approaches rely on a shape model whose parameters are optimized to fit the observations; Learning-based approaches, in contrast, avoid the expensive optimization step by learning to directly predict complete shapes from incomplete observations in a fully-supervised setting. However, full supervision is often not available in practice. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised learning-based approach to 3D shape completion which neither requires slow optimization nor direct supervision. While we also learn a shape prior on synthetic data, we amortize, i.e., learn, maximum likelihood fitting using deep neural networks resulting in efficient shape completion without sacrificing accuracy. On synthetic benchmarks based on ShapeNet and ModelNet as well as on real robotics data from KITTI and Kinect, we demonstrate that the proposed amortized maximum likelihood approach is able to compete with the fully supervised baseline of and outperforms the data-driven approach of, while requiring less supervision and being significantly faster. 
### 333.Stop memorizing: A data-dependent regularization framework for intrinsic  pattern learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07291.pdf)
> Deep neural networks (DNNs) typically have enough capacity to fit random data by brute force even when conventional data-dependent regularizations focusing on the geometry of the features are imposed. We find out that the reason for this is the inconsistency between the enforced geometry and the standard softmax cross entropy loss. To resolve this, we propose a new framework for data-dependent DNN regularization, the Geometrically-Regularized-Self-Validating neural Networks (GRSVNet). During training, the geometry enforced on one batch of features is simultaneously validated on a separate batch using a validation loss consistent with the geometry. We study a particular case of GRSVNet, the Orthogonal-Low-rank Embedding (OLE)-GRSVNet, which is capable of producing highly discriminative features residing in orthogonal low-rank subspaces. Numerical experiments show that OLE-GRSVNet outperforms DNNs with conventional regularization when trained on real data. More importantly, unlike conventional DNNs, OLE-GRSVNet refuses to memorize random data or random labels, suggesting it only learns intrinsic patterns by reducing the memorizing capacity of the baseline DNN. 
### 334.Cross-domain attribute representation based on convolutional neural  network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07295.pdf)
> In the problem of domain transfer learning, we learn a model for the predic-tion in a target domain from the data of both some source domains and the target domain, where the target domain is in lack of labels while the source domain has sufficient labels. Besides the instances of the data, recently the attributes of data shared across domains are also explored and proven to be very helpful to leverage the information of different domains. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework for domain-transfer learning based on both instances and attributes. We proposed to embed the attributes of dif-ferent domains by a shared convolutional neural network (CNN), learn a domain-independent CNN model to represent the information shared by dif-ferent domains by matching across domains, and a domain-specific CNN model to represent the information of each domain. The concatenation of the three CNN model outputs is used to predict the class label. An iterative algo-rithm based on gradient descent method is developed to learn the parameters of the model. The experiments over benchmark datasets show the advantage of the proposed model. 
### 335.Mixup-Based Acoustic Scene Classification Using Multi-Channel  Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07319.pdf)
> Audio scene classification, the problem of predicting class labels of audio scenes, has drawn lots of attention during the last several years. However, it remains challenging and falls short of accuracy and efficiency. Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods have achieved better performance with comparison to the traditional methods. Nevertheless, conventional single channel CNN may fail to consider the fact that additional cues may be embedded in the multi-channel recordings. In this paper, we explore the use of Multi-channel CNN for the classification task, which aims to extract features from different channels in an end-to-end manner. We conduct the evaluation compared with the conventional CNN and traditional Gaussian Mixture Model-based methods. Moreover, to improve the classification accuracy further, this paper explores the using of mixup method. In brief, mixup trains the neural network on linear combinations of pairs of the representation of audio scene examples and their labels. By employing the mixup approach for data argumentation, the novel model can provide higher prediction accuracy and robustness in contrast with previous models, while the generalization error can also be reduced on the evaluation data. 
### 336.Scanner: Efficient Video Analysis at Scale [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07339.pdf)
> A growing number of visual computing applications depend on the analysis of large video collections. The challenge is that scaling applications to operate on these datasets requires efficient systems for pixel data access and parallel processing across large numbers of machines. Few programmers have the capability to operate efficiently at these scales, limiting the field's ability to explore new applications that leverage big video data. In response, we have created Scanner, a system for productive and efficient video analysis at scale. Scanner organizes video collections as tables in a data store optimized for sampling frames from compressed video, and executes pixel processing computations, expressed as dataflow graphs, on these frames. Scanner schedules video analysis applications expressed using these abstractions onto heterogeneous throughput computing hardware, such as multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and media processing ASICs, for high-throughput pixel processing. We demonstrate the productivity of Scanner by authoring a variety of video processing applications including the synthesis of stereo VR video streams from multi-camera rigs, markerless 3D human pose reconstruction from video, and data-mining big video datasets such as hundreds of feature-length films or over 70,000 hours of TV news. These applications achieve near-expert performance on a single machine and scale efficiently to hundreds of machines, enabling formerly long-running big video data analysis tasks to be carried out in minutes to hours. 
### 337.Batch Normalization in the final layer of generative networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07389.pdf)
> Generative Networks have shown great promise in generating photo-realistic images. Despite this, the theory surrounding them is still an active research area. Much of the useful work with Generative networks rely on heuristics that tend to produce good results. One of these heuristics is the advice not to use Batch Normalization in the final layer of the generator network. Many of the state-of-the-art generative network architectures use this heuristic, but the reasons for doing so are inconsistent. This paper will show that this is not necessarily a good heuristic and that Batch Normalization can be beneficial in the final layer of the generator network either by placing it before the final non-linear activation, usually a $tanh$ or replacing the final $tanh$ activation altogether with Batch Normalization and clipping. We show that this can lead to the faster training of Generator networks by matching the generator to the mean and standard deviation of the target distribution's image colour values. 
### 338.Incept-N: A Convolutional Neural Network based Classification Approach  for Predicting Nationality from Facial Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07426.pdf)
> The nationality of a human being is a well-known identifying characteristic used for every major authentication purpose in every country. Albeit advances in the application of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision in different aspects, its contribution to this specific security procedure is yet to be cultivated. With a goal to successfully applying computer vision techniques to predict the nationality of a person based on his facial features, we have proposed this novel method and have achieved an average of 93.6% accuracy with very low misclassification rate. 
### 339.My camera can see through fences: A deep learning approach for image  de-fencing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07442.pdf)
> In recent times, the availability of inexpensive image capturing devices such as smartphones/tablets has led to an exponential increase in the number of images/videos captured. However, sometimes the amateur photographer is hindered by fences in the scene which have to be removed after the image has been captured. Conventional approaches to image de-fencing suffer from inaccurate and non-robust fence detection apart from being limited to processing images of only static occluded scenes. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated de-fencing algorithm using a video of the dynamic scene. We use convolutional neural networks for detecting fence pixels. We provide qualitative as well as quantitative comparison results with existing lattice detection algorithms on the existing PSU NRT data set and a proposed challenging fenced image dataset. The inverse problem of fence removal is solved using split Bregman technique assuming total variation of the de-fenced image as the regularization constraint. 
### 340.Adversarial Structure Matching Loss for Image Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07457.pdf)
> The per-pixel cross-entropy loss (CEL) has been widely used in structured output prediction tasks as a spatial extension of generic image classification. However, its i.i.d. assumption neglects the structural regularity present in natural images. Various attempts have been made to incorporate structural reasoning mostly through structure priors in a cooperative way where co-occuring patterns are encouraged. We, on the other hand, approach this problem from an opposing angle and propose a new framework for training such structured prediction networks via an adversarial process, in which we train a structure analyzer that provides the supervisory signals, the adversarial structure matching loss (ASML). The structure analyzer is trained to maximize ASML, or to exaggerate recurring structural mistakes usually among co-occurring patterns. On the contrary, the structured output prediction network is trained to reduce those mistakes and is thus enabled to distinguish fine-grained structures. As a result, training structured output prediction networks using ASML reduces contextual confusion among objects and improves boundary localization. We demonstrate that ASML outperforms its counterpart CEL especially in context and boundary aspects on figure-ground segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks with various base architectures, such as FCN, U-Net, DeepLab, and PSPNet. 
### 341.Unsupervised Learning of Neural Networks to Explain Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07468.pdf)
> This paper presents an unsupervised method to learn a neural network, namely an explainer, to interpret a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), i.e., explaining knowledge representations hidden in middle conv-layers of the CNN. Given feature maps of a certain conv-layer of the CNN, the explainer performs like an auto-encoder, which first disentangles the feature maps into object-part features and then inverts object-part features back to features of higher conv-layers of the CNN. More specifically, the explainer contains interpretable conv-layers, where each filter disentangles the representation of a specific object part from chaotic input feature maps. As a paraphrase of CNN features, the disentangled representations of object parts help people understand the logic inside the CNN. We also learn the explainer to use object-part features to reconstruct features of higher CNN layers, in order to minimize loss of information during the feature disentanglement. More crucially, we learn the explainer via network distillation without using any annotations of sample labels, object parts, or textures for supervision. We have applied our method to different types of CNNs for evaluation, and explainers have significantly boosted the interpretability of CNN features. 
### 342.Norm-Preservation: Why Residual Networks Can Become Extremely Deep? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07477.pdf)
> Augmenting deep neural networks with skip connections, as introduced in the so called ResNet architecture, surprised the community by enabling the training of networks of more than 1000 layers with significant performance gains. It has been shown that identity skip connections eliminate singularities and improve the optimization landscape of the network. <br />This paper deciphers ResNet by analyzing the of effect of skip connections in the backward path and sets forth new theoretical results on the advantages of identity skip connections in deep neural networks. We prove that the skip connections in the residual blocks facilitate preserving the norm of the gradient and lead to well-behaved and stable back-propagation, which is a desirable feature from optimization perspective. We also show that, perhaps surprisingly, as more residual blocks are stacked, the network becomes more norm-preserving. Traditionally, norm-preservation is enforced on the network only at beginning of the training, by using initialization techniques. However, we show that identity skip connection retain norm-preservation during the training procedure. Our theoretical arguments are supported by extensive empirical evidence. <br />Can we push for more norm-preservation? We answer this question by proposing zero-phase whitening of the fully-connected layer and adding norm-preserving transition layers. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the learning dynamics and the performance of ResNets can be improved by making it even more norm preserving through changing only a few blocks in very deep residual networks. Our results and the introduced modification for ResNet, referred to as Procrustes ResNets, can be used as a guide for studying more complex architectures such as DenseNet, training deeper networks, and inspiring new architectures. 
### 343.Fast Disparity Estimation using Dense Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07499.pdf)
> Disparity estimation is a difficult problem in stereo vision because the correspondence technique fails in images with textureless and repetitive regions. Recent body of work using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) overcomes this problem with semantics. Most CNN implementations use an autoencoder method; stereo images are encoded, merged and finally decoded to predict the disparity map. In this paper, we present a CNN implementation inspired by dense networks to reduce the number of parameters. Furthermore, our approach takes into account semantic reasoning in disparity estimation. Our proposed network, called DenseMapNet, is compact, fast and can be trained end-to-end. DenseMapNet requires 290k parameters only and runs at 30Hz or faster on color stereo images in full resolution. Experimental results show that DenseMapNet accuracy is comparable with other significantly bigger CNN-based methods. 
### 344.Sparsely Grouped Multi-task Generative Adversarial Networks for Facial  Attribute Manipulation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07509.pdf)
> Recently, Image-to-Image Translation (IIT) has achieved great progress in image style transfer and semantic context manipulation for images. However, existing approaches require exhaustively labelling training data, which is labor demanding, difficult to scale up, and hard to adapt to a new domain. To overcome such a key limitation, we propose Sparsely Grouped Generative Adversarial Networks (SG-GAN) as a novel approach that can translate images in sparsely grouped datasets where only a few train samples are labelled. Using a one-input multi-output architecture, SG-GAN is well-suited for tackling multi-task learning and sparsely grouped learning tasks. The new model is able to translate images among multiple groups using only a single trained model. To experimentally validate the advantages of the new model, we apply the proposed method to tackle a series of attribute manipulation tasks for facial images as a case study. Experimental results show that SG-GAN can achieve comparable results with state-of-the-art methods on adequately labelled datasets while attaining a superior image translation quality on sparsely grouped datasets. 
### 345.Deep Predictive Coding Network with Local Recurrent Processing for  Object Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07526.pdf)
> Inspired by "predictive coding" - a theory in neuroscience, we develop a bi-directional and dynamical neural network with local recurrent processing, namely predictive coding network (PCN). Unlike any feedforward-only convolutional neural network, PCN includes both feedback connections, which carry top-down predictions, and feedforward connections, which carry bottom-up errors of prediction. Feedback and feedforward connections enable adjacent layers to interact locally and recurrently to refine representations towards minimization of layer-wise prediction errors. When unfolded over time, the recurrent processing gives rise to an increasingly deeper hierarchy of non-linear transformation, allowing a shallow network to dynamically extend itself into an arbitrarily deep network. We train and test PCN for image classification with SVHN, CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. Despite notably fewer layers and parameters, PCN achieves competitive performance compared to classical and state-of-the-art models. Further analysis shows that the internal representations in PCN converge over time and yield increasingly better accuracy in object recognition. Errors of top-down prediction also map visual saliency or bottom-up attention. This work takes us one step closer to bridging human and machine intelligence in vision. 
### 346.Two-stage quality adaptive fingerprint image enhancement using Fuzzy  c-means clustering based fingerprint quality analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07527.pdf)
> Fingerprint recognition techniques are immensely dependent on quality of the fingerprint images. To improve the performance of recognition algorithm for poor quality images an efficient enhancement algorithm should be designed. Performance improvement of recognition algorithm will be more if enhancement process is adaptive to the fingerprint quality (wet, dry or normal). In this paper, a quality adaptive fingerprint enhancement algorithm is proposed. The proposed fingerprint quality assessment algorithm clusters the fingerprint images in appropriate quality class of dry, wet, normal dry, normal wet and good quality using fuzzy c-means technique. It considers seven features namely, mean, moisture, variance, uniformity, contrast, ridge valley area uniformity and ridge valley uniformity into account for clustering the fingerprint images in appropriate quality class. Fingerprint images of each quality class undergo through a two-stage fingerprint quality enhancement process. A quality adaptive preprocessing method is used as front-end before enhancing the fingerprint images with Gabor, short term Fourier transform and oriented diffusion filtering based enhancement techniques. Experimental results show improvement in the verification results for FVC2004 datasets. Significant improvement in equal error rate is observed while using quality adaptive preprocessing based approaches in comparison to the current state-of-the-art enhancement techniques. 
### 347.End-to-end driving simulation via angle branched network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07545.pdf)
> Imitation learning for end-to-end autonomous driving has drawn attention from academic communities. Current methods either only use images as the input which is ambiguous when a car approaches an intersection, or use additional command information to navigate the vehicle but not automated enough. Focusing on making the vehicle drive along the given path, we propose a new navigation command that does not require human's participation and a novel model architecture called angle branched network. Both the new navigation command and the angle branched network are easy to understand and effective. Besides, we find that not only segmentation information but also depth information can boost the performance of the driving model. We conduct experiments in a 3D urban simulator and both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results show the effectiveness of our model. 
### 348.Learning Pixel-wise Labeling from the Internet without Human Interaction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07548.pdf)
> Deep learning stands at the forefront in many computer vision tasks. However, deep neural networks are usually data-hungry and require a huge amount of well-annotated training samples. Collecting sufficient annotated data is very expensive in many applications, especially for pixel-level prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. To solve this fundamental issue, we consider a new challenging vision task, Internetly supervised semantic segmentation, which only uses Internet data with noisy image-level supervision of corresponding query keywords for segmentation model training. We address this task by proposing the following solution. A class-specific attention model unifying multiscale forward and backward convolutional features is proposed to provide initial segmentation "ground truth". The model trained with such noisy annotations is then improved by an online fine-tuning procedure. It achieves state-of-the-art performance under the weakly-supervised setting on PASCAL VOC2012 dataset. The proposed framework also paves a new way towards learning from the Internet without human interaction and could serve as a strong baseline therein. Code and data will be released upon the paper acceptance. 
### 349.Disc-aware Ensemble Network for Glaucoma Screening from Fundus Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07549.pdf)
> Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease that leads to irreversible vision loss. Most of the existing automatic screening methods firstly segment the main structure, and subsequently calculate the clinical measurement for detection and screening of glaucoma. However, these measurement-based methods rely heavily on the segmentation accuracy, and ignore various visual features. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning technique to gain additional image-relevant information, and screen glaucoma from the fundus image directly. Specifically, a novel Disc-aware Ensemble Network (DENet) for automatic glaucoma screening is proposed, which integrates the deep hierarchical context of the global fundus image and the local optic disc region. Four deep streams on different levels and modules are respectively considered as global image stream, segmentation-guided network, local disc region stream, and disc polar transformation stream. Finally, the output probabilities of different streams are fused as the final screening result. The experiments on two glaucoma datasets (SCES and new SINDI datasets) show our method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms. 
### 350.DenseImage Network: Video Spatial-Temporal Evolution Encoding and  Understanding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07550.pdf)
> Many of the leading approaches for video understanding are data-hungry and time-consuming, failing to capture the gist of spatial-temporal evolution in an efficient manner. The latest research shows that CNN network can reason about static relation of entities in images. To further exploit its capacity in dynamic evolution reasoning, we introduce a novel network module called DenseImage Network(DIN) with two main contributions. 1) A novel compact representation of video which distills its significant spatial-temporal evolution into a matrix called DenseImage, primed for efficient video encoding. 2) A simple yet powerful learning strategy based on DenseImage and a temporal-order-preserving CNN network is proposed for video understanding, which contains a local temporal correlation constraint capturing temporal evolution at multiple time scales with different filter widths. Extensive experiments on two recent challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DenseImage Network can accurately capture the common spatial-temporal evolution between similar actions, even with enormous visual variations or different time scales. Moreover, we obtain the state-of-the-art results in action and gesture recognition with much less time-and-memory cost, indicating its immense potential in video representing and understanding. 
### 351.Wildest Faces: Face Detection and Recognition in Violent Settings [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07566.pdf)
> With the introduction of large-scale datasets and deep learning models capable of learning complex representations, impressive advances have emerged in face detection and recognition tasks. Despite such advances, existing datasets do not capture the difficulty of face recognition in the wildest scenarios, such as hostile disputes or fights. Furthermore, existing datasets do not represent completely unconstrained cases of low resolution, high blur and large pose/occlusion variances. To this end, we introduce the Wildest Faces dataset, which focuses on such adverse effects through violent scenes. The dataset consists of an extensive set of violent scenes of celebrities from movies. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art techniques are not well-suited for violent scenes, and therefore, Wildest Faces is likely to stir further interest in face detection and recognition research. 
### 352.Optimizing the F-measure for Threshold-free Salient Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07567.pdf)
> Current CNN-based solutions to salient object detection (SOD) mainly rely on the optimization of cross-entropy loss (CELoss). Then the quality of detected saliency maps is often evaluated in terms of F-measure. In this paper, we investigate an interesting issue: can we consistently use the F-measure formulation in both training and evaluation for SOD? By reformulating the standard F-measure we propose the relaxed F-measure which is differentiable w.r.t the posterior and can be easily appended to the back of CNNs as the loss function. Compared to the conventional cross-entropy loss of which the gradients decrease dramatically in the saturated area, our loss function, named FLoss, holds considerable gradients even when the activation approaches the target. Consequently, the FLoss can continuously force the network to produce polarized activations. Comprehensive benchmarks on several popular datasets show that FLoss outperforms the state- of-the-arts with a considerable margin. More specifically, due to the polarized predictions, our method is able to obtain high quality saliency maps without carefully tuning the optimal threshold, showing significant advantages in real world applications. 
### 353.Fast Object Classification in Single-pixel Imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07582.pdf)
> In single-pixel imaging (SPI), the target object is illuminated with varying patterns sequentially and an intensity sequence is recorded by a single-pixel detector without spatial resolution. A high quality object image can only be computationally reconstructed after a large number of illuminations, with disadvantages of long imaging time and high cost. Conventionally, object classification is performed after a reconstructed object image with good fidelity is available. In this paper, we propose to classify the target object with a small number of illuminations in a fast manner for Fourier SPI. A naive Bayes classifier is employed to classify the target objects based on the single-pixel intensity sequence without any image reconstruction and each sequence element is regarded as an object feature in the classifier. Simulation results demonstrate our proposed scheme can classify the number digit object images with high accuracy (e.g. 80% accuracy using only 13 illuminations, at a sampling ratio of 0.3%). 
### 354.Generative Creativity: Adversarial Learning for Bionic Design [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07615.pdf)
> Bionic design refers to an approach of generative creativity in which a target object (e.g. a floor lamp) is designed to contain features of biological source objects (e.g. flowers), resulting in creative biologically-inspired design. In this work, we attempt to model the process of shape-oriented bionic design as follows: given an input image of a design target object, the model generates images that 1) maintain shape features of the input design target image, 2) contain shape features of images from the specified biological source domain, 3) are plausible and diverse. We propose DesignGAN, a novel unsupervised deep generative approach to realising bionic design. Specifically, we employ a conditional Generative Adversarial Networks architecture with several designated losses (an adversarial loss, a regression loss, a cycle loss and a latent loss) that respectively constrict our model to meet the corresponding aforementioned requirements of bionic design modelling. We perform qualitative and quantitative experiments to evaluate our method, and demonstrate that our proposed approach successfully generates creative images of bionic design. 
### 355.CapProNet: Deep Feature Learning via Orthogonal Projections onto Capsule  Subspaces [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07621.pdf)
> In this paper, we formalize the idea behind capsule nets of using a capsule vector rather than a neuron activation to predict the label of samples. To this end, we propose to learn a group of capsule subspaces onto which an input feature vector is projected. Then the lengths of resultant capsules are used to score the probability of belonging to different classes. We train such a Capsule Projection Network (CapProNet) by learning an orthogonal projection matrix for each capsule subspace, and show that each capsule subspace is updated until it contains input feature vectors corresponding to the associated class. Only a small negligible computing overhead is incurred to train the network in low-dimensional capsule subspaces or through an alternative hyper-power iteration to estimate the normalization matrix. Experiment results on image datasets show the presented model can greatly improve the performance of state-of-the-art ResNet backbones by $10-20\%$ at the same level of computing and memory costs. 
### 356.Latent Space Non-Linear Statistics [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07632.pdf)
> Given data, deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), train a lower dimensional latent representation of the data space. The linear Euclidean geometry of data space pulls back to a nonlinear Riemannian geometry on the latent space. The latent space thus provides a low-dimensional nonlinear representation of data and classical linear statistical techniques are no longer applicable. In this paper we show how statistics of data in their latent space representation can be performed using techniques from the field of nonlinear manifold statistics. Nonlinear manifold statistics provide generalizations of Euclidean statistical notions including means, principal component analysis, and maximum likelihood fits of parametric probability distributions. We develop new techniques for maximum likelihood inference in latent space, and adress the computational complexity of using geometric algorithms with high-dimensional data by training a separate neural network to approximate the Riemannian metric and cometric tensor capturing the shape of the learned data manifold. 
### 357.Learning Sampling Policies for Domain Adaptation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07641.pdf)
> We address the problem of semi-supervised domain adaptation of classification algorithms through deep Q-learning. The core idea is to consider the predictions of a source domain network on target domain data as noisy labels, and learn a policy to sample from this data so as to maximize classification accuracy on a small annotated reward partition of the target domain. Our experiments show that learned sampling policies construct labeled sets that improve accuracies of visual classifiers over baselines. 
### 358.Capturing human category representations by sampling in deep feature  spaces [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07644.pdf)
> Understanding how people represent categories is a core problem in cognitive science. Decades of research have yielded a variety of formal theories of categories, but validating them with naturalistic stimuli is difficult. The challenge is that human category representations cannot be directly observed and running informative experiments with naturalistic stimuli such as images requires a workable representation of these stimuli. Deep neural networks have recently been successful in solving a range of computer vision tasks and provide a way to compactly represent image features. Here, we introduce a method to estimate the structure of human categories that combines ideas from cognitive science and machine learning, blending human-based algorithms with state-of-the-art deep image generators. We provide qualitative and quantitative results as a proof-of-concept for the method's feasibility. Samples drawn from human distributions rival those from state-of-the-art generative models in quality and outperform alternative methods for estimating the structure of human categories. 
### 359.Long-term face tracking in the wild using deep learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07646.pdf)
> This paper investigates long-term face tracking of a specific person given his/her face image in a single frame as a query in a video stream. Through taking advantage of pre-trained deep learning models on big data, a novel system is developed for accurate video face tracking in the unconstrained environments depicting various people and objects moving in and out of the frame. In the proposed system, we present a detection-verification-tracking method (dubbed as 'DVT') which accomplishes the long-term face tracking task through the collaboration of face detection, face verification, and (short-term) face tracking. An offline trained detector based on cascaded convolutional neural networks localizes all faces appeared in the frames, and an offline trained face verifier based on deep convolutional neural networks and similarity metric learning decides if any face or which face corresponds to the queried person. An online trained tracker follows the face from frame to frame. When validated on a sitcom episode and a TV show, the DVT method outperforms tracking-learning-detection (TLD) and face-TLD in terms of recall and precision. The proposed system is also tested on many other types of videos and shows very promising results. 
### 360.Learning Hierarchical Visual Representations in Deep Neural Networks  Using Hierarchical Linguistic Labels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07647.pdf)
> Modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to achieve human-level object classification accuracy on specific tasks, and currently outperform competing models in explaining complex human visual representations. However, the categorization problem is posed differently for these networks than for humans: the accuracy of these networks is evaluated by their ability to identify single labels assigned to each image. These labels often cut arbitrarily across natural psychological taxonomies (e.g., dogs are separated into breeds, but never jointly categorized as "dogs"), and bias the resulting representations. By contrast, it is common for children to hear both "dog" and "Dalmatian" to describe the same stimulus, helping to group perceptually disparate objects (e.g., breeds) into a common mental class. In this work, we train CNN classifiers with multiple labels for each image that correspond to different levels of abstraction, and use this framework to reproduce classic patterns that appear in human generalization behavior. 
### 361.On Attention Models for Human Activity Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07648.pdf)
> Most approaches that model time-series data in human activity recognition based on body-worn sensing (HAR) use a fixed size temporal context to represent different activities. This might, however, not be apt for sets of activities with individ- ually varying durations. We introduce attention models into HAR research as a data driven approach for exploring relevant temporal context. Attention models learn a set of weights over input data, which we leverage to weight the temporal context being considered to model each sensor reading. We construct attention models for HAR by adding attention layers to a state- of-the-art deep learning HAR model (DeepConvLSTM) and evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets achieving sig- nificant increase in performance. Finally, we visualize the learned weights to better understand what constitutes relevant temporal context. 
### 362.Learning a face space for experiments on human identity [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07653.pdf)
> Generative models of human identity and appearance have broad applicability to behavioral science and technology, but the exquisite sensitivity of human face perception means that their utility hinges on the alignment of the model's representation to human psychological representations and the photorealism of the generated images. Meeting these requirements is an exacting task, and existing models of human identity and appearance are often unworkably abstract, artificial, uncanny, or biased. Here, we use a variational autoencoder with an autoregressive decoder to learn a face space from a uniquely diverse dataset of portraits that control much of the variation irrelevant to human identity and appearance. Our method generates photorealistic portraits of fictive identities with a smooth, navigable latent space. We validate our model's alignment with human sensitivities by introducing a psychophysical Turing test for images, which humans mostly fail. Lastly, we demonstrate an initial application of our model to the problem of fast search in mental space to obtain detailed "police sketches" in a small number of trials. 
### 363.An Evaluation of Trajectory Prediction Approaches and Notes on the  TrajNet Benchmark [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07663.pdf)
> In recent years, there is a shift from modeling the tracking problem based on Bayesian formulation towards using deep neural networks. Towards this end, in this paper the effectiveness of various deep neural networks for predicting future pedestrian paths are evaluated. The analyzed deep networks solely rely, like in the traditional approaches, on observed tracklets without human-human interaction information. The evaluation is done on the publicly available TrajNet benchmark dataset, which builds up a repository of considerable and popular datasets for trajectory-based activity forecasting. We show that a Recurrent-Encoder with a Dense layer stacked on top, referred to as RED-predictor, is able to achieve sophisticated results compared to elaborated models in such scenarios. Further, we investigate failure cases and give explanations for observed phenomena and give some recommendations for overcoming demonstrated shortcomings. 
### 364.Non-Local Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07694.pdf)
> Traditional deep methods for skeleton-based action recognition usually structure the skeleton as a coordinates sequence or a pseudo-image to feed to RNNs or CNNs, which cannot explicitly exploit the natural connectivity among the joints. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which generalize CNNs to more generic non-Euclidean structures, obtains remarkable performance for skeleton-based action recognition. However, the topology of the graph is set by hand and fixed over all layers, which may be not optimal for the action recognition task and the hierarchical CNN structures. Besides, the first-order information (the coordinate of joints) is mainly used in former GCNs, while the second-order information (the length and direction of bones) is less exploited. In this work, a novel two-stream nonlocal graph convolutional network is proposed to solve these problems. The topology of the graph in each layer of the model can be either uniformly or individually learned by BP algorithm, which brings more flexibility and generality. Meanwhile, a two-stream framework is proposed to model both of the joints and bones information simultaneously, which further boost the recognition performance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, NTU-RGB+D and Kinetics, demonstrate the performance of our model exceeds the state-of-the-art by a significant margin. 
### 365.RGB-Depth SLAM Review [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07696.pdf)
> Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have made the real-time dense reconstruction possible increasing the prospects of navigation, tracking, and augmented reality problems. Some breakthroughs have been achieved in this regard during past few decades and more remarkable works are still going on. This paper presents an overview of SLAM approaches that have been developed till now. Kinect Fusion algorithm, its variants, and further developed approaches are discussed in detailed. The algorithms and approaches are compared for their effectiveness in tracking and mapping based on Root Mean Square error over online available datasets. 
### 366.Density-Adaptive Kernel based Re-Ranking for Person Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07698.pdf)
> Person Re-Identification (ReID) refers to the task of verifying the identity of a pedestrian observed from non-overlapping surveillance cameras views. Recently, it has been validated that re-ranking could bring extra performance improvements in person ReID. However, the current re-ranking approaches either require feedbacks from users or suffer from burdensome computation cost. In this paper, we propose to exploit a density-adaptive kernel technique to perform efficient and effective re-ranking for person ReID. Specifically, we present two simple yet effective re-ranking methods, termed inverse Density-Adaptive Kernel based Re-ranking (inv-DAKR) and bidirectional Density-Adaptive Kernel based Re-ranking (bi-DAKR), which are based on a smooth kernel function with a density-adaptive parameter. Experiments on six benchmark data sets confirm that our proposals are effective and efficient. 
### 367.Object Localization and Motion Transfer learning with Capsules [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07706.pdf)
> Inspired by CapsNet's routing-by-agreement mechanism, with its ability to learn object properties, and by center-of-mass calculations from physics, we propose a CapsNet architecture with object coordinate atoms and an LSTM network for evaluation. The first is based on CapsNet but uses a new routing algorithm to find the objects' approximate positions in the image coordinate system, and the second is a parameterized affine transformation network that can predict future positions from past positions by learning the translation transformation from 2D object coordinates generated from the first network. We demonstrate the learned translation transformation is transferable to another dataset without the need to train the transformation network again. Only the CapsNet needs training on the new dataset. As a result, our work shows that object recognition and motion prediction can be separated, and that motion prediction can be transferred to another dataset with different object types. 
### 368.Dynamically Unfolding Recurrent Restorer: A Moving Endpoint Control  Method for Image Restoration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07709.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a new control framework called the moving endpoint control to restore images corrupted by different degradation levels in one model. The proposed control problem contains a restoration dynamics which is modeled by an RNN. The moving endpoint, which is essentially the terminal time of the associated dynamics, is determined by a policy network. We call the proposed model the dynamically unfolding recurrent restorer (DURR). Numerical experiments show that DURR is able to achieve state-of-the-art performances on blind image denoising and JPEG image deblocking. Furthermore, DURR can well generalize to images with higher degradation levels that are not included in the training stage. 
### 369.A Deep Structure of Person Re-Identification using Multi-Level Gaussian  Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07720.pdf)
> Person re-identification is being widely used in the forensic, and security and surveillance system, but person re-identification is a challenging task in real life scenario. Hence, in this work, a new feature descriptor model has been proposed using a multilayer framework of Gaussian distribution model on pixel features, which include color moments, color space values and Schmid filter responses. An image of a person usually consists of distinct body regions, usually with differentiable clothing followed by local colors and texture patterns. Thus, the image is evaluated locally by dividing the image into overlapping regions. Each region is further fragmented into a set of local Gaussians on small patches. A global Gaussian encodes, these local Gaussians for each region creating a multi-level structure. Hence, the global picture of a person is described by local level information present in it, which is often ignored. Also, we have analyzed the efficiency of earlier metric learning methods on this descriptor. The performance of the descriptor is evaluated on four public available challenging datasets and the highest accuracy achieved on these datasets are compared with similar state-of-the-arts, which demonstrate the superior performance. 
### 370.STS Classification with Dual-stream CNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07740.pdf)
> The structured time series (STS) classification problem requires the modeling of interweaved spatiotemporal dependency. most previous STS classification methods model the spatial and temporal dependencies independently. Due to the complexity of the STS data, we argue that a desirable STS classification method should be a holistic framework that can be made as adaptive and flexible as possible. This motivates us to design a deep neural network with such merits. Inspired by the dual-stream hypothesis in neural science, we propose a novel dual-stream framework for modeling the interweaved spatiotemporal dependency, and develop a convolutional neural network within this framework that aims to achieve high adaptability and flexibility in STS configurations from various diagonals, i.e., sequential order, dependency range and features. The proposed architecture is highly modularized and scalable, making it easy to be adapted to specific tasks. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through experiments on synthetic data as well as benchmark datasets for skeleton based activity recognition. 
### 371.DLBI: Deep learning guided Bayesian inference for structure  reconstruction of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07777.pdf)
> Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, with a resolution beyond the diffraction limit of light, has become an indispensable tool to directly visualize biological structures in living cells at a nanometer-scale resolution. Despite advances in high-density super-resolution fluorescent techniques, existing methods still have bottlenecks, including extremely long execution time, artificial thinning and thickening of structures, and lack of ability to capture latent structures. Here we propose a novel deep learning guided Bayesian inference approach, DLBI, for the time-series analysis of high-density fluorescent images. Our method combines the strength of deep learning and statistical inference, where deep learning captures the underlying distribution of the fluorophores that are consistent with the observed time-series fluorescent images by exploring local features and correlation along time-axis, and statistical inference further refines the ultrastructure extracted by deep learning and endues physical meaning to the final image. Comprehensive experimental results on both real and simulated datasets demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and realistic local patch and large-field reconstruction than the state-of-the-art method, the 3B analysis, while our method is more than two orders of magnitude faster. The main program is available at <a href="https://github.com/lykaust15/DLBI">this https URL</a> 
### 372.Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation for Deep Reinforcement Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07780.pdf)
> We present a new technique for deep reinforcement learning that automatically detects moving objects and uses the relevant information for action selection. The detection of moving objects is done in an unsupervised way by exploiting structure from motion. Instead of directly learning a policy from raw images, the agent first learns to detect and segment moving objects by exploiting flow information in video sequences. The learned representation is then used to focus the policy of the agent on the moving objects. Over time, the agent identifies which objects are critical for decision making and gradually builds a policy based on relevant moving objects. This approach, which we call Motion-Oriented REinforcement Learning (MOREL), is demonstrated on a suite of Atari games where the ability to detect moving objects reduces the amount of interaction needed with the environment to obtain a good policy. Furthermore, the resulting policy is more interpretable than policies that directly map images to actions or values with a black box neural network. We can gain insight into the policy by inspecting the segmentation and motion of each object detected by the agent. This allows practitioners to confirm whether a policy is making decisions based on sensible information. 
### 373.Spherical Convolutional Neural Network for 3D Point Clouds [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07872.pdf)
> We propose a neural network for 3D point cloud processing that exploits `spherical' convolution kernels and octree partitioning of space. The proposed metric-based spherical kernels systematically quantize point neighborhoods to identify local geometric structures in data, while maintaining the properties of translation-invariance and asymmetry. The network architecture itself is guided by octree data structuring that takes full advantage of the sparse nature of irregular point clouds. We specify spherical kernels with the help of neurons in each layer that in turn are associated with spatial locations. We exploit this association to avert dynamic kernel generation during network training, that enables efficient learning with high resolution point clouds. We demonstrate the utility of the spherical convolutional neural network for 3D object classification on standard benchmark datasets. 
### 374.DeepPhys: Video-Based Physiological Measurement Using Convolutional  Attention Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07888.pdf)
> Non-contact video-based physiological measurement has many applications in health care and human-computer interaction. Practical applications require measurements to be accurate even in the presence of large head rotations. We propose the first end-to-end system for video-based measurement of heart and breathing rate using a deep convolutional network. The system features a new motion representation based on a skin reflection model and a new attention mechanism using appearance information to guide motion estimation, both of which enable robust measurement under heterogeneous lighting and major motions. Our approach significantly outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods on both RGB and infrared video datasets. Furthermore, it allows spatial-temporal distributions of physiological signals to be visualized via the attention mechanism. 
### 375.Unsupervised Deep Context Prediction for Background Foreground  Separation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07903.pdf)
> In many advanced video based applications background modeling is a pre-processing step to eliminate redundant data, for instance in tracking or video surveillance applications. Over the past years background subtraction is usually based on low level or hand-crafted features such as raw color components, gradients, or local binary patterns. The background subtraction algorithms performance suffer in the presence of various challenges such as dynamic backgrounds, photometric variations, camera jitters, and shadows. To handle these challenges for the purpose of accurate background modeling we propose a unified framework based on the algorithm of image inpainting. It is an unsupervised visual feature learning hybrid Generative Adversarial algorithm based on context prediction. We have also presented the solution of random region inpainting by the fusion of center region inpaiting and random region inpainting with the help of poisson blending technique. Furthermore we also evaluated foreground object detection with the fusion of our proposed method and morphological operations. The comparison of our proposed method with 12 state-of-the-art methods shows its stability in the application of background estimation and foreground detection. 
### 376.Class Representative Autoencoder for Low Resolution Multi-Spectral  Gender Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07905.pdf)
> Gender is one of the most common attributes used to describe an individual. It is used in multiple domains such as human computer interaction, marketing, security, and demographic reports. Research has been performed to automate the task of gender recognition in constrained environment using face images, however, limited attention has been given to gender classification in unconstrained scenarios. This work attempts to address the challenging problem of gender classification in multi-spectral low resolution face images. We propose a robust Class Representative Autoencoder model, termed as AutoGen for the same. The proposed model aims to minimize the intra-class variations while maximizing the inter-class variations for the learned feature representations. Results on visible as well as near infrared spectrum data for different resolutions and multiple databases depict the efficacy of the proposed model. Comparative results with existing approaches and two commercial off-the-shelf systems further motivate the use of class representative features for classification. 
### 377.Multi-View Stereo with Asymmetric Checkerboard Propagation and  Multi-Hypothesis Joint View Selection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07920.pdf)
> In computer vision domain, how to fast and accurately perform multiview stereo (MVS) is still a challenging problem. In this paper we present a fast yet accurate method for 3D dense reconstruction, called AMHMVS, built on the PatchMatch based stereo algorithm. Different from the regular symmetric propagation scheme, our approach adopts an asymmetric checkerboard propagation strategy, which can adaptively make effective hypotheses expand further according to the confidence of current neighbor hypotheses. In order to aggregate visual information from multiple images better, we propose the multi-hypothesis joint view selection for each pixel, which leverages a cost matrix based on the multiple propagated hypotheses to robustly infer an appropriate aggregation subset parallel. Combined with the above two steps, our approach not only has the capacity of massively parallel computation, but also obtains high accuracy and completeness. Experiments on extensive datasets show that our method achieves more accurate and robust results, and runs faster than the competing methods. 
### 378.Batch-Instance Normalization for Adaptively Style-Invariant Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07925.pdf)
> Real-world image recognition is often challenged by the variability of visual styles including object textures, lighting conditions, filter effects, etc. Although these variations have been deemed to be implicitly handled by more training data and deeper networks, recent advances in image style transfer suggest that it is also possible to explicitly manipulate the style information. Extending this idea to general visual recognition problems, we present Batch-Instance Normalization (BIN) to explicitly normalize unnecessary styles from images. Considering certain style features play an essential role in discriminative tasks, BIN learns to selectively normalize only disturbing styles while preserving useful styles. The proposed normalization module is easily incorporated into existing network architectures such as Residual Networks, and surprisingly improves the recognition performance in various scenarios. Furthermore, experiments verify that BIN effectively adapts to completely different tasks like object classification and style transfer, by controlling the trade-off between preserving and removing style variations. 
### 379.Event-based Convolutional Networks for Object Detection in Neuromorphic  Cameras [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07931.pdf)
> Event-based cameras are bioinspired sensors able to perceive changes in the scene at high frequency with a low power consumption. Becoming available only very recently, a limited amount of work addresses object detection on these devices. In this paper we propose two neural networks architectures for object detection: YOLE, which integrates the events into frames and uses a frame-based model to process them, eFCN, a event-based fully convolutional network that uses a novel and general formalization of the convolutional and max pooling layers to exploit the sparsity of the camera events. We evaluated the algorithm with different extension of publicly available dataset, and on a novel custom dataset. 
### 380.Bilinear Attention Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07932.pdf)
> Attention networks in multimodal learning provide an efficient way to utilize given visual information selectively. However, the computational cost to learn attention distributions for every pair of multimodal input channels is prohibitively expensive. To solve this problem, co-attention builds two separate attention distributions for each modality neglecting the interaction between multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose bilinear attention networks (BAN) that find bilinear attention distributions to utilize given vision-language information seamlessly. BAN considers bilinear interactions among two groups of input channels, while low-rank bilinear pooling extracts the joint representations for each pair of channels. Furthermore, we propose a variant of multimodal residual networks to exploit eight-attention maps of the BAN efficiently. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our model on visual question answering (VQA 2.0) and Flickr30k Entities datasets, showing that BAN significantly outperforms previous methods and achieves new state-of-the-arts on both datasets. 
### 381.DEEPEYE: A Compact and Accurate Video Comprehension at Terminal Devices  Compressed with Quantization and Tensorization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07935.pdf)
> As it requires a huge number of parameters when exposed to high dimensional inputs in video detection and classification, there is a grand challenge to develop a compact yet accurate video comprehension at terminal devices. Current works focus on optimizations of video detection and classification in a separated fashion. In this paper, we introduce a video comprehension (object detection and action recognition) system for terminal devices, namely DEEPEYE. Based on You Only Look Once (YOLO), we have developed an 8-bit quantization method when training YOLO; and also developed a tensorized-compression method of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) composed of features extracted from YOLO. The developed quantization and tensorization can significantly compress the original network model yet with maintained accuracy. Using the challenging video datasets: MOMENTS and UCF11 as benchmarks, the results show that the proposed DEEPEYE achieves 3.994x model compression rate with only 0.47% mAP decreased; and 15,047x parameter reduction and 2.87x speed-up with 16.58% accuracy improvement. 
### 382.Coarse-to-Fine Salient Object Detection with Low-Rank Matrix Recovery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07936.pdf)
> Despite the great potential of using the low-rank matrix recovery (LRMR) theory on the task of salient object detection, existing LRMR-based approaches scarcely consider the interrelationship among elements within the sparse components and suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel LRMR-based saliency detection method under a coarse-to-fine framework to circumvent these two limitations. The first step of our approach is to generate a coarse saliency map by integrating a $\ell_1$-norm sparsity constraint imposed on the sparse matrix and a Laplacian regularization for smoothness. Following this, we aim to exploit and reveal the interrelationship among sparse elements and to increase detection recall values near the object boundaries using a learned mapping function to precisely distinguish foreground and background in the cluttered or complex scenes. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve enhanced performance compared with other $12$ state-of-the-art saliency detection approaches, and also verifies the efficacy of our coarse-to-fine architecture. 
### 383.Anime Style Space Exploration Using Metric Learning and Generative  Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07997.pdf)
> Deep learning-based style transfer between images has recently become a popular area of research. A common way of encoding "style" is through a feature representation based on the Gram matrix of features extracted by some pre-trained neural network or some other form of feature statistics. Such a definition is based on an arbitrary human decision and may not best capture what a style really is. In trying to gain a better understanding of "style", we propose a metric learning-based method to explicitly encode the style of an artwork. In particular, our definition of style captures the differences between artists, as shown by classification performances, and such that the style representation can be interpreted, manipulated and visualized through style-conditioned image generation through a Generative Adversarial Network. We employ this method to explore the style space of anime portrait illustrations. 
### 384.Adversarial Noise Layer: Regularize Neural Network By Adding Noise [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08000.pdf)
> In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization method called Adversarial Noise Layer (ANL), which significantly improve the CNN's generalization ability by adding adversarial noise in the hidden layers. ANL is easy to implement and can be integrated with most of the CNN-based models. We compared the impact of the different type of noise and visually demonstrate that adversarial noise guide CNNs to learn to extract cleaner feature maps, further reducing the risk of over-fitting. We also conclude that the model trained with ANL is more robust to FGSM and IFGSM attack. Code is available at: <a href="https://github.com/youzhonghui/ANL">this https URL</a> 
### 385.Object Detection in Equirectangular Panorama [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08009.pdf)
> We introduced a high-resolution equirectangular panorama (360-degree, virtual reality) dataset for object detection and propose a multi-projection variant of YOLO detector. The main challenge with equirectangular panorama image are i) the lack of annotated training data, ii) high-resolution imagery and iii) severe geometric distortions of objects near the panorama projection poles. In this work, we solve the challenges by i) using training examples available in the "conventional datasets" (ImageNet and COCO), ii) employing only low-resolution images that require only moderate GPU computing power and memory, and iii) our multi-projection YOLO handles projection distortions by making multiple stereographic sub-projections. In our experiments, YOLO outperforms the other state-of-art detector, Faster RCNN and our multi-projection YOLO achieves the best accuracy with low-resolution input. 
### 386.DifNet: Semantic Segmentation by Diffusion Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08015.pdf)
> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently shown state of the art performance on semantic segmentation tasks, however they still suffer from problems of poor boundary localization and spatial fragmented predictions. The difficulties lie in the requirement of making dense predictions from a long path model all at once, since details are hard to keep when data goes through deeper layers. Instead, in this work, we decompose this difficult task into two relative simple sub-tasks: seed detection which is required to predict initial predictions without need of wholeness and preciseness, and similarity estimation which measures the possibility of any two nodes belong to the same class without need of knowing which class they are. We use one branch for one sub-task each, and apply a cascade of random walks base on hierarchical semantics to approximate a complex diffusion process which propagates seed information to the whole image according to the estimated similarities. The proposed DifNet consistently produces improvements over the baseline models with the same depth and with equivalent number of parameters, and also achieves promising performance on Pascal VOC and Pascal Context dataset. Our DifNet is trained end-to-end without complex loss functions. 
### 387.DiDA: Disentangled Synthesis for Domain Adaptation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08019.pdf)
> Unsupervised domain adaptation aims at learning a shared model for two related, but not identical, domains by leveraging supervision from a source domain to an unsupervised target domain. A number of effective domain adaptation approaches rely on the ability to extract discriminative, yet domain-invariant, latent factors which are common to both domains. Extracting latent commonality is also useful for disentanglement analysis, enabling separation between the common and the domain-specific features of both domains. In this paper, we present a method for boosting domain adaptation performance by leveraging disentanglement analysis. The key idea is that by learning to separately extract both the common and the domain-specific features, one can synthesize more target domain data with supervision, thereby boosting the domain adaptation performance. Better common feature extraction, in turn, helps further improve the disentanglement analysis and disentangled synthesis. We show that iterating between domain adaptation and disentanglement analysis can consistently improve each other on several unsupervised domain adaptation tasks, for various domain adaptation backbone models. 
### 388.Variational based Mixed Noise Removal with CNN Deep Learning  Regularization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08094.pdf)
> In this paper, the traditional model based variational method and learning based algorithms are naturally integrated to address mixed noise removal problem. To be different from single type noise (e.g. Gaussian) removal, it is a challenge problem to accurately discriminate noise types and levels for each pixel. We propose a variational method to iteratively estimate the noise parameters, and then the algorithm can automatically classify the noise according to the different statistical parameters. The proposed variational problem can be separated into regularization, synthesis, parameter estimation and noise classification four steps with the operator splitting scheme. Each step is related to an optimization subproblem. To enforce the regularization, the deep learning method is employed to learn the natural images priori. Compared with some model based regularizations, the CNN regularizer can significantly improve the quality of the restored images. Compared with some learning based methods, the synthesis step can produce better reconstructions by analyzing the recognized noise types and levels. In our method, the convolution neutral network (CNN) can be regarded as an operator which associated to a variational functional. From this viewpoint, the proposed method can be extended to many image reconstruction and inverse problems. Numerical experiments in the paper show that our method can achieve some state-of-the-art results for mixed noise removal. 
### 389.Comparison of Semantic Segmentation Approaches for Horizon/Sky Line  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08105.pdf)
> Horizon or skyline detection plays a vital role towards mountainous visual geo-localization, however most of the recently proposed visual geo-localization approaches rely on \textbf{user-in-the-loop} skyline detection methods. Detecting such a segmenting boundary fully autonomously would definitely be a step forward for these localization approaches. This paper provides a quantitative comparison of four such methods for autonomous horizon/sky line detection on an extensive data set. Specifically, we provide the comparison between four recently proposed segmentation methods; one explicitly targeting the problem of horizon detection\cite{Ahmad15}, second focused on visual geo-localization but relying on accurate detection of skyline \cite{Saurer16} and other two proposed for general semantic segmentation -- Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) \cite{Long15} and SegNet\cite{Badrinarayanan15}. Each of the first two methods is trained on a common training set \cite{Baatz12} comprised of about 200 images while models for the third and fourth method are fine tuned for sky segmentation problem through transfer learning using the same data set. Each of the method is tested on an extensive test set (about 3K images) covering various challenging geographical, weather, illumination and seasonal conditions. We report average accuracy and average absolute pixel error for each of the presented formulation. 
### 390.Stacked Semantic-Guided Attention Model for Fine-Grained Zero-Shot  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08113.pdf)
> Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) is achieved via aligning the semantic relationships between the global image feature vector and the corresponding class semantic descriptions. However, using the global features to represent fine-grained images may lead to sub-optimal results since they neglect the discriminative differences of local regions. Besides, different regions contain distinct discriminative information. The important regions should contribute more to the prediction. To this end, we propose a novel stacked semantics-guided attention (S2GA) model to obtain semantic relevant features by using individual class semantic features to progressively guide the visual features to generate an attention map for weighting the importance of different local regions. Feeding both the integrated visual features and the class semantic features into a multi-class classification architecture, the proposed framework can be trained end-to-end. Extensive experimental results on CUB and NABird datasets show that the proposed approach has a consistent improvement on both fine-grained zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks. 
### 391.Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08136.pdf)
> Adapting deep networks to new concepts from few examples is extremely challenging, due to the high computational and data requirements of standard fine-tuning procedures. Most works on meta-learning and few-shot learning have thus focused on simple learning techniques for adaptation, such as nearest neighbors or gradient descent. Nonetheless, the machine learning literature contains a wealth of methods that learn non-deep models very efficiently. In this work we propose to use these fast convergent methods as the main adaptation mechanism for few-shot learning. The main idea is to teach a deep network to use standard machine learning tools, such as logistic regression, as part of its own internal model, enabling it to quickly adapt to novel tasks. This requires back-propagating errors through the solver steps. While normally the matrix operations involved would be costly, the small number of examples works to our advantage, by making use of the Woodbury identity. We propose both iterative and closed-form solvers, based on logistic regression and ridge regression components. Our methods achieve excellent performance on three few-shot learning benchmarks, showing competitive performance on Omniglot and surpassing all state-of-the-art alternatives on miniImageNet and CIFAR-100. 
### 392.VideoCapsuleNet: A Simplified Network for Action Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08162.pdf)
> The recent advances in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have shown extremely good results for video human action classification, however, action detection is still a challenging problem. The current action detection approaches follow a complex pipeline which involves multiple tasks such as tube proposals, optical flow, and tube classification. In this work, we present a more elegant solution for action detection based on the recently developed capsule network. We propose a 3D capsule network for videos, called VideoCapsuleNet: a unified network for action detection which can jointly perform pixel-wise action segmentation along with action classification. The proposed network is a generalization of capsule network from 2D to 3D, which takes a sequence of video frames as input. The 3D generalization drastically increases the number of capsules in the network, making capsule routing computationally expensive. We introduce capsule-pooling in the convolutional capsule layer to address this issue which makes the voting algorithm tractable. The routing-by-agreement in the network inherently models the action representations and various action characteristics are captured by the predicted capsules. This inspired us to utilize the capsules for action localization and the class-specific capsules predicted by the network are used to determine a pixel-wise localization of actions. The localization is further improved by parameterized skip connections with the convolutional capsule layers and the network is trained end-to-end with a classification as well as localization loss. The proposed network achieves sate-of-the-art performance on multiple action detection datasets including UCF-Sports, J-HMDB, and UCF-101 (24 classes) with an impressive ~20% improvement on UCF-101 and ~15% improvement on J-HMDB in terms of v-mAP scores. 
### 393.Turbo Learning for Captionbot and Drawingbot [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08170.pdf)
> We study in this paper the problems of both image captioning and text-to-image generation, and present a novel turbo learning approach to jointly training an image-to-text generator (a.k.a. captionbot) and a text-to-image generator (a.k.a. drawingbot). The key idea behind the joint training is that image-to-text generation and text-to-image generation as dual problems can form a closed loop to provide informative feedback to each other. Based on such feedback, we introduce a new loss metric by comparing the original input with the output produced by the closed loop. In addition to the old loss metrics used in captionbot and drawingbot, this extra loss metric makes the jointly trained captionbot and drawingbot better than the separately trained captionbot and drawingbot. Furthermore, the turbo-learning approach enables semi-supervised learning since the closed loop can provide peudo-labels for unlabeled samples. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate that the proposed turbo learning can significantly improve the performance of both captionbot and drawingbot by a large margin.

### 395.Constrained Sparse Subspace Clustering with Side-Information [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08183.pdf)
> Subspace clustering refers to the problem of segmenting high dimensional data drawn from a union of subspaces into the respective subspaces. In some applications, partial side-information to indicate "must-link" or "cannot-link" in clustering is available. This leads to the task of subspace clustering with side-information. However, in prior work the supervision value of the side-information for subspace clustering has not been fully exploited. To this end, in this paper, we present an enhanced approach for constrained subspace clustering with side-information, termed Constrained Sparse Subspace Clustering plus (CSSC+), in which the side-information is used not only in the stage of learning an affinity matrix but also in the stage of spectral clustering. Moreover, we propose to estimate clustering accuracy based on the partial side-information and theoretically justify the connection to the ground-truth clustering accuracy in terms of the Rand index. We conduct experiments on three cancer gene expression datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposals. 
### 396.Hierarchically Structured Reinforcement Learning for Topically Coherent  Visual Story Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08191.pdf)
> We propose a hierarchically structured reinforcement learning approach to address the challenges of planning for generating coherent multi-sentence stories for the visual storytelling task. Within our framework, the task of generating a story given a sequence of images is divided across a two-level hierarchical decoder. The high-level decoder constructs a plan by generating a semantic concept (i.e., topic) for each image in sequence. The low-level decoder generates a sentence for each image using a semantic compositional network, which effectively grounds the sentence generation conditioned on the topic. The two decoders are jointly trained end-to-end using reinforcement learning. We evaluate our model on the visual storytelling (VIST) dataset. Empirical results from both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that the proposed hierarchically structured reinforced training achieves significantly better performance compared to a strong flat deep reinforcement learning baseline. 
### 397.Improving CNN classifiers by estimating test-time priors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08235.pdf)
> The problem of different training and test set class priors is addressed in the context of CNN classifiers. An EM-based algorithm for test-time class priors estimation is evaluated on fine-grained computer vision problems for both the batch and on-line situations. Experimental results show a significant improvement on the fine-grained classification tasks using the known evaluation-time priors, increasing the top-1 accuracy by 4.0% on the FGVC iNaturalist 2018 validation set and by 3.9% on the FGVCx Fungi 2018 validation set. Iterative estimation of test-time priors on the PlantCLEF 2017 dataset increased the image classification accuracy by 3.4%, allowing a single CNN model to achieve state-of-the-art results and outperform the competition-winning ensemble of 12 CNNs. 
### 398.Hybrid Retrieval-Generation Reinforced Agent for Medical Image Report  Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08298.pdf)
> Generating long and coherent reports to describe medical images poses challenges to bridging visual patterns with informative human linguistic descriptions. We propose a novel Hybrid Retrieval-Generation Reinforced Agent (HRGR-Agent) which reconciles traditional retrieval-based approaches populated with human prior knowledge, with modern learning-based approaches to achieve structured, robust, and diverse report generation. HRGR-Agent employs a hierarchical decision-making procedure. For each sentence, a high-level retrieval policy module chooses to either retrieve a template sentence from an off-the-shelf template database, or invoke a low-level generation module to generate a new sentence. HRGR-Agent is updated via reinforcement learning, guided by sentence-level and word-level rewards. Experiments show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on two medical report datasets, generating well-balanced structured sentences with robust coverage of heterogeneous medical report contents. In addition, our model achieves the highest detection accuracy of medical terminologies, and improved human evaluation performance. 
### 399.Compression of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks under Joint Sparsity  Constraints [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08303.pdf)
> We consider the optimization of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such that they provide good performance while having reduced complexity if deployed on either conventional systems utilizing spatial-domain convolution or lower complexity systems designed for Winograd convolution. Furthermore, we explore the universal quantization and compression of these networks. In particular, the proposed framework produces one compressed model whose convolutional filters are sparse not only in the spatial domain but also in the Winograd domain. Hence, one compressed model can be deployed universally on any platform, without need for re-training on the deployed platform, and the sparsity of its convolutional filters can be exploited for further complexity reduction in either domain. To get a better compression ratio, the sparse model is compressed in the spatial domain which has a less number of parameters. From our experiments, we obtain $24.2\times$, $47.7\times$ and $35.4\times$ compressed models for ResNet-18, AlexNet and CT-SRCNN, while their computational complexity is also reduced by $4.5\times$, $5.1\times$ and $23.5\times$, respectively. 
### 400.Learning long-range spatial dependencies with horizontal gated-recurrent  units [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08315.pdf)
> Progress in deep learning has spawned great successes in many engineering applications. As a prime example, convolutional neural networks, a type of feedforward neural networks, are now approaching -- and sometimes even surpassing -- human accuracy on a variety of visual recognition tasks. Here, however, we show that these neural networks and their recent extensions struggle in recognition tasks where co-dependent visual features must be detected over long spatial ranges. We introduce the horizontal gated-recurrent unit (hGRU) to learn intrinsic horizontal connections -- both within and across feature columns. We demonstrate that a single hGRU layer matches or outperforms all tested feedforward hierarchical baselines including state-of-the-art architectures which have orders of magnitude more free parameters. We further discuss the biological plausibility of the hGRU in comparison to anatomical data from the visual cortex as well as human behavioral data on a classic contour detection task. 
### 401.Measurement-wise Occlusion in Multi-object Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08324.pdf)
> Handling object interaction is a fundamental challenge in practical multi-object tracking, even for simple interactive effects such as one object temporarily occluding another. We formalize the problem of occlusion in tracking with two different abstractions. In object-wise occlusion, objects that are occluded by other objects do not generate measurements. In measurement-wise occlusion, a previously unstudied approach, all objects may generate measurements but some measurements may be occluded by others. While the relative validity of each abstraction depends on the situation and sensor, measurement-wise occlusion fits into probabilistic multi-object tracking algorithms with much looser assumptions on object interaction. Its value is demonstrated by showing that it naturally derives a popular approximation for lidar tracking, and by an example of visual tracking in image space. 
### 402.Learning Markov Clustering Networks for Scene Text Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08365.pdf)
> A novel framework named Markov Clustering Network (MCN) is proposed for fast and robust scene text detection. MCN predicts instance-level bounding boxes by firstly converting an image into a Stochastic Flow Graph (SFG) and then performing Markov Clustering on this graph. Our method can detect text objects with arbitrary size and orientation without prior knowledge of object size. The stochastic flow graph encode objects' local correlation and semantic information. An object is modeled as strongly connected nodes, which allows flexible bottom-up detection for scale-varying and rotated objects. MCN generates bounding boxes without using Non-Maximum Suppression, and it can be fully parallelized on GPUs. The evaluation on public benchmarks shows that our method outperforms the existing methods by a large margin in detecting multioriented text objects. MCN achieves new state-of-art performance on challenging MSRA-TD500 dataset with precision of 0.88, recall of 0.79 and F-score of 0.83. Also, MCN achieves realtime inference with frame rate of 34 FPS, which is $1.5\times$ speedup when compared with the fastest scene text detection algorithm. 
### 403.Deep Learning with Cinematic Rendering - Fine-Tuning Deep Neural  Networks Using Photorealistic Medical Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08400.pdf)
> Deep learning has emerged as a powerful artificial intelligence tool to interpret medical images for a growing variety of applications. However, the paucity of medical imaging data with high-quality annotations that is necessary for training such methods ultimately limits their performance. Medical data is challenging to acquire due to privacy issues, shortage of experts available for annotation, limited representation of rare conditions and cost. This problem has previously been addressed by using synthetically generated data. However, networks trained on synthetic data often fail to generalize to real data. Cinematic rendering simulates the propagation and interaction of light passing through tissue models reconstructed from CT data, enabling the generation of photorealistic images. In this paper, we present one of the first applications of cinematic rendering in deep learning, in which we propose to fine-tune synthetic data-driven networks using cinematically rendered CT data for the task of monocular depth estimation in endoscopy. Our experiments demonstrate that: (a) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on synthetic data and fine-tuned on photorealistic cinematically rendered data adapt better to real medical images and demonstrate more robust performance when compared to networks with no fine-tuning, (b) these fine-tuned networks require less training data to converge to an optimal solution, and (c) fine-tuning with data from a variety of photorealistic rendering conditions of the same scene prevents the network from learning patient-specific information and aids in generalizability of the model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that networks fine-tuned with cinematically rendered data predict depth with 56.87% less error for rendered endoscopy images and 27.49% less error for real porcine colon endoscopy images. 
### 404.Autofocus Layer for Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08403.pdf)
> We propose the autofocus convolutional layer for semantic segmentation with the objective of enhancing the capabilities of neural networks for multi-scale processing. Autofocus layers adaptively change the size of the effective receptive field based on the processed context to generate more powerful features. This is achieved by parallelising multiple convolutional layers with different dilation rates, combined by an attention mechanism that learns to focus on the optimal scales driven by context. By sharing the weights of the parallel convolutions we make the network scale-invariant, with only a modest increase in the number of parameters. The proposed autofocus layer can be easily integrated into existing networks to improve a model's representational power. We evaluate our models on the challenging tasks of multi-organ segmentation in pelvic CT and brain tumor segmentation in MRI and achieve very promising performance. 
### 405.Training Convolutional Networks with Web Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08416.pdf)
> In this thesis we investigate the effect of using web images to build a large scale database to be used along a deep learning method for a classification task. We replicate the ImageNet large scale database (ILSVRC-2012) from images collected from the web using 4 different download strategies varying: the search engine, the query and the image resolution. As a deep learning method, we will choose the Convolutional Neural Network that was very successful with recognition tasks; the AlexNet. 
### 406.Enriched Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network for Facial  Micro-Expression Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08417.pdf)
> Facial micro-expression (ME) recognition has posed a huge challenge to researchers for its subtlety in motion and limited databases. Recently, handcrafted techniques have achieved superior performance in micro-expression recognition but at the cost of domain specificity and cumbersome parametric tunings. In this paper, we propose an Enriched Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (ELRCN) that first encodes each micro-expression frame into a feature vector through CNN module(s), then predicts the micro-expression by passing the feature vector through a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) module. The framework contains two different network variants: (1) Channel-wise stacking of input data for spatial enrichment, (2) Feature-wise stacking of features for temporal enrichment. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve reasonably good performance, without data augmentation. In addition, we also present ablation studies conducted on the framework and visualizations of what CNN "sees" when predicting the micro-expression classes. 
### 407.Scene Coordinate and Correspondence Learning for Image-Based  Localization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08443.pdf)
> Scene coordinate regression has become an essential part of current camera re-localization methods. Different versions, such as regression forests and deep learning methods, have been successfully applied to estimate the corresponding camera pose given a single input image. In this work, we propose to regress the scene coordinates pixel-wise for a given RGB image by using deep learning. Compared to the recent methods, which usually employ RANSAC to obtain a robust pose estimate from the established point correspondences, we propose to regress confidences of these correspondences, which allows us to immediately discard erroneous predictions and improve the initial pose estimates. Finally, the resulting confidences can be used to score initial pose hypothesis and aid in pose refinement, offering a generalized solution to solve this task. 
### 408.Pose-Based Two-Stream Relational Networks for Action Recognition in  Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08484.pdf)
> Recently, pose-based action recognition has gained more and more attention due to the better performance compared with traditional appearance-based methods. However, there still exist two problems to be further solved. First, existing pose-based methods generally recognize human actions with captured 3D human poses which are very difficult to obtain in real scenarios. Second, few pose-based methods model the action-related objects in recognizing human-object interaction actions in which objects play an important role. To solve the problems above, we propose a pose-based two-stream relational network (PSRN) for action recognition. In PSRN, one stream models the temporal dynamics of the targeted 2D human pose sequences which are directly extracted from raw videos, and the other stream models the action-related objects from a randomly sampled video frame. Most importantly, instead of fusing two-streams in the class score layer as before, we propose a pose-object relational network to model the relationship between human poses and action-related objects. We evaluate the proposed PSRN on two challenging benchmarks, i.e., Sub-JHMDB and PennAction. Experimental results show that our PSRN obtains the state-the-of-art performance on Sub-JHMDB (80.2%) and PennAction (98.1%). Our work opens a new door to action recognition by combining 2D human pose extracted from raw video and image appearance. 
### 409.Knowledge-based Fully Convolutional Network and Its Application in  Segmentation of Lung CT Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08492.pdf)
> A variety of deep neural networks have been applied in medical image segmentation and achieve good performance. Unlike natural images, medical images of the same imaging modality are characterized by the same pattern, which indicates that same normal organs or tissues locate at similar positions in the images. Thus, in this paper we try to incorporate the prior knowledge of medical images into the structure of neural networks such that the prior knowledge can be utilized for accurate segmentation. Based on this idea, we propose a novel deep network called knowledge-based fully convolutional network (KFCN) for medical image segmentation. The segmentation function and corresponding error is analyzed. We show the existence of an asymptotically stable region for KFCN which traditional FCN doesn't possess. Experiments validate our knowledge assumption about the incorporation of prior knowledge into the convolution kernels of KFCN and show that KFCN can achieve a reasonable segmentation and a satisfactory accuracy. 
### 410.Blind Predicting Similar Quality Map for Image Quality Assessment [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08493.pdf)
> A key problem in blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is how to effectively model the properties of human visual system in a data-driven manner. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient BIQA model based on a novel framework which consists of a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) and a pooling network to solve this problem. In principle, FCNN is capable of predicting a pixel-by-pixel similar quality map only from a distorted image by using the intermediate similarity maps derived from conventional full-reference image quality assessment methods. The predicted pixel-by-pixel quality maps have good consistency with the distortion correlations between the reference and distorted images. Finally, a deep pooling network regresses the quality map into a score. Experiments have demonstrated that our predictions outperform many state-of-the-art BIQA methods. 
### 411.OmniDetector: With Neural Networks to Bounding Boxes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08503.pdf)
> We propose a person detector on omnidirectional images, an accurate method to generate minimal enclosing rectangles of persons. The basic idea is to adapt the qualitative detection performance of a convolutional neural network based method, namely YOLOv2 to fish-eye images. The design of our approach picks up the idea of a state-of-the-art object detector and highly overlapping areas of images with their regions of interests. This overlap reduces the number of false negatives. Based on the raw bounding boxes of the detector we fine-tuned overlapping bounding boxes by three approaches. The non-maximum suppression, the soft non-maximum suppression and the soft non-maximum suppression with Gaussian smoothing. The evaluation was done on the PIROPO database, supplemented with bounding boxes on omnidirectional images. We achieve an average precision of 64.4 % with YOLOv2 for the class person. For this purpose we fine-tuned the soft non-maximum suppression with Gaussian smoothing. 
### 412.Part-Based Tracking by Sampling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08511.pdf)
> We propose a novel part-based method for tracking an arbitrary object in challenging video sequences, focusing on robustly tracking under the effects of camera motion and object motion change. Each of a group of tracked image patches on the target is represented by pairs of RGB pixel samples and counts of how many pixels in the patch are similar to them. This empirically characterises the underlying colour distribution of the patches and allows for matching using the Bhattacharyya distance. Candidate patch locations are generated by applying non-shearing affine transformations to the patches' previous locations, followed by local optimisation. Experiments using the VOT2016 dataset show that our tracker out-performs all other part-based trackers in terms of robustness to camera motion and object motion change. 
### 413.Fast Motion Deblurring for Feature Detection and Matching Using Inertial  Measurements [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08542.pdf)
> Many computer vision and image processing applications rely on local features. It is well-known that motion blur decreases the performance of traditional feature detectors and descriptors. We propose an inertial-based deblurring method for improving the robustness of existing feature detectors and descriptors against the motion blur. Unlike most deblurring algorithms, the method can handle spatially-variant blur and rolling shutter distortion. Furthermore, it is capable of running in real-time contrary to state-of-the-art algorithms. The limitations of inertial-based blur estimation are taken into account by validating the blur estimates using image data. The evaluation shows that when the method is used with traditional feature detector and descriptor, it increases the number of detected keypoints, provides higher repeatability and improves the localization accuracy. We also demonstrate that such features will lead to more accurate and complete reconstructions when used in the application of 3D visual reconstruction. 
### 414.A Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Sensorless Force  Estimation in Robotic Surgery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08545.pdf)
> Providing force feedback as relevant information in current Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery systems constitutes a technological challenge due to the constraints imposed by the surgical environment. In this context, Sensorless Force Estimation techniques represent a potential solution, enabling to sense the interaction forces between the surgical instruments and soft-tissues. Specifically, if visual feedback is available for observing soft-tissues' deformation, this feedback can be used to estimate the forces applied to these tissues. To this end, a force estimation model, based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Long-Short Term Memory networks, is proposed in this work. This model is designed to process both, the spatiotemporal information present in video sequences and the temporal structure of tool data (the surgical tool-tip trajectory and its grasping status). A series of analyses are carried out to reveal the advantages of the proposal and the challenges that remain for real applications. This research work focuses on two surgical task scenarios, referred to as pushing and pulling tissue. For these two scenarios, different input data modalities and their effect on the force estimation quality are investigated. These input data modalities are tool data, video sequences and a combination of both. The results suggest that the force estimation quality is better when both, the tool data and video sequences, are processed by the neural network model. Moreover, this study reveals the need for a loss function, designed to promote the modeling of smooth and sharp details found in force signals. Finally, the results show that the modeling of forces due to pulling tasks is more challenging than for the simplest pushing actions. 
### 415.Less is More: Surgical Phase Recognition with Less Annotations through  Self-Supervised Pre-training of CNN-LSTM Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08569.pdf)
> Real-time algorithms for automatically recognizing surgical phases are needed to develop systems that can provide assistance to surgeons, enable better management of operating room (OR) resources and consequently improve safety within the OR. State-of-the-art surgical phase recognition algorithms using laparoscopic videos are based on fully supervised training. This limits their potential for widespread application, since creation of manual annotations is an expensive process considering the numerous types of existing surgeries and the vast amount of laparoscopic videos available. In this work, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach based on the prediction of remaining surgery duration (RSD) from laparoscopic videos. The RSD prediction task is used to pre-train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network in an end-to-end manner. Our proposed approach utilizes all available data and reduces the reliance on annotated data, thereby facilitating the scaling up of surgical phase recognition algorithms to different kinds of surgeries. Additionally, we present EndoN2N, an end-to-end trained CNN-LSTM model for surgical phase recognition and evaluate the performance of our approach on a dataset of 120 Cholecystectomy laparoscopic videos (Cholec120). This work also presents the first systematic study of self-supervised pre-training approaches to understand the amount of annotations required for surgical phase recognition. Interestingly, the proposed RSD pre-training approach leads to performance improvement even when all the training data is manually annotated and outperforms the single pre-training approach for surgical phase recognition presently published in the literature. It is also observed that end-to-end training of CNN-LSTM networks boosts surgical phase recognition performance. 
### 416.Clinical evaluation of semi-automatic opensource algorithmic software  segmentation of the mandibular bone: Practical feasibility and assessment of  a new course of action [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08604.pdf)
> Computer assisted technologies based on algorithmic software segmentation are an increasing topic of interest in complex surgical cases. However - due to functional instability, time consuming software processes, personnel resources or licensed-based financial costs many segmentation processes are often outsourced from clinical centers to third parties and the industry. Therefore, the aim of this trial was to assess the practical feasibility of an easy available, functional stable and licensed-free segmentation approach to be used in the clinical practice. In this retrospective, randomized, controlled trail the accuracy and accordance of the open-source based segmentation algorithm GrowCut (GC) was assessed through the comparison to the manually generated ground truth of the same anatomy using 10 CT lower jaw data-sets from the clinical routine. Assessment parameters were the segmentation time, the volume, the voxel number, the Dice Score (DSC) and the Hausdorff distance (HD). Overall segmentation times were about one minute. Mean DSC values of over 85% and HD below 33.5 voxel could be achieved. Statistical differences between the assessment parameters were not significant (p&lt;0.05) and correlation coefficients were close to the value one (r &gt; 0.94). Complete functional stable and time saving segmentations with high accuracy and high positive correlation could be performed by the presented interactive open-source based approach. In the cranio-maxillofacial complex the used method could represent an algorithmic alternative for image-based segmentation in the clinical practice for e.g. surgical treatment planning or visualization of postoperative results and offers several advantages. Systematic comparisons to other segmentation approaches or with a greater data amount are areas of future works. 
### 417.Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08620.pdf)
> Spatial and spectral approaches are two major approaches for image processing tasks such as image classification and object recognition. Among many such algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved significant performance improvement in many challenging tasks. Since CNNs process images directly in the spatial domain, they are essentially spatial approaches. Given that spatial and spectral approaches are known to have different characteristics, it will be interesting to incorporate a spectral approach into CNNs. We propose a novel CNN architecture, wavelet CNNs, which combines a multiresolution analysis and CNNs into one model. Our insight is that a CNN can be viewed as a limited form of a multiresolution analysis. Based on this insight, we supplement missing parts of the multiresolution analysis via wavelet transform and integrate them as additional components in the entire architecture. Wavelet CNNs allow us to utilize spectral information which is mostly lost in conventional CNNs but useful in most image processing tasks. We evaluate the practical performance of wavelet CNNs on texture classification and image annotation. The experiments show that wavelet CNNs can achieve better accuracy in both tasks than existing models while having significantly fewer parameters than conventional CNNs. 
### 418.Deep Learning Inference on Embedded Devices: Fixed-Point vs Posit [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08624.pdf)
> Performing the inference step of deep learning in resource constrained environments, such as embedded devices, is challenging. Success requires optimization at both software and hardware levels. Low precision arithmetic and specifically low precision fixed-point number systems have become the standard for performing deep learning inference. However, representing non-uniform data and distributed parameters (e.g. weights) by using uniformly distributed fixed-point values is still a major drawback when using this number system. Recently, the posit number system was proposed, which represents numbers in a non-uniform manner. Therefore, in this paper we are motivated to explore using the posit number system to represent the weights of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. However, we do not apply any quantization techniques and hence the network weights do not require re-training. The results of this exploration show that using the posit number system outperformed the fixed point number system in terms of accuracy and memory utilization. 
### 419.Facade Segmentation in the Wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08634.pdf)
> Urban facade segmentation from automatically acquired imagery, in contrast to traditional image segmentation, poses several unique challenges. 360-degree photospheres captured from vehicles are an effective way to capture a large number of images, but this data presents difficult-to-model warping and stitching artifacts. In addition, each pixel can belong to multiple facade elements, and different facade elements (e.g., window, balcony, sill, etc.) are correlated and vary wildly in their characteristics. In this paper, we propose three network architectures of varying complexity to achieve multilabel semantic segmentation of facade images while exploiting their unique characteristics. Specifically, we propose a MULTIFACSEGNET architecture to assign multiple labels to each pixel, a SEPARABLE architecture as a low-rank formulation that encourages extraction of rectangular elements, and a COMPATIBILITY network that simultaneously seeks segmentation across facade element types allowing the network to 'see' intermediate output probabilities of the various facade element classes. Our results on benchmark datasets show significant improvements over existing facade segmentation approaches for the typical facade elements. For example, on one commonly used dataset, the accuracy scores for window(the most important architectural element) increases from 0.91 to 0.97 percent compared to the best competing method, and comparable improvements on other element types. 
### 420.Constructing Compact Brain Connectomes for Individual Fingerprinting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08649.pdf)
> Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that functional connectomes are unique to individuals, i.e., two distinct fMRIs taken over different sessions of the same subject are more similar in terms of their connectomes than those from two different subjects. In this study, we present significant new results that identify specific parts of the connectome that code the unique signatures. We show that a very small part of the connectome (under 100 features from among over 64K total features) is responsible for the signatures. A network of these features is shown to achieve excellent training and test accuracy in matching imaging datasets. We show that these features are statistically significant, robust to perturbations, invariant across populations, and are localized to a small number of structural regions of the brain (12 regions from among 180). We develop an innovative matrix sampling technique to derive computationally efficient and accurate methods for identifying the discriminating sub-connectome and support all of our claims using state of the art statistical tests and computational techniques. 
### 421.Convexity Shape Prior for Level Set based Image Segmentation Method [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08676.pdf)
> We propose a geometric convexity shape prior preservation method for variational level set based image segmentation methods. Our method is built upon the fact that the level set of a convex signed distanced function must be convex. This property enables us to transfer a complicated geometrical convexity prior into a simple inequality constraint on the function. An active set based Gauss-Seidel iteration is used to handle this constrained minimization problem to get an efficient algorithm. We apply our method to region and edge based level set segmentation models including Chan-Vese (CV) model with guarantee that the segmented region will be convex. Experimental results show the effectiveness and quality of the proposed model and algorithm. 
### 422.Aesthetics Assessment of Images Containing Faces [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08685.pdf)
> Recent research has widely explored the problem of aesthetics assessment of images with generic content. However, few approaches have been specifically designed to predict the aesthetic quality of images containing human faces, which make up a massive portion of photos in the web. This paper introduces a method for aesthetic quality assessment of images with faces. We exploit three different Convolutional Neural Networks to encode information regarding perceptual quality, global image aesthetics, and facial attributes; then, a model is trained to combine these features to explicitly predict the aesthetics of images containing faces. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods for both binary, i.e. low/high, and continuous aesthetic score prediction on four different databases in the state-of-the-art. 
### 423.Attaining human-level performance for anatomical landmark detection in  3D CT data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08687.pdf)
> We present an efficient neural network approach for locating anatomical landmarks, using a two-pass, two-resolution cascaded approach which leverages a mechanism we term atlas location autocontext. Location predictions are made by regression to Gaussian heatmaps, one heatmap per landmark. This system allows patchwise application of a shallow network, thus enabling the prediction of multiple volumetric heatmaps in a unified system, without prohibitive GPU memory requirements. Evaluation is performed for 22 landmarks defined on a range of structures in head CT scans and the neural network model is benchmarked against a previously reported decision forest model trained with the same cascaded system. Models are trained and validated on 201 scans. Over the final test set of 20 scans which was independently annotated by 2 observers, we show that the neural network reaches an accuracy which matches the annotator variability. 
### 424.Fused Deep Neural Networks for Efficient Pedestrian Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08688.pdf)
> In this paper, we present an efficient pedestrian detection system, designed by fusion of multiple deep neural network (DNN) systems. Pedestrian candidates are first generated by a single shot convolutional multi-box detector at different locations with various scales and aspect ratios. The candidate generator is designed to provide the majority of ground truth pedestrian annotations at the cost of a large number of false positives. Then, a classification system using the idea of ensemble learning is deployed to improve the detection accuracy. The classification system further classifies the generated candidates based on opinions of multiple deep verification networks and a fusion network which utilizes a novel soft-rejection fusion method to adjust the confidence in the detection results. To improve the training of the deep verification networks, a novel soft-label method is devised to assign floating point labels to the generated pedestrian candidates. A deep context aggregation semantic segmentation network also provides pixel-level classification of the scene and its results are softly fused with the detection results by the single shot detector. Our pedestrian detector compared favorably to state-of-art methods on all popular pedestrian detection datasets. For example, our fused DNN has better detection accuracy on the Caltech Pedestrian dataset than all previous state of art methods, while also being the fastest. We significantly improved the log-average miss rate on the Caltech pedestrian dataset to 7.67% and achieved the new state-of-the-art. 
### 425.Object Detection and Classification in Occupancy Grid Maps using Deep  Convolutional Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08689.pdf)
> A detailed environment perception is a crucial component of automated vehicles. However, to deal with the amount of perceived information, we also require segmentation strategies. Based on a grid map environment representation, well-suited for sensor fusion, free-space estimation and machine learning, we detect and classify objects using deep convolutional neural networks. As input for our networks we use a multi-layer grid map efficiently encoding 3D range sensor information. The inference output consists of a list of rotated bounding boxes with associated semantic classes. We conduct extensive ablation studies, highlight important design considerations when using grid maps and evaluate our models on the KITTI Bird's Eye View benchmark. Qualitative and quantitative benchmark results show that we achieve robust detection and state of the art accuracy solely using top-view grid maps from range sensor data. 
### 426.Estimating Gradual-Emotional Behavior in One-Minute Videos with ESNs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08690.pdf)
> In this paper, we describe our approach for the OMG- Emotion Challenge 2018. The goal is to produce utterance-level valence and arousal estimations for videos of approximately 1 minute length. We tackle this problem by first extracting facial expressions features of videos as time series data, and then using Recurrent Neural Networks of the Echo State Network type to model the correspondence between the time series data and valence-arousal values. Experimentally we show that the proposed approach surpasses the baseline methods provided by the organizers. 
### 427.Highly Efficient 8-bit Low Precision Inference of Convolutional Neural  Networks with IntelCaffe [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08691.pdf)
> High throughput and low latency inference of deep neural networks are critical for the deployment of deep learning applications. This paper presents the efficient inference techniques of IntelCaffe, the first Intel optimized deep learning framework that supports efficient 8-bit low precision inference and model optimization techniques of convolutional neural networks on Intel Xeon Scalable Processors. The 8-bit optimized model is automatically generated with a calibration process from FP32 model without the need of fine-tuning or retraining. We show that the inference throughput and latency with ResNet-50, Inception-v3 and SSD are improved by 1.38X-2.9X and 1.35X-3X respectively with neglectable accuracy loss from IntelCaffe FP32 baseline and by 56X-75X and 26X-37X from BVLC Caffe. All these techniques have been open-sourced on IntelCaffe GitHub1, and the artifact is provided to reproduce the result on Amazon AWS Cloud. 
### 428.Assessing a mobile-based deep learning model for plant disease  surveillance [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08692.pdf)
> Convolutional neural network models (CNNs) have made major advances in computer vision tasks in the last five years. Given the challenge in collecting real world datasets, most studies report performance metrics based on available research datasets. In scenarios where CNNs are to be deployed on images or videos from mobile devices, models are presented with new challenges due to lighting, angle, and camera specifications, which are not accounted for in research datasets. It is essential for assessment to also be conducted on real world datasets if such models are to be reliably integrated with products and services in society. Plant disease datasets can be used to test CNNs in real time and gain insight into real world performance. We train a CNN object detection model to identify foliar symptoms of diseases (or lack thereof) in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). We then deploy the model on a mobile app and test its performance on mobile images and video of 720 diseased leaflets in an agricultural field in Tanzania. Within each disease category we test two levels of severity of symptoms - mild and pronounced, to assess the model performance for early detection of symptoms. In both severities we see a decrease in the F-1 score for real world images and video. The F-1 score dropped by 32% for pronounced symptoms in real world images (the closest data to the training data) due to a drop in model recall. If the potential of smartphone CNNs are to be realized our data suggest it is crucial to consider tuning precision and recall performance in order to achieve the desired performance in real world settings. In addition, the varied performance related to different input data (image or video) is an important consideration for the design of CNNs in real world applications. 
### 429.High throughput quantitative metallography for complex microstructures  using deep learning: A case study in ultrahigh carbon steel [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08693.pdf)
> We apply a deep convolutional neural network segmentation model to enable novel automated microstructure segmentation applications for complex microstructures typically evaluated manually and subjectively. We explore two microstructure segmentation tasks in an openly-available ultrahigh carbon steel microstructure dataset: segmenting cementite particles in the spheroidized matrix, and segmenting larger fields of view featuring grain boundary carbide, spheroidized particle matrix, particle-free grain boundary denuded zone, and Widmanst\"atten cementite. We also demonstrate how to combine these data-driven microstructure segmentation models to obtain empirical cementite particle size and denuded zone width distributions from more complex micrographs containing multiple microconstituents. The full annotated dataset is available on materialsdata.nist.gov (<a href="https://materialsdata.nist.gov/handle/11256/964">this https URL</a>). 
### 430.Image Based Fashion Product Recommendation with Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08694.pdf)
> We develop a two-stage deep learning framework that recommends fashion images based on other input images of similar style. For that purpose, a neural network classifier is used as a data-driven, visually-aware feature extractor. The latter then serves as input for similarity-based recommendations using a ranking algorithm. Our approach is tested on the publicly available Fashion dataset. Initialization strategies using transfer learning from larger product databases are presented. Combined with more traditional content-based recommendation systems, our framework can help to increase robustness and performance, for example, by better matching a particular customer style. 
### 431.SqueezeJet: High-level Synthesis Accelerator Design for Deep  Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08695.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks have dominated the pattern recognition scene by providing much more accurate solutions in computer vision problems such as object recognition and object detection. Most of these solutions come at a huge computational cost, requiring billions of multiply-accumulate operations and, thus, making their use quite challenging in real-time applications that run on embedded mobile (resource-power constrained) hardware. This work presents the architecture, the high-level synthesis design, and the implementation of SqueezeJet, an FPGA accelerator for the inference phase of the SqueezeNet DCNN architecture, which is designed specifically for use in embedded systems. Results show that SqueezeJet can achieve 15.16 times speed-up compared to the software implementation of SqueezeNet running on an embedded mobile processor with less than 1% drop in top-5 accuracy. 
### 432.Imitation Refinement [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08698.pdf)
> Many real-world tasks involve identifying patterns from data satisfying background and prior knowledge, for which the ground truth is not available, but ideal data can be obtained, for example, using theoretical simulations. We propose a novel approach, imitation refinement, which refines imperfect patterns by imitating ideal patterns. The imperfect patterns are obtained for example using an unsupervised learner. Imitation refinement imitates ideal data by incorporating prior knowledge captured by a classifier trained on the ideal data: an imitation refiner applies small modifications to imperfect patterns so that the classifier can identify them. In a sense, imitation refinement fits the data to the classifier, which complements the classical supervised learning task. We show that our imitation refinement approach outperforms existing methods in identifying crystal patterns from X-ray diffraction data in materials discovery. We also show the generality of our approach by illustrating its applicability to a computer vision task. 
### 433.OFF-ApexNet on Micro-expression Recognition System [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08699.pdf)
> When a person attempts to conceal an emotion, the genuine emotion is manifest as a micro-expression. Exploration of automatic facial micro-expression recognition systems is relatively new in the computer vision domain. This is due to the difficulty in implementing optimal feature extraction methods to cope with the subtlety and brief motion characteristics of the expression. Most of the existing approaches extract the subtle facial movements based on hand-crafted features. In this paper, we address the micro-expression recognition task with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which well integrates the features extracted from each video. A new feature descriptor, Optical Flow Features from Apex frame Network (OFF-ApexNet) is introduced. This feature descriptor combines the optical ow guided context with the CNN. Firstly, we obtain the location of the apex frame from each video sequence as it portrays the highest intensity of facial motion among all frames. Then, the optical ow information are attained from the apex frame and a reference frame (i.e., onset frame). Finally, the optical flow features are fed into a pre-designed CNN model for further feature enhancement as well as to carry out the expression classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of OFF-ApexNet, comprehensive evaluations are conducted on three public spontaneous micro-expression datasets (i.e., SMIC, CASME II and SAMM). The promising recognition result suggests that the proposed method can optimally describe the significant micro-expression details. In particular, we report that, in a multi-database with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation experimental protocol, the recognition performance reaches 74.60% of recognition accuracy and F-measure of 71.04%. We also note that this is the first work that performs cross-dataset validation on three databases in this domain. 
### 434.Evaluating ResNeXt Model Architecture for Image Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08700.pdf)
> In recent years, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to image classification tasks. Many such deep neural networks exist today that can easily differentiate cats from dogs. One such model is the ResNeXt model that uses a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture for image classification. This paper aims at implementing and evaluating the ResNeXt model architecture on subsets of the CIFAR-10 dataset. It also tweaks the original ResNeXt hyper-parameters such as cardinality, depth and base-width and compares the performance of the modified model with the original. Analysis of the experiments performed in this paper show that a slight decrease in depth or base-width does not affect the performance of the model much leading to comparable results. 
### 435.ScaffoldNet: Detecting and Classifying Biomedical Polymer-Based  Scaffolds via a Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08702.pdf)
> We developed a Convolutional Neural Network model to identify and classify Airbrushed (alternatively known as Blow-spun), Electrospun and Steel Wire scaffolds. Our model ScaffoldNet is a 6-layer Convolutional Neural Network trained and tested on 3,043 images of Airbrushed, Electrospun and Steel Wire scaffolds. The model takes in as input an imaged scaffold and then outputs the scaffold type (Airbrushed, Electrospun or Steel Wire) as predicted probabilities for the 3 classes. Our model scored a 99.44% Accuracy, demonstrating potential for adaptation to investigating and solving complex machine learning problems aimed at abstract spatial contexts, or in screening complex, biological, fibrous structures seen in cortical bone and fibrous shells. 
### 436.Fast Symbolic 3D Registration Solution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08703.pdf)
> 3D registration has always been performed invoking singular value decomposition (SVD) or eigenvalue decomposition (EIG) in real engineering practices. However, numerical algorithms suffer from uncertainty of convergence in many cases. A novel fast symbolic solution is proposed in this paper by following our recent publication in this journal. The equivalence analysis shows that our previous solver can be converted to deal with the 3D registration problem. Rather, the computation procedure is studied for further simplification of computing without complex numbers support. Experimental results show that the proposed solver does not loose accuracy and robustness but improves the execution speed to a large extent by almost \%50 to \%80, on both personal computer and embedded processor. 
### 437.Replicating Active Appearance Model by Generator Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08704.pdf)
> A recent Cell paper [Chang and Tsao, 2017] reports an interesting discovery. For the face stimuli generated by a pre-trained active appearance model (AAM), the responses of neurons in the areas of the primate brain that are responsible for face recognition exhibit strong linear relationship with the shape variables and appearance variables of the AAM that generates the face stimuli. In this paper, we show that this behavior can be replicated by a deep generative model called the generator network, which assumes that the observed signals are generated by latent random variables via a top-down convolutional neural network. Specifically, we learn the generator network from the face images generated by a pre-trained AAM model using variational auto-encoder, and we show that the inferred latent variables of the learned generator network have strong linear relationship with the shape and appearance variables of the AAM model that generates the face images. Unlike the AAM model that has an explicit shape model where the shape variables generate the control points or landmarks, the generator network has no such shape model and shape variables. Yet the generator network can learn the shape knowledge in the sense that some of the latent variables of the learned generator network capture the shape variations in the face images generated by AAM. 
### 438.Semantic Cluster Unary Loss for Efficient Deep Hashing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08705.pdf)
> Hashing method maps similar data to binary hashcodes with smaller hamming distance, which has received a broad attention due to its low storage cost and fast retrieval speed. With the rapid development of deep learning, deep hashing methods have achieved promising results in efficient information retrieval. Most of the existing deep hashing methods adopt pairwise or triplet losses to deal with similarities underlying the data, but the training is difficult and less efficient because $O(n^2)$ data pairs and $O(n^3)$ triplets are involved. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep hashing algorithm with unary loss which can be trained very efficiently. We first of all introduce a Unary Upper Bound of the traditional triplet loss, thus reducing the complexity to $O(n)$ and bridging the classification-based unary loss and the triplet loss. Second, we propose a novel Semantic Cluster Deep Hashing (SCDH) algorithm by introducing a modified Unary Upper Bound loss, named Semantic Cluster Unary Loss (SCUL). The resultant hashcodes form several compact clusters, which means hashcodes in the same cluster have similar semantic information. We also demonstrate that the proposed SCDH is easy to be extended to semi-supervised settings by incorporating the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art hashing algorithms. 
### 439.Automatic Data Registration of Geostationary Payloads for Meteorological  Applications at ISRO [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08706.pdf)
> The launch of KALPANA-1 satellite in the year 2002 heralded the establishment of an indigenous operational payload for meteorological predictions. This was further enhanced in the year 2003 with the launching of INSAT-3A satellite. The software for generating products from the data of these two satellites was taken up subsequently in the year 2004 and the same was installed at the Indian Meteorological Department, New Delhi in January 2006. Registration has been one of the most fundamental operations to generate almost all the data products from the remotely sensed data. Registration is a challenging task due to inevitable radiometric and geometric distortions during the acquisition process. Besides the presence of clouds makes the problem more complicated. In this paper, we present an algorithm for multitemporal and multiband registration. In addition, India facing reference boundaries for the CCD data of INSAT-3A have also been generated. The complete implementation is made up of the following steps: 1) automatic identification of the ground control points (GCPs) in the sensed data, 2) finding the optimal transformation model based on the match-points, and 3) resampling the transformed imagery to the reference coordinates. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated using the real datasets from KALPANA-1 and INSAT-3A. Both KALAPANA-1 and INSAT-3A have recently been decommissioned due to lack of fuel, however, the experience gained from them have given rise to a series of meteorological satellites and associated software; like INSAT-3D series which give continuous weather forecasting for the country. This paper is not so much focused on the theory (widely available in the literature) but concentrates on the implementation of operational software. 
### 440.A Simple Cache Model for Image Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08709.pdf)
> Training large-scale image recognition models is computationally expensive. This raises the question of whether there might be simple ways to improve the test performance of an already trained model without having to re-train or even fine-tune it with new data. Here, we show that, surprisingly, this is indeed possible. The key observation we make is that the layers of a deep network close to the output layer contain independent, easily extractable class-relevant information that is not contained in the output layer itself. We propose to extract this extra class-relevant information using a simple key-value cache memory to improve the classification performance of the model at test time. Our cache memory is directly inspired by a similar cache model previously proposed for language modeling (Grave et al., 2017). This cache component does not require any training or fine-tuning; it can be applied to any pre-trained model and, by properly setting only two hyper-parameters, leads to significant improvements in its classification performance. Improvements are observed across several architectures and datasets. In the cache component, using features extracted from layers close to the output (but not from the output layer itself) as keys leads to the largest improvements. Concatenating features from multiple layers to form keys can further improve performance over using single-layer features as keys. The cache component also has a regularizing effect, a simple consequence of which is that it substantially increases the robustness of models against adversarial attacks. 
### 441.Automatic Adaptation of Person Association for Multiview Tracking in  Group Activities [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08717.pdf)
> Reliable markerless motion tracking of multiple people participating in complex group activity from multiple handheld cameras is challenging due to frequent occlusions, strong viewpoint and appearance variations, and asynchronous video streams. The key to solving this problem is to reliably associate the same person across distant viewpoint and temporal instances. In this work, we combine motion tracking, mutual exclusion constraints, and multiview geometry in a multitask learning framework to automatically adapt a generic person appearance descriptor to the domain videos. Tracking is formulated as a spatiotemporally constrained clustering using the adapted person descriptor. Physical human constraints are exploited to reconstruct accurate and consistent 3D skeletons for every person across the entire sequence. We show significant improvement in association accuracy (up to 18%) in events with up to 60 people and 3D human skeleton reconstruction (5 to 10 times) over the baseline for events captured "in the wild". 
### 442.CascadeCNN: Pushing the performance limits of quantisation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08743.pdf)
> This work presents CascadeCNN, an automated toolflow that pushes the quantisation limits of any given CNN model, to perform high-throughput inference by exploiting the computation time-accuracy trade-off. Without the need for retraining, a two-stage architecture tailored for any given FPGA device is generated, consisting of a low- and a high-precision unit. A confidence evaluation unit is employed between them to identify misclassified cases at run time and forward them to the high-precision unit or terminate computation. Experiments demonstrate that CascadeCNN achieves a performance boost of up to 55% for VGG-16 and 48% for AlexNet over the baseline design for the same resource budget and accuracy. 
### 443.A Convolutional Feature Map based Deep Network targeted towards Traffic  Detection and Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08769.pdf)
> This research mainly emphasizes on traffic detection thus essentially involving object detection and classification. The particular work discussed here is motivated from unsatisfactory attempts of re-using well known pre-trained object detection networks for domain specific data. In this course, some trivial issues leading to prominent performance drop are identified and ways to resolve them are discussed. For example, some simple yet relevant tricks regarding data collection and sampling prove to be very beneficial. Also, introducing a blur net to deal with blurred real time data is another important factor promoting performance elevation. We further study the neural network design issues for beneficial object classification and involve shared, region-independent convolutional features. Adaptive learning rates to deal with saddle points are also investigated and an average covariance matrix based pre-conditioned approach is proposed. We also introduce the use of optical flow features to accommodate orientation information. Experimental results demonstrate that this results in a steady rise in the performance rate. 
### 444.A scene perception system for visually impaired based on object  detection and classification using multi-modal DCNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08798.pdf)
> This paper represents a cost-effective scene perception system aimed towards visually impaired individual. We use an odroid system integrated with an USB camera and USB laser that can be attached on the chest. The system classifies the detected objects along with its distance from the user and provides a voice output. Experimental results provided in this paper use outdoor traffic scenes. The object detection and classification framework exploits a multi-modal fusion based faster RCNN using motion, sharpening and blurring filters for efficient feature representation. 
### 445.Multi-View Graph Convolutional Network and Its Applications on  Neuroimage Analysis for Parkinson&#x27;s Disease [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08801.pdf)
> Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases that affects tens of millions of Americans. PD is highly progressive and heterogeneous. Quite a few studies have been conducted in recent years on predictive or disease progression modeling of PD using clinical and biomarkers data. Neuroimaging, as another important information source for neurodegenerative disease, has also arisen considerable interests from the PD community. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for fusing multiple modalities of brain images in relationship prediction which is useful for distinguishing PD cases from controls. On Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, our approach achieved $0.9537\pm 0.0587$ AUC, compared with $0.6443\pm 0.0223$ AUC achieved by traditional approaches such as PCA. 
### 446.Resource Aware Person Re-identification across Multiple Resolutions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08805.pdf)
> Not all people are equally easy to identify: color statistics might be enough for some cases while others might require careful reasoning about high- and low-level details. However, prevailing person re-identification(re-ID) methods use one-size-fits-all high-level embeddings from deep convolutional networks for all cases. This might limit their accuracy on difficult examples or makes them needlessly expensive for the easy ones. To remedy this, we present a new person re-ID model that combines effective embeddings built on multiple convolutional network layers, trained with deep-supervision. On traditional re-ID benchmarks, our method improves substantially over the previous state-of-the-art results on all five datasets that we evaluate on. We then propose two new formulations of the person re-ID problem under resource-constraints, and show how our model can be used to effectively trade off accuracy and computation in the presence of resource constraints. 
### 447.Global-and-local attention networks for visual recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08819.pdf)
> State-of-the-art deep convolutional networks (DCNs) such as squeeze-and- excitation (SE) residual networks implement a form of attention, also known as contextual guidance, which is derived from global image features. Here, we explore a complementary form of attention, known as visual saliency, which is derived from local image features. We extend the SE module with a novel global-and-local attention (GALA) module which combines both forms of attention -- resulting in state-of-the-art accuracy on ILSVRC. We further describe ClickMe.ai, a large-scale online experiment designed for human participants to identify diagnostic image regions to co-train a GALA network. Adding humans-in-the-loop is shown to significantly improve network accuracy, while also yielding visual features that are more interpretable and more similar to those used by human observers. 
### 448.Distribution Matching Losses Can Hallucinate Features in Medical Image  Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08841.pdf)
> This paper discusses how distribution matching losses, such as those used in CycleGAN, when used to synthesize medical images can lead to mis-diagnosis of medical conditions. It seems appealing to use these new image synthesis methods for translating images from a source to a target domain because they can produce high quality images and some even do not require paired data. However, the basis of how these image translation models work is through matching the translation output to the distribution of the target domain. This can cause an issue when the data provided in the target domain has an over or under representation of some classes (e.g. healthy or sick). When the output of an algorithm is a transformed image there are uncertainties whether all known and unknown class labels have been preserved or changed. Therefore, we recommend that these translated images should not be used for direct interpretation (e.g. by doctors) because they may lead to misdiagnosis of patients based on hallucinated image features by an algorithm that matches a distribution. However there are many recent papers that seem as though this is the goal. 
### 449.Unsupervised Domain Adaptation using Regularized Hyper-graph Matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08874.pdf)
> Domain adaptation (DA) addresses the real-world image classification problem of discrepancy between training (source) and testing (target) data distributions. We propose an unsupervised DA method that considers the presence of only unlabelled data in the target domain. Our approach centers on finding matches between samples of the source and target domains. The matches are obtained by treating the source and target domains as hyper-graphs and carrying out a class-regularized hyper-graph matching using first-, second- and third-order similarities between the graphs. We have also developed a computationally efficient algorithm by initially selecting a subset of the samples to construct a graph and then developing a customized optimization routine for graph-matching based on Conditional Gradient and Alternating Direction Multiplier Method. This allows the proposed method to be used widely. We also performed a set of experiments on standard object recognition datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework over state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 450.Teacher&#x27;s Perception in the Classroom [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08897.pdf)
> The ability for a teacher to engage all students in active learning processes in classroom constitutes a crucial prerequisite for enhancing students achievement. Teachers' attentional processes provide important insights into teachers' ability to focus their attention on relevant information in the complexity of classroom interaction and distribute their attention across students in order to recognize the relevant needs for learning. In this context, mobile eye tracking is an innovative approach within teaching effectiveness research to capture teachers' attentional processes while teaching. However, analyzing mobile eye-tracking data by hand is time consuming and still limited. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to enhance the impact of mobile eye tracking by connecting it with computer vision. In mobile eye tracking videos from an educational study using a standardized small group situation, we apply a state-ofthe-art face detector, create face tracklets, and introduce a novel method to cluster faces into the number of identity. Subsequently, teachers' attentional focus is calculated per student during a teaching unit by associating eye tracking fixations and face tracklets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine computer vision and mobile eye tracking to model teachers' attention while instructing. 
### 451.AutoPruner: An End-to-End Trainable Filter Pruning Method for Efficient  Deep Model Inference [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08941.pdf)
> Channel pruning is an important family of methods to speedup deep model's inference. Previous filter pruning algorithms regard channel pruning and model fine-tuning as two independent steps. This paper argues that combining them in a single end-to-end trainable system will lead to better results. We propose an efficient channel selection layer, namely AutoPruner, to find less important filters automatically in a joint training manner. AutoPruner takes previous activation responses as input and generates a true binary index code for pruning. Hence, all the filters corresponding to zero index values can be removed safely after training. We empirically demonstrate that the gradient information of this channel selection layer is also helpful for the whole model training. Compared with previous state-of-the-art pruning algorithms, AutoPruner achieves significantly better performance. Furthermore, ablation experiments show that the proposed novel mini-batch pooling and binarization operations are vital for the success of filter pruning. 
### 452.Building Extraction at Scale using Convolutional Neural Network: Mapping  of the United States [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08946.pdf)
> Establishing up-to-date large scale building maps is essential to understand urban dynamics, such as estimating population, urban planning and many other applications. Although many computer vision tasks has been successfully carried out with deep convolutional neural networks, there is a growing need to understand their large scale impact on building mapping with remote sensing imagery. Taking advantage of the scalability of CNNs and using only few areas with the abundance of building footprints, for the first time we conduct a comparative analysis of four state-of-the-art CNNs for extracting building footprints across the entire continental United States. The four CNN architectures namely: branch-out CNN, fully convolutional neural network (FCN), conditional random field as recurrent neural network (CRFasRNN), and SegNet, support semantic pixel-wise labeling and focus on capturing textural information at multi-scale. We use 1-meter resolution aerial images from National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) as the test-bed, and compare the extraction results across the four methods. In addition, we propose to combine signed-distance labels with SegNet, the preferred CNN architecture identified by our extensive evaluations, to advance building extraction results to instance level. We further demonstrate the usefulness of fusing additional near IR information into the building extraction framework. Large scale experimental evaluations are conducted and reported using metrics that include: precision, recall rate, intersection over union, and the number of buildings extracted. With the improved CNN model and no requirement of further post-processing, we have generated building maps for the United States. The quality of extracted buildings and processing time demonstrated the proposed CNN-based framework fits the need of building extraction at scale. 
### 453.ICADx: Interpretable computer aided diagnosis of breast masses [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08960.pdf)
> In this study, a novel computer aided diagnosis (CADx) framework is devised to investigate interpretability for classifying breast masses. Recently, a deep learning technology has been successfully applied to medical image analysis including CADx. Existing deep learning based CADx approaches, however, have a limitation in explaining the diagnostic decision. In real clinical practice, clinical decisions could be made with reasonable explanation. So current deep learning approaches in CADx are limited in real world deployment. In this paper, we investigate interpretability in CADx with the proposed interpretable CADx (ICADx) framework. The proposed framework is devised with a generative adversarial network, which consists of interpretable diagnosis network and synthetic lesion generative network to learn the relationship between malignancy and a standardized description (BI-RADS). The lesion generative network and the interpretable diagnosis network compete in an adversarial learning so that the two networks are improved. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated on public mammogram database. Experimental results showed that the proposed ICADx framework could provide the interpretability of mass as well as mass classification. It was mainly attributed to the fact that the proposed method was effectively trained to find the relationship between malignancy and interpretations via the adversarial learning. These results imply that the proposed ICADx framework could be a promising approach to develop the CADx system. 
### 454.3D Human Pose Estimation with Relational Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08961.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel 3D human pose estimation algorithm from a single image based on neural networks. We adopted the structure of the relational networks in order to capture the relations among different body parts. In our method, each pair of different body parts generates features, and the average of the features from all the pairs are used for 3D pose estimation. In addition, we propose a dropout method that can be used in relational modules, which inherently imposes robustness to the occlusions. The proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance for 3D pose estimation in Human 3.6M dataset, and it effectively produces plausible results even in the existence of missing joints. 
### 455.Neural Network Interpretation via Fine Grained Textual Summarization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08969.pdf)
> Current visualization based network interpretation methodssuffer from lacking semantic-level information. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of interpreting classification models using fine grained textual summarization. Along with the label prediction, the network will generate a sentence explaining its decision. Constructing a fully annotated dataset of filter|text pairs is unrealistic because of image to filter response function complexity. We instead propose a weakly-supervised learning algorithm leveraging off-the-shelf image caption annotations. Central to our algorithm is the filter-level attribute probability density function (p.d.f.), learned as a conditional probability through Bayesian inference with the input image and its feature map as latent variables. We show our algorithm faithfully reflects the features learned by the model using rigorous applications like attribute based image retrieval and unsupervised text grounding. We further show that the textual summarization process can help in understanding network failure patterns and can provide clues for further improvements. 
### 456.DRPose3D: Depth Ranking in 3D Human Pose Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08973.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a two-stage depth ranking based method (DRPose3D) to tackle the problem of 3D human pose estimation. Instead of accurate 3D positions, the depth ranking can be identified by human intuitively and learned using the deep neural network more easily by solving classification problems. Moreover, depth ranking contains rich 3D information. It prevents the 2D-to-3D pose regression in two-stage methods from being ill-posed. In our method, firstly, we design a Pairwise Ranking Convolutional Neural Network (PRCNN) to extract depth rankings of human joints from images. Secondly, a coarse-to-fine 3D Pose Network(DPNet) is proposed to estimate 3D poses from both depth rankings and 2D human joint locations. Additionally, to improve the generality of our model, we introduce a statistical method to augment depth rankings. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the Human3.6M benchmark for all three testing protocols, indicating that depth ranking is an essential geometric feature which can be learned to improve the 3D pose estimation. 
### 457.Do Better ImageNet Models Transfer Better? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08974.pdf)
> Transfer learning has become a cornerstone of computer vision with the advent of ImageNet features, yet little work has been done to evaluate the performance of ImageNet architectures across different datasets. An implicit hypothesis in modern computer vision research is that models that perform better on ImageNet necessarily perform better on other vision tasks. However, this hypothesis has never been systematically tested. Here, we compare the performance of 13 classification models on 12 image classification tasks in three settings: as fixed feature extractors, fine-tuned, and trained from random initialization. We find that, when networks are used as fixed feature extractors, ImageNet accuracy is only weakly predictive of accuracy on other tasks ($r^2=0.24$). In this setting, ResNets consistently outperform networks that achieve higher accuracy on ImageNet. When networks are fine-tuned, we observe a substantially stronger correlation ($r^2 = 0.86$). We achieve state-of-the-art performance on eight image classification tasks simply by fine-tuning state-of-the-art ImageNet architectures, outperforming previous results based on specialized methods for transfer learning. Finally, we observe that, on three small fine-grained image classification datasets, networks trained from random initialization perform similarly to ImageNet-pretrained networks. Together, our results show that ImageNet architectures generalize well across datasets, with small improvements in ImageNet accuracy producing improvements across other tasks, but ImageNet features are less general than previously suggested. 
### 458.RGB-T Object Tracking:Benchmark and Baseline [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08982.pdf)
> RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) object tracking receives more and more attention due to the strongly complementary benefits of thermal information to visible data. However, RGB-T research is limited by lacking a comprehensive evaluation platform. In this paper, we propose a large-scale video benchmark dataset for RGB-T tracking.It has three major advantages over existing ones: 1) Its size is sufficiently large for large-scale performance evaluation (total frame number: 234K, maximum frame per sequence: 8K). 2) The alignment between RGB-T sequence pairs is highly accurate, which does not need pre- or post-processing. 3) The occlusion levels are annotated for occlusion-sensitive performance analysis of different tracking algorithms.Moreover, we propose a novel graph-based approach to learn a robust object representation for RGB-T tracking. In particular, the tracked object is represented with a graph with image patches as nodes. This graph including graph structure, node weights and edge weights is dynamically learned in a unified ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers)-based optimization framework, in which the modality weights are also incorporated for adaptive fusion of multiple source data.Extensive experiments on the large-scale dataset are executed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracker against other state-of-the-art tracking methods. We also provide new insights and potential research directions to the field of RGB-T object tracking. 
### 459.GPU Accelerated Cascade Hashing Image Matching for Large Scale 3D  Reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08995.pdf)
> Image feature point matching is a key step in Structure from Motion(SFM). However, it is becoming more and more time consuming because the number of images is getting larger and larger. In this paper, we proposed a GPU accelerated image matching method with improved Cascade Hashing. Firstly, we propose a Disk-Memory-GPU data exchange strategy and optimize the load order of data, so that the proposed method can deal with big data. Next, we parallelize the Cascade Hashing method on GPU. An improved parallel reduction and an improved parallel hashing ranking are proposed to fulfill this task. Finally, extensive experiments show that our image matching is about 20 times faster than SiftGPU on the same graphics card, nearly 100 times faster than the CPU CasHash method and hundreds of times faster than the CPU Kd-Tree based matching method. Further more, we introduce the epipolar constraint to the proposed method, and use the epipolar geometry to guide the feature matching procedure, which further reduces the matching cost. 
### 460.CNN+CNN: Convolutional Decoders for Image Captioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09019.pdf)
> Image captioning is a challenging task that combines the field of computer vision and natural language processing. A variety of approaches have been proposed to achieve the goal of automatically describing an image, and recurrent neural network (RNN) or long-short term memory (LSTM) based models dominate this field. However, RNNs or LSTMs cannot be calculated in parallel and ignore the underlying hierarchical structure of a sentence. In this paper, we propose a framework that only employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate captions. Owing to parallel computing, our basic model is around 3 times faster than NIC (an LSTM-based model) during training time, while also providing better results. We conduct extensive experiments on MSCOCO and investigate the influence of the model width and depth. Compared with LSTM-based models that apply similar attention mechanisms, our proposed models achieves comparable scores of BLEU-1,2,3,4 and METEOR, and higher scores of CIDEr. We also test our model on the paragraph annotation dataset, and get higher CIDEr score compared with hierarchical LSTMs 
### 461.Efficient Relaxations for Dense CRFs with Sparse Higher Order Potentials [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09028.pdf)
> Dense conditional random fields (CRFs) with Gaussian pairwise potentials have become a popular framework for modelling several problems in computer vision such as stereo correspondence and multi-class semantic segmentation. By modelling long-range interactions, dense CRFs provide a more detailed labelling compared to their sparse counterparts. Currently the state-of-the-art algorithm performs mean-field inference using a filter-based method to obtain accurate segmentations, but fails to provide strong theoretical guarantees on the quality of the solution. Whilst the underlying model of a dense CRF provides enough information to yield well defined segmentations, it lacks the richness introduced via higher order potentials. The mean-field inference strategy was also extended to incorporate higher order potentials, but again failed to obtain a bound on the quality of the solution. To this extent, we show that a dense CRF can be aggregated with sparse higher order potentials in a way that is amenable to continuous relaxations. We will then show that, by using a filter-based method, these continuous relaxations can be optimised efficiently using state-of-the-art algorithms. Specifically we will solve a quadratic programming (QP) relaxation using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and a linear programming (LP) relaxation by developing a proximal minimisation framework. By exploiting labelling consistency in the higher order potentials and utilising the filter-based method, we are able to formulate the above algorithms such that each iteration has a complexity linear in the number of classes and random variables. The experiments are performed on the standard publicly available MSRC data set and demonstrate the low energies achieved from the minimisation and the accuracy of the resulting segmentations. 
### 462.Saliency deep embedding for aurora image search [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09033.pdf)
> Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in the field of image search. However, the state-of-the-art algorithms are trained and tested for natural images captured with ordinary cameras. In this paper, we aim to explore a new search method for images captured with circular fisheye lens, especially the aurora images. To reduce the interference from uninformative regions and focus on the most interested regions, we propose a saliency proposal network (SPN) to replace the region proposal network (RPN) in the recent Mask R-CNN. In our SPN, the centers of the anchors are not distributed in a rectangular meshing manner, but exhibit spherical distortion. Additionally, the directions of the anchors are along the deformation lines perpendicular to the magnetic meridian, which perfectly accords with the imaging principle of circular fisheye lens. Extensive experiments are performed on the big aurora data, demonstrating the superiority of our method in both search accuracy and efficiency. 
### 463.Excitation Dropout: Encouraging Plasticity in Deep Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09092.pdf)
> We propose a guided dropout regularizer for deep networks based on the evidence of a network prediction: the firing of neurons in specific paths. In this work, we utilize the evidence at each neuron to determine the probability of dropout, rather than dropping out neurons uniformly at random as in standard dropout. In essence, we dropout with higher probability those neurons which contribute more to decision making at training time. This approach penalizes high saliency neurons that are most relevant for model prediction, i.e. those having stronger evidence. By dropping such high-saliency neurons, the network is forced to learn alternative paths in order to maintain loss minimization, resulting in a plasticity-like behavior, a characteristic of human brains too. We demonstrate better generalization ability, an increased utilization of network neurons, and a higher resilience to network compression using several metrics over four image/video recognition benchmarks. 
### 464.Image Restoration by Estimating Frequency Distribution of Local Patches [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09097.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a method to solve the image restoration problem, which tries to restore the details of a corrupted image, especially due to the loss caused by JPEG compression. We have treated an image in the frequency domain to explicitly restore the frequency components lost during image compression. In doing so, the distribution in the frequency domain is learned using the cross entropy loss. Unlike recent approaches, we have reconstructed the details of an image without using the scheme of adversarial training. Rather, the image restoration problem is treated as a classification problem to determine the frequency coefficient for each frequency band in an image patch. In this paper, we show that the proposed method effectively restores a JPEG-compressed image with more detailed high frequency components, making the restored image more vivid. 
### 465.Maize Haploid Identification via LSTM-CNN and Hyperspectral Imaging  Technology [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09105.pdf)
> Accurate and fast identification of seed cultivars is crucial to plant breeding, with accelerating breeding of new products and increasing its quality. In our study, the first attempt to design a high-accurate identification model of maize haploid seeds from diploid ones based on optimum waveband selection of the LSTM-CNN algorithm is realized via deep learning and hyperspectral imaging technology, with accuracy reaching 97% in the determining optimum waveband of 1367.6-1526.4nm. The verification of testing another cultivar achieved an accuracy of 93% in the same waveband. The model collected images of 256 wavebands of seeds in the spectral region of 862.9-1704.2nm. The high-noise waveband intervals were found and deleted by the LSTM. The optimum-data waveband intervals were determined by CNN's waveband-based detection. The optimum sample set for network training only accounted for 1/5 of total sample data. The accuracy was significantly higher than the full-waveband modeling or modeling of any other wavebands. Our study demonstrates that the proposed model has outstanding effect on maize haploid identification and it could be generalized to some extent. 
### 466.Image Captioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09137.pdf)
> This paper discusses and demonstrates the outcomes from our experimentation on Image Captioning. Image captioning is a much more involved task than image recognition or classification, because of the additional challenge of recognizing the interdependence between the objects/concepts in the image and the creation of a succinct sentential narration. Experiments on several labeled datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. As a toy application, we apply image captioning to create video captions, and we advance a few hypotheses on the challenges we encountered. 
### 467.Towards the first adversarially robust neural network model on MNIST [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09190.pdf)
> Despite much effort, deep neural networks remain highly susceptible to tiny input perturbations and even for MNIST, one of the most common toy datasets in computer vision, no neural network model exists for which the adversarial perturbations are large and make semantic sense to humans. We show that the widely recognized and by far most successful defense by Madry et al. (1) overfits on the L-infinity metric (it's highly susceptibility to L2 and L0 perturbations), (2) a simple defense based on binarization performs almost as well and (3) its adversarial perturbations make little sense to humans. These results suggest that MNIST is far from being solved in terms of adversarial robustness. We present a novel approach that performs analysis by synthesis using learned class-conditional data distributions. We go to great length to empirically evaluate our model using maximally effective adversarial attacks by (a) applying decision-based, score-based, gradient-based and transfer-based attacks for several different Lp norms, (b) by designing a new attack that exploits the structure of our defended model and (c) by devising a novel decision-based attack that seeks to minimize the number of perturbed pixels (L0). The results suggest that this approach yields state-of-the-art robustness on MNIST against L0, L2 and L-infinity perturbations and we demonstrate that most adversarial examples are strongly perturbed towards the perceptual boundary between the original and the adversarial class. 
### 468.Attributes in Multiple Facial Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09203.pdf)
> Facial attribute recognition is conventionally computed from a single image. In practice, each subject may have multiple face images. Taking the eye size as an example, it should not change, but it may have different estimation in multiple images, which would make a negative impact on face recognition. Thus, how to compute these attributes corresponding to each subject rather than each single image is a profound work. To address this question, we deploy deep training for facial attributes prediction, and we explore the inconsistency issue among the attributes computed from each single image. Then, we develop two approaches to address the inconsistency issue. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can handle facial attribute estimation on either multiple still images or video frames, and can correct the incorrectly annotated labels. The experiments are conducted on two large public databases with annotations of facial attributes. 
### 469.SymmSLIC: Symmetry Aware Superpixel Segmentation and its Applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09232.pdf)
> Over-segmentation of an image into superpixels has become a useful tool for solving various problems in image processing and computer vision. Reflection symmetry is quite prevalent in both natural and man-made objects and is an essential cue in understanding and grouping the objects in natural scenes. Existing algorithms for estimating superpixels do not preserve the reflection symmetry of an object which leads to different sizes and shapes of superpixels across the symmetry axis. In this work, we propose an algorithm to over-segment an image through the propagation of reflection symmetry evident at the pixel level to superpixel boundaries. In order to achieve this goal, we first find the reflection symmetry in the image and represent it by a set of pairs of pixels which are mirror reflections of each other. We partition the image into superpixels while preserving this reflection symmetry through an iterative algorithm. We compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art superpixel generation methods and show the effectiveness in preserving the size and shape of superpixel boundaries across the reflection symmetry axes. We also present two applications, symmetry axes detection and unsupervised symmetric object segmentation, to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 
### 470.Segmentation of Liver Lesions with Reduced Complexity Deep Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09233.pdf)
> We propose a computationally efficient architecture that learns to segment lesions from CT images of the liver. The proposed architecture uses bilinear interpolation with sub-pixel convolution at the last layer to upscale the course feature in bottle neck architecture. Since bilinear interpolation and sub-pixel convolution do not have any learnable parameter, our overall model is faster and occupies less memory footprint than the traditional U-net. We evaluate our proposed architecture on the highly competitive dataset of 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge. Our method achieves competitive results while reducing the number of learnable parameters roughly by a factor of 13.8 compared to the original UNet model. 
### 471.Subspace Clustering by Block Diagonal Representation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09243.pdf)
> This paper studies the subspace clustering problem. Given some data points approximately drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to group these data points into their underlying subspaces. Many subspace clustering methods have been proposed and among which sparse subspace clustering and low-rank representation are two representative ones. Despite the different motivations, we observe that many existing methods own the common block diagonal property, which possibly leads to correct clustering, yet with their proofs given case by case. In this work, we consider a general formulation and provide a unified theoretical guarantee of the block diagonal property. The block diagonal property of many existing methods falls into our special case. Second, we observe that many existing methods approximate the block diagonal representation matrix by using different structure priors, e.g., sparsity and low-rankness, which are indirect. We propose the first block diagonal matrix induced regularizer for directly pursuing the block diagonal matrix. With this regularizer, we solve the subspace clustering problem by Block Diagonal Representation (BDR), which uses the block diagonal structure prior. The BDR model is nonconvex and we propose an alternating minimization solver and prove its convergence. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BDR. 
### 472.Learning Illuminant Estimation from Object Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09264.pdf)
> In this paper we present a deep learning method to estimate the illuminant of an image. Our model is not trained with illuminant annotations, but with the objective of improving performance on an auxiliary task such as object recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a deep learning architecture for illuminant estimation that is trained without ground truth illuminants. We evaluate our solution on standard datasets for color constancy, and compare it with state of the art methods. Our proposal is shown to outperform most deep learning methods in a cross-dataset evaluation setup, and to present competitive results in a comparison with parametric solutions. 
### 473.WisenetMD: Motion Detection Using Dynamic Background Region Analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09277.pdf)
> Motion detection algorithms that can be applied to surveillance cameras such as CCTV (Closed Circuit Television) have been studied extensively. Motion detection algorithm is mostly based on background subtraction. One main issue in this technique is that false positives of dynamic backgrounds such as wind shaking trees and flowing rivers might occur. In this paper, we proposed a method to search for dynamic background region by analyzing the video and removing false positives by re-checking false positives. The proposed method was evaluated based on CDnet 2012/2014 dataset obtained at "changedetection.net" site. We also compared its processing speed with other algorithms. 
### 474.SNIPER: Efficient Multi-Scale Training [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09300.pdf)
> We present SNIPER, an algorithm for performing efficient multi-scale training in instance level visual recognition tasks. Instead of processing every pixel in an image pyramid, SNIPER processes context regions around ground-truth instances (referred to as chips) at the appropriate scale. For background sampling, these context-regions are generated using proposals extracted from a region proposal network trained with a short learning schedule. Hence, the number of chips generated per image during training adaptively changes based on the scene complexity. SNIPER only processes 30% more pixels compared to the commonly used single scale training at 800x1333 pixels on the COCO dataset. But, it also observes samples from extreme resolutions of the image pyramid, like 1400x2000 pixels. As SNIPER operates on resampled low resolution chips (512x512 pixels), it can have a batch size as large as 20 on a single GPU even with a ResNet-101 backbone. Therefore it can benefit from batch-normalization during training without the need for synchronizing batch-normalization statistics across GPUs. SNIPER brings training of instance level recognition tasks like object detection closer to the protocol for image classification and suggests that the commonly accepted guideline that it is important to train on high resolution images for instance level visual recognition tasks might not be correct. Our implementation based on Faster-RCNN with a ResNet-101 backbone obtains an mAP of 47.6% on the COCO dataset for bounding box detection and can process 5 images per second with a single GPU. The code is available at <a href="https://github.com/MahyarNajibi/SNIPER.">this https URL</a> 
### 475.Anonymizing k-Facial Attributes via Adversarial Perturbations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09380.pdf)
> A face image not only provides details about the identity of a subject but also reveals several attributes such as gender, race, sexual orientation, and age. Advancements in machine learning algorithms and popularity of sharing images on the World Wide Web, including social media websites, have increased the scope of data analytics and information profiling from photo collections. This poses a serious privacy threat for individuals who do not want to be profiled. This research presents a novel algorithm for anonymizing selective attributes which an individual does not want to share without affecting the visual quality of images. Using the proposed algorithm, a user can select single or multiple attributes to be surpassed while preserving identity information and visual content. The proposed adversarial perturbation based algorithm embeds imperceptible noise in an image such that attribute prediction algorithm for the selected attribute yields incorrect classification result, thereby preserving the information according to user's choice. Experiments on three popular databases i.e. MUCT, LFWcrop, and CelebA show that the proposed algorithm not only anonymizes k-attributes, but also preserves image quality and identity information. 
### 476.Classifying cooking object&#x27;s state using a tuned VGG convolutional  neural network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09391.pdf)
> In robotics, knowing the object states and recognizing the desired states are very important. Objects at different states would require different grasping. To achieve different states, different manipulations would be required, as well as different grasping. To analyze the objects at different states, a dataset of cooking objects was created. Cooking consists of various cutting techniques needed for different dishes (e.g. diced, julienne etc.). Identifying each of this state of cooking objects by the human can be difficult sometimes too. In this paper, we have analyzed seven different cooking object states by tuning a convolutional neural network (CNN). For this task, images were downloaded and annotated by students and they are divided into training and a completely different test set. By tuning the vgg-16 CNN 77% accuracy was obtained. The work presented in this paper focuses on classification between various object states rather than task recognition or recipe prediction. This framework can be easily adapted in any other object state classification activity. 
### 477.A hybrid approach of interpolations and CNN to obtain super-resolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09400.pdf)
> We propose a novel architecture that learns an end-to-end mapping function to improve the spatial resolution of the input natural images. The model is unique in forming a nonlinear combination of three traditional interpolation techniques using the convolutional neural network. Another proposed architecture uses a skip connection with nearest neighbor interpolation, achieving almost similar results. The architectures have been carefully designed to ensure that the reconstructed images lie precisely in the manifold of high-resolution images, thereby preserving the high-frequency components with fine details. We have compared with the state of the art and recent deep learning based natural image super-resolution techniques and found that our methods are able to preserve the sharp details in the image, while also obtaining comparable or better PSNR than them. Since our methods use only traditional interpolations and a shallow CNN with less number of smaller filters, the computational cost is kept low. We have reported the results of two proposed architectures on five standard datasets, for an upscale factor of 2. Our methods generalize well in most cases, which is evident from the better results obtained with increasingly complex datasets. For 4-times upscaling, we have designed similar architectures for comparing with other methods. 
### 478.Non-convex non-local flows for saliency detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09408.pdf)
> We propose and numerically solve a new variational model for automatic saliency detection in digital images. Using a non-local framework we consider a family of edge preserving functions combined with a new quadratic saliency detection term. Such term defines a constrained bilateral obstacle problem for image classification driven by p-Laplacian operators, including the so-called hyper-Laplacian case (0 &lt; p &lt; 1). The related non-convex non-local reactive flows are then considered and applied for glioblastoma segmentation in magnetic resonance fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (MRI-Flair) images. A fast convolutional kernel based approximated solution is computed. The numerical experiments show how the non-convexity related to the hyperLaplacian operators provides monotonically better results in terms of the standard metrics. 
### 479.Use of symmetric kernels for convolutional neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09421.pdf)
> At this work we introduce horizontally symmetric convolutional kernels for CNNs which make the network output invariant to horizontal flips of the image. We also study other types of symmetric kernels which lead to vertical flip invariance, and approximate rotational invariance. We show that usage of such kernels acts as regularizer, and improves generalization of the convolutional neural networks at the cost of more complicated training process. 
### 480.A Two-Stage Subspace Trust Region Approach for Deep Neural Network  Training [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09430.pdf)
> In this paper, we develop a novel second-order method for training feed-forward neural nets. At each iteration, we construct a quadratic approximation to the cost function in a low-dimensional subspace. We minimize this approximation inside a trust region through a two-stage procedure: first inside the embedded positive curvature subspace, followed by a gradient descent step. This approach leads to a fast objective function decay, prevents convergence to saddle points, and alleviates the need for manually tuning parameters. We show the good performance of the proposed algorithm on benchmark datasets. 
### 481.Implicit Language Model in LSTM for OCR [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09441.pdf)
> Neural networks have become the technique of choice for OCR, but many aspects of how and why they deliver superior performance are still unknown. One key difference between current neural network techniques using LSTMs and the previous state-of-the-art HMM systems is that HMM systems have a strong independence assumption. In comparison LSTMs have no explicit constraints on the amount of context that can be considered during decoding. In this paper we show that they learn an implicit LM and attempt to characterize the strength of the LM in terms of equivalent n-gram context. We show that this implicitly learned language model provides a 2.4\% CER improvement on our synthetic test set when compared against a test set of random characters (i.e. not naturally occurring sequences), and that the LSTM learns to use up to 5 characters of context (which is roughly 88 frames in our configuration). We believe that this is the first ever attempt at characterizing the strength of the implicit LM in LSTM based OCR systems. 
### 482.Complex Relations in a Deep Structured Prediction Model for Fine Image  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09462.pdf)
> Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to carry out inference over an image. These models typically involve unary potentials based on local appearance features computed by FCNs, and binary potentials based on the displacement between pixels. We show that while current methods succeed in segmenting whole objects, they perform poorly in situations involving a large number of object parts. We therefore suggest incorporating into the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the way humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were shown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment - into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal VOC Parts dataset. Our experimental results show that the segmentation of fine parts is positively affected by the addition of these two relations, and that the segmentation of fine parts can be further influenced by complex structural features. 
### 483.VisualBackProp for learning using privileged information with CNNs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09474.pdf)
> In many machine learning applications, from medical diagnostics to autonomous driving, the availability of prior knowledge can be used to improve the predictive performance of learning algorithms and incorporate `physical,' `domain knowledge,' or `common sense' concepts into training of machine learning systems as well as verify constraints/properties of the systems. We explore the learning using privileged information paradigm and show how to incorporate the privileged information, such as segmentation mask available along with the classification label of each example, into the training stage of convolutional neural networks. This is done by augmenting the CNN model with an architectural component that effectively focuses model's attention on the desired region of the input image during the training process and that is transparent to the network's label prediction mechanism at testing. This component effectively corresponds to the visualization strategy for identifying the parts of the input, often referred to as visualization mask, that most contribute to the prediction, yet uses this strategy in reverse to the classical setting in order to enforce the desired visualization mask instead. We verify our proposed algorithms through exhaustive experiments on benchmark ImageNet and PASCAL VOC data sets and achieve improvements in the performance of $2.4\%$ and $2.7\%$ over standard single-supervision model training. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of our approach on skin lesion classification problem. 
### 484.AutoAugment: Learning Augmentation Policies from Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09501.pdf)
> In this paper, we take a closer look at data augmentation for images, and describe a simple procedure called AutoAugment to search for improved data augmentation policies. Our key insight is to create a search space of data augmentation policies, evaluating the quality of a particular policy directly on the dataset of interest. In our implementation, we have designed a search space where a policy consists of many sub-policies, one of which is randomly chosen for each image in each mini-batch. A sub-policy consists of two operations, each operation being an image processing function such as translation, rotation, or shearing, and the probabilities and magnitudes with which the functions are applied. We use a search algorithm to find the best policy such that the neural network yields the highest validation accuracy on a target dataset. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet (without additional data). On ImageNet, we attain a Top-1 accuracy of 83.54%. On CIFAR-10, we achieve an error rate of 1.48%, which is 0.65% better than the previous state-of-the-art. On reduced data settings, AutoAugment performs comparably to semi-supervised methods without using any unlabeled examples. Finally, policies learned from one dataset can be transferred to work well on other similar datasets. For example, the policy learned on ImageNet allows us to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the fine grained visual classification dataset Stanford Cars, without fine-tuning weights pre-trained on additional data. 
### 485.Estimating Carotid Pulse and Breathing Rate from Near-infrared Video of  the Neck [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09511.pdf)
> Objective: Non-contact physiological measurement is a growing research area that allows capturing vital signs such as heart rate (HR) and breathing rate (BR) comfortably and unobtrusively with remote devices. However, most of the approaches work only in bright environments in which subtle photoplethysmographic and ballistocardiographic signals can be easily analyzed and/or require expensive and custom hardware to perform the measurements. <br />Approach: This work introduces a low-cost method to measure subtle motions associated with the carotid pulse and breathing movement from the neck using near-infrared (NIR) video imaging. A skin reflection model of the neck was established to provide a theoretical foundation for the method. In particular, the method relies on template matching for neck detection, Principal Component Analysis for feature extraction, and Hidden Markov Models for data smoothing. <br />Main Results: We compared the estimated HR and BR measures with ones provided by an FDA-cleared device in a 12-participant laboratory study: the estimates achieved a mean absolute error of 0.36 beats per minute and 0.24 breaths per minute under both bright and dark lighting. <br />Significance: This work advances the possibilities of non-contact physiological measurement in real-life conditions in which environmental illumination is limited and in which the face of the person is not readily available or needs to be protected. Due to the increasing availability of NIR imaging devices, the described methods are readily scalable. 
### 486.You Only Look Twice: Rapid Multi-Scale Object Detection In Satellite  Imagery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09512.pdf)
> Detection of small objects in large swaths of imagery is one of the primary problems in satellite imagery analytics. While object detection in ground-based imagery has benefited from research into new deep learning approaches, transitioning such technology to overhead imagery is nontrivial. Among the challenges is the sheer number of pixels and geographic extent per image: a single DigitalGlobe satellite image encompasses &gt;64 km2 and over 250 million pixels. Another challenge is that objects of interest are minuscule (often only ~10 pixels in extent), which complicates traditional computer vision techniques. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline (You Only Look Twice, or YOLT) that evaluates satellite images of arbitrary size at a rate of &gt;0.5 km2/s. The proposed approach can rapidly detect objects of vastly different scales with relatively little training data over multiple sensors. We evaluate large test images at native resolution, and yield scores of F1 &gt; 0.8 for vehicle localization. We further explore resolution and object size requirements by systematically testing the pipeline at decreasing resolution, and conclude that objects only ~5 pixels in size can still be localized with high confidence. Code is available at <a href="https://github.com/CosmiQ/yolt.">this https URL</a> 
### 487.AVID: Adversarial Visual Irregularity Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09521.pdf)
> Real-time detection of irregularities in visual data is very invaluable and useful in many prospective applications including surveillance, patient monitoring systems, etc. With the surge of deep learning methods in the recent years, researchers have tried a wide spectrum of methods for different applications. However, for the case of irregularity or anomaly detection in videos, training an end-to-end model is still an open challenge, since often irregularity is not well-defined and there are not enough irregular samples to use during training. In this paper, inspired by the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for training deep models in unsupervised or self-supervised settings, we propose an end-to-end deep network for detection and fine localization of irregularities in videos (and images). Our proposed architecture is composed of two networks, which are trained in competing with each other while collaborating to find the irregularity. One network works as a pixel-level irregularity Inpainter, and the other works as a patch-level Detector. After an adversarial self-supervised training, in which I tries to fool D into accepting its inpainted output as regular (normal), the two networks collaborate to detect and fine-segment the irregularity in any given testing video. Our results on three different datasets show that our method can outperform the state-of-the-art and fine-segment the irregularity. 
### 488.Coarse-to-fine Seam Estimation for Image Stitching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09578.pdf)
> Seam-cutting and seam-driven techniques have been proven effective for handling imperfect image series in image stitching. Generally, seam-driven is to utilize seam-cutting to find a best seam from one or finite alignment hypotheses based on a predefined seam quality metric. However, the quality metrics in most methods are defined to measure the average performance of the pixels on the seam without considering the relevance and variance among them. This may cause that the seam with the minimal measure is not optimal (perception-inconsistent) in human perception. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine seam estimation method which applies the evaluation in a different way. For pixels on the seam, we develop a patch-point evaluation algorithm concentrating more on the correlation and variation of them. The evaluations are then used to recalculate the difference map of the overlapping region and reestimate a stitching seam. This evaluation-reestimation procedure iterates until the current seam changes negligibly comparing with the previous seams. Experiments show that our proposed method can finally find a nearly perception-consistent seam after several iterations, which outperforms the conventional seam-cutting and other seam-driven methods. 
### 489.Residual Networks as Geodesic Flows of Diffeomorphisms [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09585.pdf)
> This paper addresses the understanding and characterization of residual networks (ResNet), which are among the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for a variety of supervised learning problems. We focus on the mapping component of ResNets, which map the embedding space towards a new unknown space where the prediction or classification can be stated according to linear criteria. We show that this mapping component can be regarded as the numerical implementation of continuous flows of diffeomorphisms governed by ordinary differential equations. Especially, ResNets with shared weights are fully characterized as numerical approximation of exponential diffeomorphic operators. We stress both theoretically and numerically the relevance of the enforcement of diffeormorphic properties and the importance of numerical issues to make consistent the continuous formulation and the discretized ResNet implementation. We further discuss the resulting theoretical and computational insights on ResNet architectures. 
### 490.Multi-Scale DenseNet-Based Electricity Theft Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09591.pdf)
> Electricity theft detection issue has drawn lots of attention during last decades. Timely identification of the electricity theft in the power system is crucial for the safety and availability of the system. Although sustainable efforts have been made, the detection task remains challenging and falls short of accuracy and efficiency, especially with the increase of the data size. Recently, convolutional neural network-based methods have achieved better performance in comparison with traditional methods, which employ handcrafted features and shallow-architecture classifiers. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatic detection by using a multi-scale dense connected convolution neural network (multi-scale DenseNet) in order to capture the long-term and short-term periodic features within the sequential data. We compare the proposed approaches with the classical algorithms, and the experimental results demonstrate that the multiscale DenseNet approach can significantly improve the accuracy of the detection. Moreover, our method is scalable, enabling larger data processing while no handcrafted feature engineering is needed. 
### 491.SOSELETO: A Unified Approach to Transfer Learning and Training with  Noisy Labels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09622.pdf)
> We present SOSELETO (SOurce SELEction for Target Optimization), a new method for exploiting a source dataset to solve a classification problem on a target dataset. SOSELETO is based on the following simple intuition: some source examples are more informative than others for the target problem. To capture this intuition, source samples are each given weights; these weights are solved for jointly with the source and target classification problems via a bilevel optimization scheme. The target therefore gets to choose the source samples which are most informative for its own classification task. Furthermore, the bilevel nature of the optimization acts as a kind of regularization on the target, mitigating overfitting. SOSELETO may be applied to both classic transfer learning, as well as the problem of training on datasets with noisy labels; we show state of the art results on both of these problems. 
### 492.LF-Net: Learning Local Features from Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09662.pdf)
> We present a novel deep architecture and a training strategy to learn a local feature pipeline from scratch, using collections of images without the need for human supervision. To do so we exploit depth and relative camera pose cues to create a virtual target that the network should achieve on one image, provided the outputs of the network for the other image. While this process is inherently non-differentiable, we show that we can optimize the network in a two-branch setup by confining it to one branch, while preserving differentiability in the other. We train our method on both indoor and outdoor datasets, with depth data from 3D sensors for the former, and depth estimates from an off-the-shelf Structure-from-Motion solution for the latter. Our models outperform the state of the art on sparse feature matching on both datasets, while running at 60+ fps for QVGA images. 
### 493.R-VQA: Learning Visual Relation Facts with Semantic Attention for Visual  Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09701.pdf)
> Recently, Visual Question Answering (VQA) has emerged as one of the most significant tasks in multimodal learning as it requires understanding both visual and textual modalities. Existing methods mainly rely on extracting image and question features to learn their joint feature embedding via multimodal fusion or attention mechanism. Some recent studies utilize external VQA-independent models to detect candidate entities or attributes in images, which serve as semantic knowledge complementary to the VQA task. However, these candidate entities or attributes might be unrelated to the VQA task and have limited semantic capacities. To better utilize semantic knowledge in images, we propose a novel framework to learn visual relation facts for VQA. Specifically, we build up a Relation-VQA (R-VQA) dataset based on the Visual Genome dataset via a semantic similarity module, in which each data consists of an image, a corresponding question, a correct answer and a supporting relation fact. A well-defined relation detector is then adopted to predict visual question-related relation facts. We further propose a multi-step attention model composed of visual attention and semantic attention sequentially to extract related visual knowledge and semantic knowledge. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the two benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and verifying the benefit of considering visual relation facts. 
### 494.Jointly Optimize Data Augmentation and Network Training: Adversarial  Data Augmentation in Human Pose Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09707.pdf)
> Random data augmentation is a critical technique to avoid overfitting in training deep neural network models. However, data augmentation and network training are usually treated as two isolated processes, limiting the effectiveness of network training. Why not jointly optimize the two? We propose adversarial data augmentation to address this limitation. The main idea is to design an augmentation network (generator) that competes against a target network (discriminator) by generating `hard' augmentation operations online. The augmentation network explores the weaknesses of the target network, while the latter learns from `hard' augmentations to achieve better performance. We also design a reward/penalty strategy for effective joint training. We demonstrate our approach on the problem of human pose estimation and carry out a comprehensive experimental analysis, showing that our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art models without additional data efforts. 
### 495.Image-to-image translation for cross-domain disentanglement [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09730.pdf)
> Deep image translation methods have recently shown excellent results, outputting high-quality images covering multiple modes of the data distribution. There has also been increased interest in disentangling the internal representations learned by deep methods to further improve their performance and achieve a finer control. In this paper, we bridge these two objectives and introduce the concept of cross-domain disentanglement. We aim to separate the internal representation into three parts. The shared part contains information for both domains. The exclusive parts, on the other hand, contain only factors of variation that are particular to each domain. We achieve this through bidirectional image translation based on Generative Adversarial Networks and cross-domain autoencoders, a novel network component. The obtained model offers multiple advantages. We can output diverse samples covering multiple modes of the distributions of both domains. We can perform cross-domain retrieval without the need of labeled data. Finally, we can perform domain-specific image transfer and interpolation. We compare our model to the state-of-the-art in multi-modal image translation and achieve better results. 
### 496.Mobile Face Tracking: A Survey and Benchmark [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09749.pdf)
> With the rapid development of smartphones, facial analysis has been playing an increasingly important role in a multitude of mobile applications. In most scenarios, face tracking serves as a crucial first step because more often than not, a mobile application would only need to focus on analysing a specific face in a complex setting. Albeit inheriting many commons traits of the generic visual tracking problem, face tracking in mobile scenarios is characterised by a unique set of challenges. In this work, we propose iBUG MobiFace benchmark, the first mobile face tracking benchmark consisting of 50 sequences captured by smartphone users in unconstrained environments. The sequences contain a total of 50,736 frames with 46 distinct identities to be tracked. The tracking target in each sequence is selected with varying difficulties in mobile scenarios. In addition to frame by frame bounding box, the annotations of 9 sequence attributes(e.g. multiple faces) are provided. We further provide a survey of 23 state-of-the-art visual trackers and a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of these methods on the proposed benchmark. In particular, trackers from two most popular frameworks, namely, correlation filter-based tracking and deep learning-based tracking, are studied. Our experiment shows that (a) the performance of all existing generic object trackers drops significantly on the mobile face tracking scenario, suggesting the need of more research effort into mobile face tracking, and (b) the effective combination of deep learning tracking and face-related algorithms(e.g. face detection) provides the most promising basis for future developments in the field. The database, annotations and evaluation protocol/code will be made publicly available on the iBUG website. 
### 497.Adversarial Collaboration: Joint Unsupervised Learning of Depth, Camera  Motion, Optical Flow and Motion Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09806.pdf)
> We address the unsupervised learning of several interconnected problems in low-level vision: single view depth prediction, camera motion estimation, optical flow and segmentation of a video into the static scene and moving regions. Our key insight is that these four fundamental vision problems are coupled and, consequently, learning to solve them together simplifies the problem because the solutions can reinforce each other by exploiting known geometric constraints. In order to model geometric constraints, we introduce Adversarial Collaboration, a framework that facilitates competition and collaboration between neural networks. We go beyond previous work by exploiting geometry more explicitly and segmenting the scene into static and moving regions. Adversarial Collaboration works much like expectation-maximization but with neural networks that act as adversaries, competing to explain pixels that correspond to static or moving regions, and as collaborators through a moderator that assigns pixels to be either static or independently moving. Our novel method integrates all these problems in a common framework and simultaneously reasons about the segmentation of the scene into moving objects and the static background, the camera motion, depth of the static scene structure, and the optical flow of moving objects. Our model is trained without any supervision and achieves state of the art results amongst unsupervised methods. 
### 498.Stereo Magnification: Learning View Synthesis using Multiplane Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09817.pdf)
> The view synthesis problem--generating novel views of a scene from known imagery--has garnered recent attention due in part to compelling applications in virtual and augmented reality. In this paper, we explore an intriguing scenario for view synthesis: extrapolating views from imagery captured by narrow-baseline stereo cameras, including VR cameras and now-widespread dual-lens camera phones. We call this problem stereo magnification, and propose a learning framework that leverages a new layered representation that we call multiplane images (MPIs). Our method also uses a massive new data source for learning view extrapolation: online videos on YouTube. Using data mined from such videos, we train a deep network that predicts an MPI from an input stereo image pair. This inferred MPI can then be used to synthesize a range of novel views of the scene, including views that extrapolate significantly beyond the input baseline. We show that our method compares favorably with several recent view synthesis methods, and demonstrate applications in magnifying narrow-baseline stereo images. 
### 499.Greedy Graph Searching for Vascular Tracking in Angiographic Image  Sequences [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09940.pdf)
> Vascular tracking of angiographic image sequences is one of the most clinically important tasks in the diagnostic assessment and interventional guidance of cardiac disease. However, this task can be challenging to accomplish because of unsatisfactory angiography image quality and complex vascular structures. Thus, this study proposed a new greedy graph search-based method for vascular tracking. Each vascular branch is separated from the vasculature and is tracked independently. Then, all branches are combined using topology optimization, thereby resulting in complete vasculature tracking. A gray-based image registration method was applied to determine the tracking range, and the deformation field between two consecutive frames was calculated. The vascular branch was described using a vascular centerline extraction method with multi-probability fusion-based topology optimization. We introduce an undirected acyclic graph establishment technique. A greedy search method was proposed to acquire all possible paths in the graph that might match the tracked vascular branch. The final tracking result was selected by branch matching using dynamic time warping with a DAISY descriptor. The solution to the problem reflected both the spatial and textural information between successive frames. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method was effective and robust for vascular tracking, attaining a F1 score of 0.89 on a single branch dataset and 0.88 on a vessel tree dataset. This approach provided a universal solution to address the problem of filamentary structure tracking. 
### 500.Meta Transfer Learning for Facial Emotion Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09946.pdf)
> The use of deep learning techniques for automatic facial expression recognition has recently attracted great interest but developed models are still unable to generalize well due to the lack of large emotion datasets for deep learning. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose utilizing a novel transfer learning approach relying on PathNet and investigate how knowledge can be accumulated within a given dataset and how the knowledge captured from one emotion dataset can be transferred into another in order to improve the overall performance. To evaluate the robustness of our system, we have conducted various sets of experiments on two emotion datasets: SAVEE and eNTERFACE. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system leads to improvement in performance of emotion recognition and performs significantly better than the recent state-of-the-art schemes adopting fine-\ tuning/pre-trained approaches. 
### 501.Deep Functional Dictionaries: Learning Consistent Semantic Structures on  3D Models from Functions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09957.pdf)
> Various 3D semantic attributes such as segmentation masks, geometric features, keypoints, and materials can be encoded as per-point probe functions on 3D geometries. Given a collection of related 3D shapes, we consider how to jointly analyze such probe functions over different shapes, and how to discover common latent structures using a neural network --- even in the absence of any correspondence information. Our network is trained on point cloud representations of shape geometry and associated semantic functions on that point cloud. These functions express a shared semantic understanding of the shapes but are not coordinated in any way. For example, in a segmentation task, the functions can be indicator functions of arbitrary sets of shape parts, with the particular combination involved not known to the network. Our network is able to produce a small dictionary of basis functions for each shape, a dictionary whose span includes the semantic functions provided for that shape. Even though our shapes have independent discretizations and no functional correspondences are provided, the network is able to generate latent bases, in a consistent order, that reflect the shared semantic structure among the shapes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in various segmentation and keypoint selection applications. 
### 502.Cooking State Recognition From Images Using Inception Architecture [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09967.pdf)
> A kitchen robot properly needs to understand the cooking environment to continue any cooking activities. But object's state detection has not been researched well so far as like object detection. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to identify different cooking states from images for a kitchen robot. In our research, we investigate particularly the performance of Inception architecture and propose a modified architecture based on Inception model to classify different cooking states. The model is analyzed robustly in terms of different layers, and optimizers. Experimental results on a cooking datasets demonstrate that proposed model can be a potential solution to the cooking state recognition problem. 
### 503.Part-based Visual Tracking via Structural Support Correlation Filter [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09971.pdf)
> Recently, part-based and support vector machines (SVM) based trackers have shown favorable performance. Nonetheless, the time-consuming online training and updating process limit their real-time applications. In order to better deal with the partial occlusion issue and improve their efficiency, we propose a novel part-based structural support correlation filter tracking method, which absorbs the strong discriminative ability from SVM and the excellent property of part-based tracking methods which is less sensitive to partial occlusion. Then, our proposed model can learn the support correlation filter of each part jointly by a star structure model, which preserves the spatial layout structure among parts and tolerates outliers of parts. In addition, to mitigate the issue of drift away from object further, we introduce inter-frame consistencies of local parts into our model. Finally, in our model, we accurately estimate the scale changes of object by the relative distance change among reliable parts. The extensive empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets: OTB2015, TempleColor128 and VOT2015 demonstrate that the proposed method performs superiorly against several state-of-the-art trackers in terms of tracking accuracy, speed and robustness. 
### 504.Beyond Textures: Learning from Multi-domain Artistic Images for  Arbitrary Style Transfer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09987.pdf)
> We propose a fast feed-forward network for arbitrary style transfer, which can generate stylized image for previously unseen content and style image pairs. Besides the traditional content and style representation based on deep features and statistics for textures, we use adversarial networks to regularize the generation of stylized images. Our adversarial network learns the intrinsic property of image styles from large-scale multi-domain artistic images. The adversarial training is challenging because both the input and output of our generator are diverse multi-domain images. We use a conditional generator that stylized content by shifting the statistics of deep features, and a conditional discriminator based on the coarse category of styles. Moreover, we propose a mask module to spatially decide the stylization level and stabilize adversarial training by avoiding mode collapse. As a side effect, our trained discriminator can be applied to rank and select representative stylized images. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the proposed method, and compare with recent style transfer methods. 
### 505.Key Person Aided Re-identification in Partially Ordered Pedestrian Set [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10017.pdf)
> Ideally person re-identification seeks for perfect feature representation and metric model that re-identify all various pedestrians well in non-overlapping views at different locations with different camera configurations, which is very challenging. However, in most pedestrian sets, there always are some outstanding persons who are relatively easy to re-identify. Inspired by the existence of such data division, we propose a novel key person aided person re-identification framework based on the re-defined partially ordered pedestrian sets. The outstanding persons, namely "key persons", are selected by the K-nearest neighbor based saliency measurement. The partial order defined by pedestrian entering time in surveillance associates the key persons with the query person temporally and helps to locate the possible candidates. Experiments conducted on two video datasets show that the proposed key person aided framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and improves the matching accuracy greatly at all ranks. 
### 506.DIF : Dataset of Intoxicated Faces for Drunk Person Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10030.pdf)
> Traffic accidents cause over a million deaths every year, of which a large fraction is attributed to drunk driving. Automated drunk detection systems in vehicles are necessary to reduce traffic accidents and the related financial costs. Existing solutions require special equipment such as electrocardiogram, infrared cameras or breathalyzers. In this work, we propose a new dataset called DIF (Dataset of Intoxicated Faces) containing RGB face videos of drunk and sober people obtained from online sources. We analyze the face videos to extract features related to eye gaze, face pose and facial expressions. A recurrent neural network is used to model the evolution of these multimodal facial features. Our experiments show the eye gaze and facial expression features to be particularly discriminative for our dataset. We achieve good classification accuracy on the DIF dataset and show that face videos can be effectively used to detect drunk people. Such face videos can be readily acquired through a camera and used to prevent drunk driving incidents. 
### 507.Unsupervisedly Training GANs for Segmenting Digital Pathology with  Automatically Generated Annotations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10059.pdf)
> Recently, generative adversarial networks exhibited excellent performances in semi-supervised image analysis scenarios. In this paper, we go even further by proposing a fully unsupervised approach for segmentation applications with prior knowledge of the objects' shapes. We propose and investigate different strategies to generate simulated label data and perform image-to-image translation between the image and the label domain using an adversarial model. Specifically, we assess the impact of the annotation model's accuracy as well as the effect of simulating additional low-level image features. For experimental evaluation, we consider the segmentation of the glomeruli, an application scenario from renal pathology. Experiments provide proof of concept and also confirm that the strategy for creating the simulated label data is of particular relevance considering the stability of GAN trainings. 
### 508.A Double-Deep Spatio-Angular Learning Framework for Light Field based  Face Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10078.pdf)
> Face recognition has attracted increasing attention due to its wide range of applications but it is still challenging when facing large variations in the biometric data characteristics. Lenslet light field cameras have recently come into prominence to capture rich spatio-angular information, thus offering new possibilities for designing advanced biometric recognition systems. This paper proposes a double-deep spatio-angular learning framework for light field based face recognition, which is able to learn convolutional representations and angular dynamics from a light field image; this is a novel recognition framework that has never been proposed before for either face recognition or any other visual recognition task. The proposed double-deep learning framework includes a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent network whose inputs are VGG-Face descriptions, computed using a VGG-Very-Deep-16 convolutional neural network (CNN) for different face viewpoints rendered from the full light field image, which are organised as a pseudo-video sequence. A comprehensive set of experiments has been conducted with the IST-EURECOM light field face database, for varied and challenging recognition tasks. Results show that the proposed framework achieves superior face recognition performance when compared to the state-of-the-art. 
### 509.Underwater Fish Species Classification using Convolutional Neural  Network and Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10106.pdf)
> The target of this paper is to recommend a way for Automated classification of Fish species. A high accuracy fish classification is required for greater understanding of fish behavior in Ichthyology and by marine biologists. Maintaining a ledger of the number of fishes per species and marking the endangered species in large and small water bodies is required by concerned institutions. Majority of available methods focus on classification of fishes outside of water because underwater classification poses challenges such as background noises, distortion of images, the presence of other water bodies in images, image quality and occlusion. This method uses a novel technique based on Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Image Processing to achieve an accuracy of 96.29%. This method ensures considerably discrimination accuracy improvements than the previously proposed methods. 
### 510.Generating protected fingerprint template utilizing coprime mapping  transformation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10108.pdf)
> The identity of a user is permanently lost if biometric data gets compromised since the biometric information is irreplaceable and irrevocable. To revoke and reissue a new template in place of the compromised biometric template, the idea of cancelable biometrics has been introduced. The concept behind cancelable biometric is to irreversibly transform the original biometric template and perform the comparison in the protected domain. In this paper, a coprime transformation scheme has been proposed to derive a protected fingerprint template. The method divides the fingerprint region into a number of sectors with respect to each minutiae point and identifies the nearest-neighbor minutiae in each sector. Then, ridge features for all neighboring minutiae points are computed and mapped onto co-prime positions of a random matrix to generate the cancelable template. The proposed approach achieves an EER of 1.82, 1.39, 4.02 and 5.77 on DB1, DB2, DB3 and DB4 datasets of the FVC2002 and an EER of 8.70, 7.95, 5.23 and 4.87 on DB1, DB2, DB3 and DB4 datasets of FVC2004 databases, respectively. Experimental evaluations indicate that the method outperforms in comparison to the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, it has been confirmed from the security analysis that the proposed method fulfills the desired characteristics of diversity, revocability, and non-invertibility with a minor performance degradation caused by the transformation. 
### 511.Deep Residual Networks with a Fully Connected Recon-struction Layer for  Single Image Super-Resolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10143.pdf)
> Recently, deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and efficiency for single image super-resolution (SISR). However, the network model of these methods is a fully convolutional neural network, which is limit to exploit contextual information over the global region of the input image. In this paper, we discuss a new SR architecture where features are extracted in the low-resolution (LR) space, and then we use a fully connected layer which learns an array of upsampling weights to reconstruct the desired high-resolution (HR) image from the final LR features. By doing so, we effectively exploit global context information over the input image region, whilst maintaining the low computational complexity for the overall SR operation. In addition, we introduce an edge difference constraint into our loss function to pre-serve edges and texture structures. Extensive experiments validate that our meth-od outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods 
### 512.f-CNN$^{\text{x}}$: A Toolflow for Mapping Multiple Convolutional Neural  Networks on FPGAs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10174.pdf)
> The predictive power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been an integral factor for emerging latency-sensitive applications, such as autonomous drones and vehicles. Such systems employ multiple CNNs, each one trained for a particular task. The efficient mapping of multiple CNNs on a single FPGA device is a challenging task as the allocation of compute resources and external memory bandwidth needs to be optimised at design time. This paper proposes f-CNN$^{\text{x}}$, an automated toolflow for the optimised mapping of multiple CNNs on FPGAs, comprising a novel multi-CNN hardware architecture together with an automated design space exploration method that considers the user-specified performance requirements for each model to allocate compute resources and generate a synthesisable accelerator. Moreover, f-CNN$^{\text{x}}$ employs a novel scheduling algorithm that alleviates the limitations of the memory bandwidth contention between CNNs and sustains the high utilisation of the architecture. Experimental evaluation shows that f-CNN$^{\text{x}}$'s designs outperform contention-unaware FPGA mappings by up to 50% and deliver up to 6.8x higher performance-per-Watt over highly optimised GPU designs for multi-CNN systems. 
### 513.Pyramid Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10180.pdf)
> A Pyramid Attention Network(PAN) is proposed to exploit the impact of global contextual information in semantic segmentation. Different from most existing works, we combine attention mechanism and spatial pyramid to extract precise dense features for pixel labeling instead of complicated dilated convolution and artificially designed decoder networks. Specifically, we introduce a Feature Pyramid Attention module to perform spatial pyramid attention structure on high-level output and combining global pooling to learn a better feature representation, and a Global Attention Upsample module on each decoder layer to provide global context as a guidance of low-level features to select category localization details. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes benchmarks with a new record of mIoU accuracy 84.0% on PASCAL VOC 2012, while training without COCO dataset. 
### 514.Qunatification of Metabolites in MR Spectroscopic Imaging using Machine  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10201.pdf)
> Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) is a clinical imaging modality for measuring tissue metabolite levels in-vivo. An accurate estimation of spectral parameters allows for better assessment of spectral quality and metabolite concentration levels. The current gold standard quantification method is the LCModel - a commercial fitting tool. However, this fails for spectra having poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or a large number of artifacts. This paper introduces a framework based on random forest regression for accurate estimation of the output parameters of a model based analysis of MR spectroscopy data. The goal of our proposed framework is to learn the spectral features from a training set comprising of different variations of both simulated and in-vivo brain spectra and then use this learning for the subsequent metabolite quantification. Experiments involve training and testing on simulated and in-vivo human brain spectra. We estimate parameters such as concentration of metabolites and compare our results with that from the LCModel. 
### 515.Conditional Generative Adversarial and Convolutional Networks for X-ray  Breast Mass Segmentation and Shape Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10207.pdf)
> This paper proposes a novel approach based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) for breast mass segmentation in mammography. We hypothesized that the cGAN structure is well-suited to accurately outline the mass area, especially when the training data is limited. The generative network learns intrinsic features of tumors while the adversarial network enforces segmentations to be similar to the ground truth. Experiments performed on dozens of malignant tumors extracted from the public DDSM dataset and from our in-house private dataset confirm our hypothesis with very high Dice coefficient and Jaccard index (&gt;94% and &gt;89%, respectively) outperforming the scores obtained by other state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, in order to detect portray significant morphological features of the segmented tumor, a specific Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have also been designed for classifying the segmented tumor areas into four types (irregular, lobular, oval and round), which provides an overall accuracy about 72% with the DDSM dataset. 
### 516.Psychophysics, Gestalts and Games [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10210.pdf)
> Many psychophysical studies are dedicated to the evaluation of the human gestalt detection on dot or Gabor patterns, and to model its dependence on the pattern and background parameters. Nevertheless, even for these constrained percepts, psychophysics have not yet reached the challenging prediction stage, where human detection would be quantitatively predicted by a (generic) model. On the other hand, Computer Vision has attempted at defining automatic detection thresholds. This chapter sketches a procedure to confront these two methodologies inspired in gestaltism. Using a computational quantitative version of the non-accidentalness principle, we raise the possibility that the psychophysical and the (older) gestaltist setups, both applicable on dot or Gabor patterns, find a useful complement in a Turing test. In our perceptual Turing test, human performance is compared by the scientist to the detection result given by a computer. This confrontation permits to revive the abandoned method of gestaltic games. We sketch the elaboration of such a game, where the subjects of the experiment are confronted to an alignment detection algorithm, and are invited to draw examples that will fool it. We show that in that way a more precise definition of the alignment gestalt and of its computational formulation seems to emerge. Detection algorithms might also be relevant to more classic psychophysical setups, where they can again play the role of a Turing test. To a visual experiment where subjects were invited to detect alignments in Gabor patterns, we associated a single function measuring the alignment detectability in the form of a number of false alarms (NFA). The first results indicate that the values of the NFA, as a function of all simulation parameters, are highly correlated to the human detection. This fact, that we intend to support by further experiments , might end up confirming that human alignment detection is the result of a single mechanism. 
### 517.SLSDeep: Skin Lesion Segmentation Based on Dilated Residual and Pyramid  Pooling Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10241.pdf)
> Skin lesion segmentation (SLS) in dermoscopic images is a crucial task for automated diagnosis of melanoma. In this paper, we present a robust deep learning SLS model, so-called SLSDeep, which is represented as an encoder-decoder network. The encoder network is constructed by dilated residual layers, in turn, a pyramid pooling network followed by three convolution layers is used for the decoder. Unlike the traditional methods employing a cross-entropy loss, we investigated a loss function by combining both Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) and End Point Error (EPE) to accurately segment the melanoma regions with sharp boundaries. The robustness of the proposed model was evaluated on two public databases: ISBI 2016 and 2017 for skin lesion analysis towards melanoma detection challenge. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy. Moreover, it is capable to segment more than $100$ images of size 384x384 per second on a recent GPU. 
### 518.Intrinsic Image Transformation via Scale Space Decomposition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10253.pdf)
> We introduce a new network structure for decomposing an image into its intrinsic albedo and shading. We treat this as an image-to-image transformation problem and explore the scale space of the input and output. By expanding the output images (albedo and shading) into their Laplacian pyramid components, we develop a multi-channel network structure that learns the image-to-image transformation function in successive frequency bands in parallel, within each channel is a fully convolutional neural network with skip connections. This network structure is general and extensible, and has demonstrated excellent performance on the intrinsic image decomposition problem. We evaluate the network on two benchmark datasets: the MPI-Sintel dataset and the MIT Intrinsic Images dataset. Both quantitative and qualitative results show our model delivers a clear progression over state-of-the-art. 
### 519.Parallel Architecture and Hyperparameter Search via Successive Halving  and Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10255.pdf)
> We present a simple and powerful algorithm for parallel black box optimization called Successive Halving and Classification (SHAC). The algorithm operates in $K$ stages of parallel function evaluations and trains a cascade of binary classifiers to iteratively cull the undesirable regions of the search space. SHAC is easy to implement, requires no tuning of its own configuration parameters, is invariant to the scale of the objective function and can be built using any choice of binary classifier. We adopt tree-based classifiers within SHAC and achieve competitive performance against several strong baselines for optimizing synthetic functions, hyperparameters and architectures. 
### 520.Unsupervised Learning for Large-Scale Fiber Detection and Tracking in  Microscopic Material Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10256.pdf)
> Constructing 3D structures from serial section data is a long standing problem in microscopy. The structure of a fiber reinforced composite material can be reconstructed using a tracking-by-detection model. Tracking-by-detection algorithms rely heavily on detection accuracy, especially the recall performance. The state-of-the-art fiber detection algorithms perform well under ideal conditions, but are not accurate where there are local degradations of image quality, due to contaminants on the material surface and/or defocus blur. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) could be used for this problem, but would require a large number of manual annotated fibers, which are not available. We propose an unsupervised learning method to accurately detect fibers on the large scale, that is robust against local degradations of image quality. The proposed method does not require manual annotations, but uses fiber shape/size priors and spatio-temporal consistency in tracking to simulate the supervision in the training of the CNN. Experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art fiber detection algorithms together with advanced tracking performance. 
### 521.Towards a glaucoma risk index based on simulated hemodynamics from  fundus images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10273.pdf)
> Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible but preventable blindness in the world. Its major treatable risk factor is the intra-ocular pressure, although other biomarkers are being explored to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. It has been recently observed that glaucoma induces changes in the ocular hemodynamics. However, its effects on the functional behavior of the retinal arterioles have not been studied yet. In this paper we propose a first approach for characterizing those changes using computational hemodynamics. The retinal blood flow is simulated using a 0D model for a steady, incompressible non Newtonian fluid in rigid domains. The simulation is performed on patient-specific arterial trees extracted from fundus images. We also propose a novel feature representation technique to comprise the outcomes of the simulation stage into a fixed length feature vector that can be used for classification studies. Our experiments on a new database of fundus images show that our approach is able to capture representative changes in the hemodynamics of glaucomatous patients. Code and data are publicly available in <a href="https://ignaciorlando.github.io.">this https URL</a> 
### 522.Pathology Segmentation using Distributional Differences to Images of  Healthy Origin [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10344.pdf)
> We present a method to model pathologies in medical data, trained on data labelled on the image level as healthy or containing a visual defect. Our model not only allows us to create pixelwise semantic segmentations, it is also able to create inpaintings for the segmentations to render the pathological image healthy. Furthermore, we can draw new unseen pathology samples from this model based on the distribution in the data. We show quantitatively, that our method is able to segment pathologies with a surprising accuracy and show qualitative results of both the segmentations and inpaintings. A comparison with a supervised segmentation method indicates, that the accuracy of our proposed weakly-supervised segmentation is nevertheless quite close. 
### 523.What Face and Body Shapes Can Tell About Height [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10355.pdf)
> Recovering a person's height from a single image is important for virtual garment fitting, autonomous driving and surveillance, however, it is also very challenging due to the absence of absolute scale information. We tackle the rarely addressed case, where camera parameters and scene geometry is unknown. To nevertheless resolve the inherent scale ambiguity, we infer height from statistics that are intrinsic to human anatomy and can be estimated from images directly, such as articulated pose, bone length proportions, and facial features. Our contribution is twofold. First, we experiment with different machine learning models to capture the relation between image content and human height. Second, we show that performance is predominantly limited by dataset size and create a new dataset that is three magnitudes larger, by mining explicit height labels and propagating them to additional images through face recognition and assignment consistency. Our evaluation shows that monocular height estimation is possible with a MAE of 5.56cm. 
### 524.Heterogeneous Bitwidth Binarization in Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10368.pdf)
> Recent work has shown that fast, compact low-bitwidth neural networks can be surprisingly accurate. These networks use homogeneous binarization: all parameters in each layer or (more commonly) the whole model have the same low bitwidth (e.g., 2 bits). However, modern hardware allows efficient designs where each arithmetic instruction can have a custom bitwidth, motivating heterogeneous binarization, where every parameter in the network may have a different bitwidth. In this paper, we show that it is feasible and useful to select bitwidths at the parameter granularity during training. For instance a heterogeneously quantized version of modern networks such as AlexNet and MobileNet, with the right mix of 1-, 2- and 3-bit parameters that average to just 1.4 bits can equal the accuracy of homogeneous 2-bit versions of these networks. Further, we provide analyses to show that the heterogeneously binarized systems yield FPGA- and ASIC-based implementations that are correspondingly more efficient in both circuit area and energy efficiency than their homogeneous counterparts. 
### 525.Less is More: Simultaneous View Classification and Landmark Detection  for Abdominal Ultrasound Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10376.pdf)
> An abdominal ultrasound examination, which is the most common ultrasound examination, requires substantial manual efforts to acquire standard abdominal organ views, annotate the views in texts, and record clinically relevant organ measurements. Hence, automatic view classification and landmark detection of the organs can be instrumental to streamline the examination workflow. However, this is a challenging problem given not only the inherent difficulties from the ultrasound modality, e.g., low contrast and large variations, but also the heterogeneity across tasks, i.e., one classification task for all views, and then one landmark detection task for each relevant view. While convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated more promising outcomes on ultrasound image analytics than traditional machine learning approaches, it becomes impractical to deploy multiple networks (one for each task) due to the limited computational and memory resources on most existing ultrasound scanners. To overcome such limits, we propose a multi-task learning framework to handle all the tasks by a single network. This network is integrated to perform view classification and landmark detection simultaneously; it is also equipped with global convolutional kernels, coordinate constraints, and a conditional adversarial module to leverage the performances. In an experimental study based on 187,219 ultrasound images, with the proposed simplified approach we achieve (1) view classification accuracy better than the agreement between two clinical experts and (2) landmark-based measurement errors on par with inter-user variability. The multi-task approach also benefits from sharing the feature extraction during the training process across all tasks and, as a result, outperforms the approaches that address each task individually. 
### 526.Human Action Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10416.pdf)
> Inspired by the recent advances in generative models, we introduce a human action generation model in order to generate a consecutive sequence of human motions to formulate novel actions. We propose a framework of an autoencoder and a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce multiple and consecutive human actions conditioned on the initial state and the given class label. The proposed model is trained in an end-to-end fashion, where the autoencoder is jointly trained with the GAN. The model is trained on the NTU RGB+D dataset and we show that the proposed model can generate different styles of actions. Moreover, the model can successfully generate a sequence of novel actions given different action labels as conditions. The conventional human action prediction and generation models lack those features, which are essential for practical applications. 
### 527.Enhanced-alignment Measure for Binary Foreground Map Evaluation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10421.pdf)
> The existing binary foreground map (FM) measures to address various types of errors in either pixel-wise or structural ways. These measures consider pixel-level match or image-level information independently, while cognitive vision studies have shown that human vision is highly sensitive to both global information and local details in scenes. In this paper, we take a detailed look at current binary FM evaluation measures and propose a novel and effective E-measure (Enhanced-alignment measure). Our measure combines local pixel values with the image-level mean value in one term, jointly capturing image-level statistics and local pixel matching information. We demonstrate the superiority of our measure over the available measures on 4 popular datasets via 5 meta-measures, including ranking models for applications, demoting generic, random Gaussian noise maps, ground-truth switch, as well as human judgments. We find large improvements in almost all the meta-measures. For instance, in terms of application ranking, we observe improvementrangingfrom9.08% to 19.65% compared with other popular measures. 
### 528.A novel hybrid score level and decision level fusion scheme for  cancelable multi-biometric verification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10433.pdf)
> In spite of the benefits of biometric-based authentication systems, there are few concerns raised because of the sensitivity of biometric data to outliers, low performance caused due to intra-class variations and privacy invasion caused by information leakage. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid fusion framework where only the protected modalities are combined to fulfill the requirement of secrecy and performance improvement. This paper presents a method to integrate cancelable modalities utilizing mean-closure weighting (MCW) score level and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory based decision level fusion for iris and fingerprint to mitigate the limitations in the individual score or decision fusion mechanisms. The proposed hybrid fusion scheme incorporates the similarity scores from different matchers corresponding to each protected modality. The individual scores obtained from different matchers for each modality are combined using MCW score fusion method. The MCW technique achieves the optimal weight for each matcher involved in the score computation. Further, DS theory is applied to the induced scores to output the final decision. The rigorous experimental evaluations on three virtual databases indicate that the proposed hybrid fusion framework outperforms over the component level or individual fusion methods (score level and decision level fusion). As a result, we achieve (48%,66%), (72%,86%) and (49%,38%) of performance improvement over unimodal cancelable iris and unimodal cancelable fingerprint verification systems for Virtual_A, Virtual_B and Virtual_C databases, respectively. Also, the proposed method is robust enough to the variability of scores and outliers satisfying the requirement of secure authentication. 
### 529.Fine-Grained Age Estimation in the wild with Attention LSTM Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10445.pdf)
> Age estimation from a single face image has been an essential task in the field of human-computer interaction and computer vision which has a wide range of practical application value. Concerning the problem that accuracy of age estimation of face images in the wild are relatively low for existing methods, where they take into account only the whole features of face image while neglecting the fine-grained features of age-sensitive area, we propose a method based on Attention LSTM network for Fine-Grained age estimation in the wild based on the idea of Fine-Grained categories and visual attention mechanism. This method combines ResNets or RoR models with LSTM unit to construct AL-ResNets or AL-RoR networks to extract age-sensitive local regions, which effectively improves age estimation accuracy. Firstly, ResNets or RoR model pre-trained on ImageNet dataset is selected as the basic model, which is then fine-tuned on the IMDB-WIKI-101 dataset for age estimation. Then, we fine-tune ResNets or RoR on the target age datasets to extract the global features of face images. To extract the local characteristics of age-sensitive areas, the LSTM unit is then presented to obtain the coordinates of the age-sensitive region automatically. Finally, the age group classification experiment is conducted directly on the Adience dataset, and age-regression experiments are performed by the Deep EXpectation algorithm (DEX) on MORPH Album 2, FG-NET and LAP datasets. By combining the global and local features, we got our final prediction results. Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of AL-ResNets or AL-RoR for age estimation in the wild, where it achieves new state-of-the-art performance than all other CNN methods on the Adience, MORPH Album 2, FG-NET and LAP datasets. 
### 530.L1-(2D)2PCANet: A Deep Learning Network for Face Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10476.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning network L1-(2D)2PCANet for face recognition, which is based on L1-norm-based two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis (L1-(2D)2PCA). In our network, the role of L1-(2D)2PCA is to learn the filters of multiple convolution layers. After the convolution layers, we deploy binary hashing and block-wise histogram for pooling. We test our network on some benchmark facial datasets YALE, AR, Extended Yale B, LFW-a and FERET with CNN, PCANet, 2DPCANet and L1-PCANet as comparison. The results show that the recognition performance of L1-(2D)2PCANet in all tests is better than baseline networks, especially when there are outliers in the test data. Owing to the L1-norm, L1-2D2PCANet is robust to outliers and changes of the training images. 
### 531.Look at Boundary: A Boundary-Aware Face Alignment Algorithm [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10483.pdf)
> We present a novel boundary-aware face alignment algorithm by utilising boundary lines as the geometric structure of a human face to help facial landmark localisation. Unlike the conventional heatmap based method and regression based method, our approach derives face landmarks from boundary lines which remove the ambiguities in the landmark definition. Three questions are explored and answered by this work: 1. Why using boundary? 2. How to use boundary? 3. What is the relationship between boundary estimation and landmarks localisation? Our boundary- aware face alignment algorithm achieves 3.49% mean error on 300-W Fullset, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our method can also easily integrate information from other datasets. By utilising boundary information of 300-W dataset, our method achieves 3.92% mean error with 0.39% failure rate on COFW dataset, and 1.25% mean error on AFLW-Full dataset. Moreover, we propose a new dataset WFLW to unify training and testing across different factors, including poses, expressions, illuminations, makeups, occlusions, and blurriness. Dataset and model will be publicly available at <a href="https://wywu.github.io/projects/LAB/LAB.html">this https URL</a> 
### 532.Vehicle Instance Segmentation from Aerial Image and Video Using a  Multi-Task Learning Residual Fully Convolutional Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10485.pdf)
> Object detection and semantic segmentation are two main themes in object retrieval from high-resolution remote sensing images, which have recently achieved remarkable performance by surfing the wave of deep learning and, more notably, convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we are interested in a novel, more challenging problem of vehicle instance segmentation, which entails identifying, at a pixel-level, where the vehicles appear as well as associating each pixel with a physical instance of a vehicle. In contrast, vehicle detection and semantic segmentation each only concern one of the two. We propose to tackle this problem with a semantic boundary-aware multi-task learning network. More specifically, we utilize the philosophy of residual learning (ResNet) to construct a fully convolutional network that is capable of harnessing multi-level contextual feature representations learned from different residual blocks. We theoretically analyze and discuss why residual networks can produce better probability maps for pixel-wise segmentation tasks. Then, based on this network architecture, we propose a unified multi-task learning network that can simultaneously learn two complementary tasks, namely, segmenting vehicle regions and detecting semantic boundaries. The latter subproblem is helpful for differentiating closely spaced vehicles, which are usually not correctly separated into instances. Currently, datasets with pixel-wise annotation for vehicle extraction are ISPRS dataset and IEEE GRSS DFC2015 dataset over Zeebrugge, which specializes in semantic segmentation. Therefore, we built a new, more challenging dataset for vehicle instance segmentation, called the Busy Parking Lot UAV Video dataset, and we make our dataset available at <a href="http://www.sipeo.bgu.tum.de/download">this http URL</a> so that it can be used to benchmark future vehicle instance segmentation algorithms. 
### 533.Video Summarization Using Fully Convolutional Sequence Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10538.pdf)
> This paper addresses the problem of video summarization. Given an input video, the goal is to select a subset of the frames to create a summary video that optimally captures the important information of the input video. With the large amount of videos available online, video summarization provides a useful tool that assists video search, retrieval, browsing, etc. In this paper, we formulate video summarization as a sequence labeling problem. Unlike existing approaches that use recurrent models, we propose fully convolutional sequence models to solve video summarization. We firstly establish a novel connection between semantic segmentation and video summarization, and then adapt popular semantic segmentation networks for video summarization. Extensive experiments and analysis on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our models. 
### 534.Transductive Label Augmentation for Improved Deep Network Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10546.pdf)
> A major impediment to the application of deep learning to real-world problems is the scarcity of labeled data. Small training sets are in fact of no use to deep networks as, due to the large number of trainable parameters, they will very likely be subject to overfitting phenomena. On the other hand, the increment of the training set size through further manual or semi-automatic labellings can be costly, if not possible at times. Thus, the standard techniques to address this issue are transfer learning and data augmentation, which consists of applying some sort of "transformation" to existing labeled instances to let the training set grow in size. Although this approach works well in applications such as image classification, where it is relatively simple to design suitable transformation operators, it is not obvious how to apply it in more structured scenarios. Motivated by the observation that in virtually all application domains it is easy to obtain unlabeled data, in this paper we take a different perspective and propose a \emph{label augmentation} approach. We start from a small, curated labeled dataset and let the labels propagate through a larger set of unlabeled data using graph transduction techniques. This allows us to naturally use (second-order) similarity information which resides in the data, a source of information which is typically neglected by standard augmentation techniques. In particular, we show that by using known game theoretic transductive processes we can create larger and accurate enough labeled datasets which use results in better trained neural networks. Preliminary experiments are reported which demonstrate a consistent improvement over standard image classification datasets. 
### 535.Using Syntax to Ground Referring Expressions in Natural Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10547.pdf)
> We introduce GroundNet, a neural network for referring expression recognition -- the task of localizing (or grounding) in an image the object referred to by a natural language expression. Our approach to this task is the first to rely on a syntactic analysis of the input referring expression in order to inform the structure of the computation graph. Given a parse tree for an input expression, we explicitly map the syntactic constituents and relationships present in the tree to a composed graph of neural modules that defines our architecture for performing localization. This syntax-based approach aids localization of \textit{both} the target object and auxiliary supporting objects mentioned in the expression. As a result, GroundNet is more interpretable than previous methods: we can (1) determine which phrase of the referring expression points to which object in the image and (2) track how the localization of the target object is determined by the network. We study this property empirically by introducing a new set of annotations on the GoogleRef dataset to evaluate localization of supporting objects. Our experiments show that GroundNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in identifying supporting objects, while maintaining comparable performance in the localization of target objects. 
### 536.Deep Watershed Detector for Music Object Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10548.pdf)
> Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is an important and challenging area within music information retrieval, the accurate detection of music symbols in digital images is a core functionality of any OMR pipeline. In this paper, we introduce a novel object detection method, based on synthetic energy maps and the watershed transform, called Deep Watershed Detector (DWD). Our method is specifically tailored to deal with high resolution images that contain a large number of very small objects and is therefore able to process full pages of written music. We present state-of-the-art detection results of common music symbols and show DWD's ability to work with synthetic scores equally well as on handwritten music. 
### 537.Hierarchical Representation Learning for Kinship Verification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10557.pdf)
> Kinship verification has a number of applications such as organizing large collections of images and recognizing resemblances among humans. In this research, first, a human study is conducted to understand the capabilities of human mind and to identify the discriminatory areas of a face that facilitate kinship-cues. Utilizing the information obtained from the human study, a hierarchical Kinship Verification via Representation Learning (KVRL) framework is utilized to learn the representation of different face regions in an unsupervised manner. We propose a novel approach for feature representation termed as filtered contractive deep belief networks (fcDBN). The proposed feature representation encodes relational information present in images using filters and contractive regularization penalty. A compact representation of facial images of kin is extracted as an output from the learned model and a multi-layer neural network is utilized to verify the kin accurately. A new WVU Kinship Database is created which consists of multiple images per subject to facilitate kinship verification. The results show that the proposed deep learning framework (KVRL-fcDBN) yields stateof-the-art kinship verification accuracy on the WVU Kinship database and on four existing benchmark datasets. Further, kinship information is used as a soft biometric modality to boost the performance of face verification via product of likelihood ratio and support vector machine based approaches. Using the proposed KVRL-fcDBN framework, an improvement of over 20% is observed in the performance of face verification. 
### 538.DPW-SDNet: Dual Pixel-Wavelet Domain Deep CNNs for Soft Decoding of  JPEG-Compressed Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10558.pdf)
> JPEG is one of the widely used lossy compression methods. JPEG-compressed images usually suffer from compression artifacts including blocking and blurring, especially at low bit-rates. Soft decoding is an effective solution to improve the quality of compressed images without changing codec or introducing extra coding bits. Inspired by the excellent performance of the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on both low-level and high-level computer vision problems, we develop a dual pixel-wavelet domain deep CNNs-based soft decoding network for JPEG-compressed images, namely DPW-SDNet. The pixel domain deep network takes the four downsampled versions of the compressed image to form a 4-channel input and outputs a pixel domain prediction, while the wavelet domain deep network uses the 1-level discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) coefficients to form a 4-channel input to produce a DWT domain prediction. The pixel domain and wavelet domain estimates are combined to generate the final soft decoded result. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DPW-SDNet over several state-of-the-art compression artifacts reduction algorithms. 
### 539.Dual Swap Disentangling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10583.pdf)
> Learning interpretable disentangled representations is a crucial yet challenging task. In this paper, we propose a weakly semi-supervised method, termed as Dual Swap Disentangling (DSD), for disentangling using both labeled and unlabeled data. Unlike conventional weakly supervised methods that rely on full annotations on the group of samples, we require only limited annotations on paired samples that indicate their shared attribute like the color. Our model takes the form of a dual autoencoder structure. To achieve disentangling using the labeled pairs, we follow a "encoding-swap-decoding" process, where we first swap the parts of their encodings corresponding to the shared attribute and then decode the obtained hybrid codes to reconstruct the original input pairs. For unlabeled pairs, we follow the "encoding-swap-decoding" process twice on designated encoding parts and enforce the final outputs to approximate the input pairs. By isolating parts of the encoding and swapping them back and forth, we impose the dimension-wise modularity and portability of the encodings of the unlabeled samples, which implicitly encourages disentangling under the guidance of labeled pairs. This dual swap mechanism, tailored for semi-supervised setting, turns out to be very effective. Experiments on image datasets from a wide domain show that our model yields state-of-the-art disentangling performances. 
### 540.Generative Adversarial Image Synthesis with Decision Tree Latent  Controller [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10603.pdf)
> This paper proposes the decision tree latent controller generative adversarial network (DTLC-GAN), an extension of a GAN that can learn hierarchically interpretable representations without relying on detailed supervision. To impose a hierarchical inclusion structure on latent variables, we incorporate a new architecture called the DTLC into the generator input. The DTLC has a multiple-layer tree structure in which the ON or OFF of the child node codes is controlled by the parent node codes. By using this architecture hierarchically, we can obtain the latent space in which the lower layer codes are selectively used depending on the higher layer ones. To make the latent codes capture salient semantic features of images in a hierarchically disentangled manner in the DTLC, we also propose a hierarchical conditional mutual information regularization and optimize it with a newly defined curriculum learning method that we propose as well. This makes it possible to discover hierarchically interpretable representations in a layer-by-layer manner on the basis of information gain by only using a single DTLC-GAN model. We evaluated the DTLC-GAN on various datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet, 3D Faces, and CelebA, and confirmed that the DTLC-GAN can learn hierarchically interpretable representations with either unsupervised or weakly supervised settings. Furthermore, we applied the DTLC-GAN to image-retrieval tasks and showed its effectiveness in representation learning. 
### 541.Deployment of Customized Deep Learning based Video Analytics On  Surveillance Cameras [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10604.pdf)
> This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of our customized deep learning based video analytics system in various applications focused on security, safety, customer analytics and process compliance. We describe our video analytics system comprising of Search, Summarize, Statistics and real-time alerting, and outline its building blocks. These building blocks include object detection, tracking, face detection and recognition, human and face sub-attribute analytics. In each case, we demonstrate how custom models trained using data from the deployment scenarios provide considerably superior accuracies than off-the-shelf models. Towards this end, we describe our data processing and model training pipeline, which can train and fine-tune models from videos with a quick turnaround time. Finally, since most of these models are deployed on-site, it is important to have resource constrained models which do not require GPUs. We demonstrate how we custom train resource constrained models and deploy them on embedded devices without significant loss in accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work which provides a comprehensive evaluation of different deep learning models on various real-world customer deployment scenarios of surveillance video analytics. By sharing our implementation details and the experiences learned from deploying customized deep learning models for various customers, we hope that customized deep learning based video analytics is widely incorporated in commercial products around the world. 
### 542.Anomaly Detection and Localization in Crowded Scenes by Motion-field  Shape Description and Similarity-based Statistical Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10620.pdf)
> In crowded scenes, detection and localization of abnormal behaviors is challenging in that high-density people make object segmentation and tracking extremely difficult. We associate the optical flows of multiple frames to capture short-term trajectories and introduce the histogram-based shape descriptor referred to as shape contexts to describe such short-term trajectories. Furthermore, we propose a K-NN similarity-based statistical model to detect anomalies over time and space, which is an unsupervised one-class learning algorithm requiring no clustering nor any prior assumption. Firstly, we retrieve the K-NN samples from the training set in regard to the testing sample, and then use the similarities between every pair of the K-NN samples to construct a Gaussian model. Finally, the probabilities of the similarities from the testing sample to the K-NN samples under the Gaussian model are calculated in the form of a joint probability. Abnormal events can be detected by judging whether the joint probability is below predefined thresholds in terms of time and space, separately. Such a scheme can adapt to the whole scene, since the probability computed as such is not affected by motion distortions arising from perspective distortion. We conduct experiments on real-world surveillance videos, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can reliably detect and locate the abnormal events in the video sequences, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 543.A Simple Riemannian Manifold Network for Image Set Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10628.pdf)
> In the domain of image-set based classification, a considerable advance has been made by representing original image sets as covariance matrices which typical lie in a Riemannian manifold. Specifically, it is a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold. Traditional manifold learning methods inevitably have the property of high computational complexity or weak performance of the feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a very simple Riemannian manifold network for image set classification. Inspired by deep learning architectures, we design a fully connected layer to generate more novel, more powerful SPD matrices. However we exploit the rectifying layer to prevent the input SPD matrices from being singular. We also introduce a non-linear learning of the proposed network with an innovative objective function. Furthermore we devise a pooling layer to further reduce the redundancy of the input SPD matrices, and the log-map layer to project the SPD manifold to the Euclidean space. For learning the connection weights between the input layer and the fully connected layer, we use Two-directional two-dimensional Principal Component Analysis ((2D)2PCA) algorithm. The proposed Riemannian manifold network (RieMNet) avoids complex computing and can be built and trained extremely easy and efficient. We have also developed a deep version of RieMNet, named as DRieMNet. The proposed RieMNet and DRieMNet are evaluated on three tasks: video-based face recognition, set-based object categorization, and set-based cell identification. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art. 
### 544.Towards Multifocal Displays with Dense Focal Stacks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10664.pdf)
> We present a virtual reality display that is capable of generating a dense collection of depth/focal planes. This is achieved by driving a focus-tunable lens to sweep a range of focal lengths at a high frequency and, subsequently, tracking the focal length precisely at microsecond time resolutions using an optical module. Precise tracking of the focal length, coupled with a high-speed display, enables our lab prototype to generate 1600 focal planes per second. This enables a novel first-of-its-kind virtual reality multifocal display that is capable of resolving the vergence-accommodation conflict endemic to today's displays. 
### 545.Synergistic Reconstruction and Synthesis via Generative Adversarial  Networks for Accelerated Multi-Contrast MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10704.pdf)
> Multi-contrast MRI acquisitions of an anatomy enrich the magnitude of information available for diagnosis. Yet, excessive scan times associated with additional contrasts may be a limiting factor. Two mainstream approaches for enhanced scan efficiency are reconstruction of undersampled acquisitions and synthesis of missing acquisitions. In reconstruction, performance decreases towards higher acceleration factors with diminished sampling density particularly at high-spatial-frequencies. In synthesis, the absence of data samples from the target contrast can lead to artefactual sensitivity or insensitivity to image features. Here we propose a new approach for synergistic reconstruction-synthesis of multi-contrast MRI based on conditional generative adversarial networks. The proposed method preserves high-frequency details of the target contrast by relying on the shared high-frequency information available from the source contrast, and prevents feature leakage or loss by relying on the undersampled acquisitions of the target contrast. Demonstrations on brain MRI datasets from healthy subjects and patients indicate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to previous state-of-the-art. The proposed method can help improve the quality and scan efficiency of multi-contrast MRI exams. 
### 546.A fast minimal solver for absolute camera pose with unknown focal length  and radial distortion from four planar points [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10705.pdf)
> In this paper we present a fast minimal solver for absolute camera pose estimation from four known points that lie in a plane. We assume a perspective camera model with unknown focal length and unknown radial distortion. The radial distortion is modelled using the division model with one parameter. We show that the solutions to this problem can be found from a univariate six-degree polynomial. This results in a very fast and numerically stable solver. 
### 547.High Quality Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10717.pdf)
> Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved outstanding success in generating the high quality data. Focusing on the generation process, existing GANs investigate unidirectional mapping from the latent vector to the data. Later, various studies point out that the latent space of GANs is semantically meaningful and can be utilized in advanced data analysis and manipulation. In order to analyze the real data in the latent space of GANs, it is necessary to investigate the inverse generation mapping from the data to the latent vector. To tackle this problem, the bidirectional generative models introduce an encoder to enable the inverse path of generation process. Unfortunately, this effort leads to the degradation of generation quality because the imperfect generator rather interferes the encoder training and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a new inference model that estimates the latent vector from the feature of GAN discriminator. While existing bidirectional models learns the image to latent translation, our algorithm formulates this inference mapping by the feature to latent translation. It is important to note that training of our model is independent of the GAN training. Owing to the attractive nature of this independency, the proposed algorithm can generate the high quality samples identical to those of unidirectional GANs and also reconstruct the original data faithfully. Moreover, our algorithm can be employed to any unidirectional GAN, even the pre-traind GANs. 
### 548.Multi-region segmentation of bladder cancer structures in MRI with  progressive dilated convolutional networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10720.pdf)
> Precise segmentation of bladder walls and tumor regions is an essential step towards non-invasive identification of tumor stage and grade, which is critical for treatment decision and prognosis of patients with bladder cancer (BC). However, the automatic delineation of bladder walls and tumor in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is a challenging task, due to important bladder shape variations, strong intensity inhomogeneity in urine and very high variability across population, particularly on tumors appearance. To tackle these issues, we propose to use a deep fully convolutional neural network. The proposed network includes dilated convolutions to increase the receptive field without incurring extra cost nor degrading its performance. Furthermore, we introduce progressive dilations in each convolutional block, thereby enabling extensive receptive fields without the need for large dilation rates. The proposed network is evaluated on 3.0T T2-weighted MRI scans from 60 pathologically confirmed patients with BC. Experiments shows the proposed model to achieve high accuracy, with a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.98, 0.84 and 0.69 for inner wall, outer wall and tumor region, respectively. These results represent a very good agreement with reference contours and an increase in performance compared to existing methods. In addition, inference times are less than a second for a whole 3D volume, which is between 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than related state-of-the-art methods for this application. We showed that a CNN can yield precise segmentation of bladder walls and tumors in bladder cancer patients on MRI. The whole segmentation process is fully-automatic and yields results in very good agreement with the reference standard, demonstrating the viability of deep learning models for the automatic multi-region segmentation of bladder cancer MRI images. 
### 549.A Neurobiological Cross-domain Evaluation Metric for Predictive Coding  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10726.pdf)
> Achieving a good measure of model generalization remains a challenge within machine learning. One of the highest-performing learning models is the biological brain, which has unparalleled generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose and evaluate a human-model similarity metric for determining model correspondence to the human brain, as inspired by representational similarity analysis. We evaluate this metric on unsupervised predictive coding networks. These models are designed to mimic the phenomenon of residual error propagation in the visual cortex, implying their potential for biological fidelity. The human-model similarity metric is calculated by measuring the similarity between human brain fMRI activations and predictive coding network activations over a shared set of stimuli. In order to study our metric in relation to standard performance evaluations on cross-domain tasks, we train a multitude of predictive coding models across various conditions. Each unsupervised model is trained on next frame prediction in video and evaluated using three metrics: 1) mean squared error of next frame prediction, 2) object matching accuracy, and 3) our human-model similarity metric. Through this evaluation, we show that models with higher human-model similarity are more likely to generalize to cross-domain tasks. We also show that our metric facilitates a substantial decrease in model search time because the similarity metric stabilizes quickly --- in as few as 10 epochs. We propose that this metric could be deployed in model search to quickly identify and eliminate weaker models. 
### 550.Deep Adversarial Context-Aware Landmark Detection for Ultrasound Imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10737.pdf)
> Real-time localization of prostate gland in trans-rectal ultrasound images is a key technology that is required to automate the ultrasound guided prostate biopsy procedures. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning based approach which is aimed at localizing several prostate landmarks efficiently and robustly. We propose a multitask learning approach primarily to make the overall algorithm more contextually aware. In this approach, we not only consider the explicit learning of landmark locations, but also build-in a mechanism to learn the contour of the prostate. This multitask learning is further coupled with an adversarial arm to promote the generation of feasible structures. We have trained this network using ~4000 labeled trans-rectal ultrasound images and tested on an independent set of images with ground truth landmark locations. We have achieved an overall Dice score of 92.6% for the adversarially trained multitask approach, which is significantly better than the Dice score of 88.3% obtained by only learning of landmark locations. The overall mean distance error using the adversarial multitask approach has also improved by 20% while reducing the standard deviation of the error compared to learning landmark locations only. In terms of computational complexity both approaches can process the images in real-time using standard computer with a standard CUDA enabled GPU. 
### 551.Learning Instance-Aware Object Detection Using Determinantal Point  Processes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10765.pdf)
> Recent object detectors find instances while categorizing candidate regions in an input image. As each region is evaluated independently, the number of candidate regions from a detector is usually larger than the number of objects. Since the final goal of detection is to assign a single detection to each object, an additional algorithm, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS), is used to select a single bounding box for an object. While simple heuristic algorithms, such as NMS, are effective for stand-alone objects, they can fail to detect overlapped objects. In this paper, we address this issue by training a network to distinguish different objects while localizing and categorizing them. We propose an instance-aware detection network (IDNet), which can learn to extract features from candidate regions and measures their similarities. Based on pairwise similarities and detection qualities, the IDNet selects an optimal subset of candidate bounding boxes using determinantal point processes (DPPs). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably compared to existing state-of-the-art detection methods particularly for overlapped objects on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. 
### 552.Improving the Resolution of CNN Feature Maps Efficiently with  Multisampling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10766.pdf)
> We describe a new class of subsampling techniques for CNNs, termed multisampling, that significantly increases the amount of information kept by feature maps through subsampling layers. One version of our method, which we call checkered subsampling, significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art architectures such as DenseNet and ResNet without any additional parameters and, remarkably, improves the accuracy of certain pretrained ImageNet models without any training or fine-tuning. We glean new insight into the nature of data augmentations and demonstrate, for the first time, that coarse feature maps are significantly bottlenecking the performance of neural networks in image classification. 
### 553.Object-Level Representation Learning for Few-Shot Image Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10777.pdf)
> Few-shot learning that trains image classifiers over few labeled examples per category is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose to exploit an additional big dataset with different categories to improve the accuracy of few-shot learning over our target dataset. Our approach is based on the observation that images can be decomposed into objects, which may appear in images from both the additional dataset and our target dataset. We use the object-level relation learned from the additional dataset to infer the similarity of images in our target dataset with unseen categories. Nearest neighbor search is applied to do image classification, which is a non-parametric model and thus does not need fine-tuning. We evaluate our algorithm on two popular datasets, namely Omniglot and MiniImagenet. We obtain 8.5\% and 2.7\% absolute improvements for 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot experiments on MiniImagenet, respectively. Source code will be published upon acceptance. 
### 554.Keep and Learn: Continual Learning by Constraining the Latent Space for  Knowledge Preservation in Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10784.pdf)
> Data is one of the most important factors in machine learning. However, even if we have high-quality data, there is a situation in which access to the data is restricted. For example, access to the medical data from outside is strictly limited due to the privacy issues. In this case, we have to learn a model sequentially only with the data accessible in the corresponding stage. In this work, we propose a new method for preserving learned knowledge by modeling the high-level feature space and the output space to be mutually informative, and constraining feature vectors to lie in the modeled space during training. The proposed method is easy to implement as it can be applied by simply adding a reconstruction loss to an objective function. We evaluate the proposed method on CIFAR-10/100 and a chest X-ray dataset, and show benefits in terms of knowledge preservation compared to previous approaches. 
### 555.Deep CT to MR Synthesis using Paired and Unpaired Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10790.pdf)
> MR imaging will play a very important role in radiotherapy treatment planning for segmentation of tumor volumes and organs. However, the use of MR-based radiotherapy is limited because of the high cost and the increased use of metal implants such as cardiac pacemakers and artificial joints in aging society. To improve the accuracy of CT-based radiotherapy planning, we propose a synthetic approach that translates a CT image into an MR image using paired and unpaired training data. In contrast to the current synthetic methods for medical images, which depend on sparse pairwise-aligned data or plentiful unpaired data, the proposed approach alleviates the rigid registration challenge of paired training and overcomes the context-misalignment problem of the unpaired training. A generative adversarial network was trained to transform 2D brain CT image slices into 2D brain MR image slices, combining adversarial loss, dual cycle-consistent loss, and voxel-wise loss. The experiments were analyzed using CT and MR images of 202 patients. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons against independent paired training and unpaired training methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach. 
### 556.Deep Discriminative Latent Space for Clustering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10795.pdf)
> Clustering is one of the most fundamental tasks in data analysis and machine learning. It is central to many data-driven applications that aim to separate the data into groups with similar patterns. Moreover, clustering is a complex procedure that is affected significantly by the choice of the data representation method. Recent research has demonstrated encouraging clustering results by learning effectively these representations. In most of these works a deep auto-encoder is initially pre-trained to minimize a reconstruction loss, and then jointly optimized with clustering centroids in order to improve the clustering objective. Those works focus mainly on the clustering phase of the procedure, while not utilizing the potential benefit out of the initial phase. In this paper we propose to optimize an auto-encoder with respect to a discriminative pairwise loss function during the auto-encoder pre-training phase. We demonstrate the high accuracy obtained by the proposed method as well as its rapid convergence (e.g. reaching above 92% accuracy on MNIST during the pre-training phase, in less than 50 epochs), even with small networks. 
### 557.Visual Relationship Detection Based on Guided Proposals and Semantic  Knowledge Distillation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10802.pdf)
> A thorough comprehension of image content demands a complex grasp of the interactions that may occur in the natural world. One of the key issues is to describe the visual relationships between objects. When dealing with real world data, capturing these very diverse interactions is a difficult problem. It can be alleviated by incorporating common sense in a network. For this, we propose a framework that makes use of semantic knowledge and estimates the relevance of object pairs during both training and test phases. Extracted from precomputed models and training annotations, this information is distilled into the neural network dedicated to this task. Using this approach, we observe a significant improvement on all classes of Visual Genome, a challenging visual relationship dataset. A 68.5% relative gain on the recall at 100 is directly related to the relevance estimate and a 32.7% gain to the knowledge distillation. 
### 558.Fast Dynamic Routing Based on Weighted Kernel Density Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10807.pdf)
> Capsules as well as dynamic routing between them are most recently proposed structures for deep neural networks. A capsule groups data into vectors or matrices as poses rather than conventional scalars to represent specific properties of target instance. Besides of pose, a capsule should be attached with a probability (often denoted as activation) for its presence. The dynamic routing helps capsules achieve more generalization capacity with many fewer model parameters. However, the bottleneck that prevents widespread applications of capsule is the expense of computation during routing. To address this problem, we generalize existing routing methods within the framework of weighted kernel density estimation, and propose two fast routing methods with different optimization strategies. Our methods prompt the time efficiency of routing by nearly 40\% with negligible performance degradation. By stacking a hybrid of convolutional layers and capsule layers, we construct a network architecture to handle inputs at a resolution of $64\times{64}$ pixels. The proposed models achieve a parallel performance with other leading methods in multiple benchmarks. 
### 559.A non-invertible cancelable fingerprint template generation based on  ridge feature transformation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10853.pdf)
> In a biometric verification system, leakage of biometric data leads to permanent identity loss since original biometric data is inherently linked to a user. Further, various types of attacks on a biometric system may reveal the original template and utility in other applications. To address these security and privacy concerns cancelable biometric has been introduced. Cancelable biometric constructs a protected template from the original biometric template using transformation functions and performs the comparison between templates in the transformed domain. Recent approaches towards cancelable fingerprint generation either rely on aligning minutiae points with respect to singular points (core/delta) or utilize the absolute coordinate positions of minutiae points. In this paper, we propose a novel non-invertible ridge feature transformation method to protect the original fingerprint template information. The proposed method partitions the fingerprint region into a number of sectors with reference to each minutia point employing a ridge-based co-ordinate system. The nearest neighbor minutiae in each sector are identified, and ridge-based features are computed. Further, a cancelable template is generated by applying the Cantor pairing function followed by random projection. We have evaluated our method with FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006 databases. It is evident from the experimental results that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in the literature. Moreover, the security analysis demonstrates that the proposed method fulfills the necessary requirements of non-invertibility, revocability, and diversity with a minor performance degradation caused due to cancelable transformation. 
### 560.Less is More: Unified Model for Unsupervised Multi-Domain Image-to-Image  Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10871.pdf)
> In this paper, we aim at solving the multi-domain image-to-image translation problem by a single GAN-based model in an unsupervised manner. In the field of image-to-image translation, most previous works mainly focus on adopting a generative adversarial network, which contains three parts, i.e., encoder, decoder and discriminator. These three parts are trained to give the encoder and the decoder together as a translator. However, the discriminator that occupies a lot of parameters is abandoned after the training process, which is wasteful of computation and memory. To handle this problem, we integrate the discriminator and the encoder of the traditional framework into a single network, where the decoder in our framework translates the information encoded by the discriminator to the target image. As a result, our framework only contains two parts, i.e., decoder and discriminator, which effectively reduces the number of the parameters of the network and achieves more effective training. Then, we expand the traditional binary-class discriminator to the multi-classes discriminator, which solves the multi-domain image-to-image translation problem in traditional settings. At last, we propose the label encoder to transform the label vector to high-dimension representation automatically rather than designing a one-hot vector manually. We performed extensive experiments on many image-to-image translation tasks including style transfer, season transfer, face hallucination, etc. A unified model was trained to translate images sampled from 14 considerable different domains and the comparisons to several recently-proposed approaches demonstrate the superiority and novelty of our framework. 
### 561.Image Distortion Detection using Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10881.pdf)
> Image distortion classification and detection is an important task in many applications. For example when compressing images, if we know the exact location of the distortion, then it is possible to re-compress images by adjusting the local compression level dynamically. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting the distortion region and classifying the distortion type of a given image. We show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art distortion classifier, and report accurate detection results for the first time. We expect that such results prove the usefulness of our approach in many potential applications such as image compression or distortion restoration. 
### 562.Training Medical Image Analysis Systems like Radiologists [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10884.pdf)
> The training of medical image analysis systems using machine learning approaches follows a common script: collect and annotate a large dataset, train the classifier on the training set, and test it on a hold-out test set. This process bears no direct resemblance with radiologist training, which is based on solving a series of tasks of increasing difficulty, where each task involves the use of significantly smaller datasets than those used in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel training approach inspired by how radiologists are trained. In particular, we explore the use of meta-training that models a classifier based on a series of tasks. Tasks are selected using teacher-student curriculum learning, where each task consists of simple classification problems containing small training sets. We hypothesize that our proposed meta-training approach can be used to pre-train medical image analysis models. This hypothesis is tested on the automatic breast screening classification from DCE-MRI trained with weakly labeled datasets. The classification performance achieved by our approach is shown to be the best in the field for that application, compared to state of art baseline approaches: DenseNet, multiple instance learning and multi-task learning. 
### 563.Online Multi-Object Tracking with Historical Appearance Matching and  Scene Adaptive Detection Filtering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10916.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose the methods to handle temporal errors during multi-object tracking. Temporal error occurs when objects are occluded or noisy detections appear near the target. In that situation, tracking may fail and various errors like drift or ID-switching occur. It is hard to overcome temporal errors only by using motion and shape information. So, we propose the historical appearance matching method and joint-input siamese network which was trained by 2-step process. It can prevent tracking failure although objects are temporally occluded or last matching information is unreliable. We also provide useful technique to remove noisy detections effectively according to scene condition. Tracking performance, especially identity consistency, is highly improved by attaching our methods. 
### 564.Face hallucination using cascaded super-resolution and identity priors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10938.pdf)
> In this paper we address the problem of hallucinating high-resolution facial images from unaligned low-resolution inputs at high magnification factors. We approach the problem with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and propose a novel (deep) face hallucination model that incorporates identity priors into the learning procedure. The model consists of two main parts: i) a cascaded super-resolution network that upscales the low-resolution images, and ii) an ensemble of face recognition models that act as identity priors for the super-resolution network during training. Different from competing super-resolution approaches that typically rely on a single model for upscaling (even with large magnification factors), our network uses a cascade of multiple SR models that progressively upscale the low-resolution images using steps of $2\times$. This characteristic allows us to apply supervision signals (target appearances) at different resolutions and incorporate identity constraints at multiple-scales. Our model is able to upscale (very) low-resolution images captured in unconstrained conditions and produce visually convincing results. We rigorously evaluate the proposed model on a large datasets of facial images and report superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art. 
### 565.Fusion of Methods Based on Minutiae, Ridges and Pores for Robust  Fingerprint Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10949.pdf)
> The use of physical and behavioral characteristics for human identification is known as biometrics. Among the many biometrics traits available, the fingerprint is the most widely used. The fingerprint identification is based on the impression patterns, as the pattern of ridges and minutiae, characteristics of first and second levels respectively. The current identification systems use these two levels of fingerprint features due to the low cost of the sensors. However, due the recent advances in sensor technology, it is possible to use third level features present within the ridges, such as the perspiration pores. Recent studies have shown that the use of third-level features can increase security and fraud protection in biometric systems, since they are difficult to reproduce. In addition, recent researches have also focused on multibiometrics recognition due to its many advantages. The goal of this work was to apply fusion techniques for fingerprint recognition in order to combine minutiae, ridges and pore-based methods and, thus, provide more robust biometrics recognition systems. We evaluated isotropic-based and adaptive-based automatic pore extraction methods and the fusion of pore-based method with the identification methods based on minutiae and ridges. The experiments were performed on the public database PolyU HRF and showed a reduction of approximately 16% in the Equal Error Rate compared to the best results obtained by the methods individually. 
### 566.Adversarial Examples in Remote Sensing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10997.pdf)
> This paper considers attacks against machine learning algorithms used in remote sensing applications, a domain that presents a suite of challenges that are not fully addressed by current research focused on natural image data such as ImageNet. In particular, we present a new study of adversarial examples in the context of satellite image classification problems. Using a recently curated data set and associated classifier, we provide a preliminary analysis of adversarial examples in settings where the targeted classifier is permitted multiple observations of the same location over time. While our experiments to date are purely digital, our problem setup explicitly incorporates a number of practical considerations that a real-world attacker would need to take into account when mounting a physical attack. We hope this work provides a useful starting point for future studies of potential vulnerabilities in this setting. 
### 567.BlockCNN: A Deep Network for Artifact Removal and Image Compression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11091.pdf)
> We present a general technique that performs both artifact removal and image compression. For artifact removal, we input a JPEG image and try to remove its compression artifacts. For compression, we input an image and process its 8 by 8 blocks in a sequence. For each block, we first try to predict its intensities based on previous blocks; then, we store a residual with respect to the input image. Our technique reuses JPEG's legacy compression and decompression routines. Both our artifact removal and our image compression techniques use the same deep network, but with different training weights. Our technique is simple and fast and it significantly improves the performance of artifact removal and image compression. 
### 568.Adding New Tasks to a Single Network with Weight Transformations using  Binary Masks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11119.pdf)
> Visual recognition algorithms are required today to exhibit adaptive abilities. Given a deep model trained on a specific, given task, it would be highly desirable to be able to adapt incrementally to new tasks, preserving scalability as the number of new tasks increases, while at the same time avoiding catastrophic forgetting issues. Recent work has shown that masking the internal weights of a given original conv-net through learned binary variables is a promising strategy. We build upon this intuition and take into account more elaborated affine transformations of the convolutional weights that include learned binary masks. We show that with our generalization it is possible to achieve significantly higher levels of adaptation to new tasks, enabling the approach to compete with fine tuning strategies by requiring slightly more than 1 bit per network parameter per additional task. Experiments on two popular benchmarks showcase the power of our approach, that achieves the new state of the art on the Visual Decathlon Challenge. 
### 569.Object Counting with Small Datasets of Large Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11123.pdf)
> We explore the problem of training one-look regression models for counting objects in datasets comprising a small number of high-resolution, variable-shaped images. To reduce overfitting when training on full resolution samples, we propose to use global sum pooling (GSP) instead of global average pooling (GAP) or fully connected (FC) layers at the backend of a convolutional neural network. Although computationally equivalent to GAP, we show via detailed experimentation that GSP allows convolutional networks to learn the counting task as a simple linear mapping problem generalized over the input shape and the number of objects present. We evaluate our approach on four different aerial image datasets - three car counting datasets (CARPK, PUCPR+, and COWC) and one new challenging dataset for wheat spike counting. Our GSP approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all four datasets and GSP models trained with smaller-sized image patches localize objects better than their GAP counterparts. 
### 570.Exemplar Guided Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11145.pdf)
> Image-to-image translation task has become a popular topic recently. Most works focus on either one-to-one mapping in an unsupervised way or many-to-many mapping in a supervised way. However, a more practical setting is many-to-many mapping in an unsupervised way, which is harder due to the lack of supervision and the complex inner and cross-domain variations. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Exemplar Guided UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation (EG-UNIT) network which conditions the image translation process on an image in the target domain. An image representation is assumed to comprise both content information which is shared across domains and style information specific to one domain. By applying exemplar-based adaptive instance normalization to the shared content representation, EG-UNIT manages to transfer the style information in the target domain to the source domain. Experimental results on various datasets show that EG-UNIT can indeed translate the source image to diverse instances in the target domain with semantic consistency. 
### 571.Confidence Prediction for Lexicon-Free OCR [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11161.pdf)
> Having a reliable accuracy score is crucial for real world applications of OCR, since such systems are judged by the number of false readings. Lexicon-based OCR systems, which deal with what is essentially a multi-class classification problem, often employ methods explicitly taking into account the lexicon, in order to improve accuracy. However, in lexicon-free scenarios, filtering errors requires an explicit confidence calculation. In this work we show two explicit confidence measurement techniques, and show that they are able to achieve a significant reduction in misreads on both standard benchmarks and a proprietary dataset. 
### 572.Towards computational fluorescence microscopy: Machine learning-based  integrated prediction of morphological and molecular tumor profiles [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11178.pdf)
> Recent advances in cancer research largely rely on new developments in microscopic or molecular profiling techniques offering high level of detail with respect to either spatial or molecular features, but usually not both. Here, we present a novel machine learning-based computational approach that allows for the identification of morphological tissue features and the prediction of molecular properties from breast cancer imaging data. This integration of microanatomic information of tumors with complex molecular profiling data, including protein or gene expression, copy number variation, gene methylation and somatic mutations, provides a novel means to computationally score molecular markers with respect to their relevance to cancer and their spatial associations within the tumor microenvironment. 
### 573.Learning From Less Data: Diversified Subset Selection and Active  Learning in Image Classification Tasks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11191.pdf)
> Supervised machine learning based state-of-the-art computer vision techniques are in general data hungry and pose the challenges of not having adequate computing resources and of high costs involved in human labeling efforts. Training data subset selection and active learning techniques have been proposed as possible solutions to these challenges respectively. A special class of subset selection functions naturally model notions of diversity, coverage and representation and they can be used to eliminate redundancy and thus lend themselves well for training data subset selection. They can also help improve the efficiency of active learning in further reducing human labeling efforts by selecting a subset of the examples obtained using the conventional uncertainty sampling based techniques. In this work we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of two diversity models, namely the Facility-Location and Disparity-Min models for training-data subset selection and reducing labeling effort. We do this for a variety of computer vision tasks including Gender Recognition, Scene Recognition and Object Recognition. Our results show that subset selection done in the right way can add 2-3% in accuracy on existing baselines, particularly in the case of less training data. This allows the training of complex machine learning models (like Convolutional Neural Networks) with much less training data while incurring minimal performance loss. 
### 574.CapsNet comparative performance evaluation for image classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11195.pdf)
> Image classification has become one of the main tasks in the field of computer vision technologies. In this context, a recent algorithm called CapsNet that implements an approach based on activity vectors and dynamic routing between capsules may overcome some of the limitations of the current state of the art artificial neural networks (ANN) classifiers, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the CapsNet algorithm in comparison with three well-known classifiers (Fisher-faces, LeNet, and ResNet). We tested the classification accuracy on four datasets with a different number of instances and classes, including images of faces, traffic signs, and everyday objects. The evaluation results show that even for simple architectures, training the CapsNet algorithm requires significant computational resources and its classification performance falls below the average accuracy values of the other three classifiers. However, we argue that CapsNet seems to be a promising new technique for image classification, and further experiments using more robust computation resources and re-fined CapsNet architectures may produce better outcomes. 
### 575.Automatic Exposure Compensation for Multi-Exposure Image Fusion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11211.pdf)
> This paper proposes a novel luminance adjustment method based on automatic exposure compensation for multi-exposure image fusion. Multi-exposure image fusion is a method to produce images without saturation regions, by using photos with different exposures. In conventional works, it has been pointed out that the quality of those multi-exposure images can be improved by adjusting the luminance of them. However, how to determine the degree of adjustment has never been discussed. This paper therefore proposes a way to automatically determines the degree on the basis of the luminance distribution of input multi-exposure images. Moreover, new weights, called "simple weights", for image fusion are also considered for the proposed luminance adjustment method. Experimental results show that the multi-exposure images adjusted by the proposed method have better quality than the input multi-exposure ones in terms of the well-exposedness. It is also confirmed that the proposed simple weights provide the highest score of statistical naturalness and discrete entropy in all fusion methods. 
### 576.Non-rigid Reconstruction with a Single Moving RGB-D Camera [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11219.pdf)
> We present a novel non-rigid reconstruction method using a moving RGB-D camera. Current approaches use only non-rigid part of the scene and completely ignore the rigid background. Non-rigid parts often lack sufficient geometric and photometric information for tracking large frame-to-frame motion. Our approach uses camera pose estimated from the rigid background for foreground tracking. This enables robust foreground tracking in situations where large frame-to-frame motion occurs. Moreover, we are proposing a multi-scale deformation graph which improves non-rigid tracking without compromising the quality of the reconstruction. We are also contributing a synthetic dataset which is made publically available for evaluating non-rigid reconstruction methods. The dataset provides frame-by-frame ground truth geometry of the scene, the camera trajectory, and masks for background foreground. Experimental results show that our approach is more robust in handling larger frame-to-frame motions and provides better reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 577.Video Anomaly Detection and Localization via Gaussian Mixture Fully  Convolutional Variational Autoencoder [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11223.pdf)
> We present a novel end-to-end partially supervised deep learning approach for video anomaly detection and localization using only normal samples. The insight that motivates this study is that the normal samples can be associated with at least one Gaussian component of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), while anomalies either do not belong to any Gaussian component. The method is based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder, which can learn feature representations of the normal samples as a Gaussian Mixture Model trained using deep learning. A Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) that does not contain a fully-connected layer is employed for the encoder-decoder structure to preserve relative spatial coordinates between the input image and the output feature map. Based on the joint probabilities of each of the Gaussian mixture components, we introduce a sample energy based method to score the anomaly of image test patches. A two-stream network framework is employed to combine the appearance and motion anomalies, using RGB frames for the former and dynamic flow images, for the latter. We test our approach on two popular benchmarks (UCSD Dataset and Avenue Dataset). The experimental results verify the superiority of our method compared to the state of the arts. 
### 578.Getting to Know Low-light Images with The Exclusively Dark Dataset [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11227.pdf)
> Low-light is an inescapable element of our daily surroundings that greatly affects the efficiency of our vision. Research works on low-light has seen a steady growth, particularly in the field of image enhancement, but there is still a lack of a go-to database as benchmark. Besides, research fields that may assist us in low-light environments, such as object detection, has glossed over this aspect even though breakthroughs-after-breakthroughs had been achieved in recent years, most noticeably from the lack of low-light data (less than 2% of the total images) in successful public benchmark dataset such as PASCAL VOC, ImageNet, and Microsoft COCO. Thus, we propose the Exclusively Dark dataset to elevate this data drought, consisting exclusively of ten different types of low-light images (i.e. low, ambient, object, single, weak, strong, screen, window, shadow and twilight) captured in visible light only with image and object level annotations. Moreover, we share insightful findings in regards to the effects of low-light on the object detection task by analyzing visualizations of both hand-crafted and learned features. Most importantly, we found that the effects of low-light reaches far deeper into the features than can be solved by simple "illumination invariance'". It is our hope that this analysis and the Exclusively Dark dataset can encourage the growth in low-light domain researches on different fields. The Exclusively Dark dataset with its annotation is available at <a href="https://github.com/cs-chan/Exclusively-Dark-Image-Dataset">this https URL</a> 
### 579.Microscopy Cell Segmentation via Convolutional LSTM Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11247.pdf)
> Live cell microscopy sequences exhibit complex spatial structures and complicated temporal behaviour, making their analysis a challenging task. Considering cell segmentation problem, which plays a significant role in the analysis, the spatial properties of the data can be captured using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Recent approaches show promising segmentation results using convolutional encoder-decoders such as the U-Net. Nevertheless, these methods are limited by their inability to incorporate temporal information, that can facilitate segmentation of individual touching cells or of cells that are partially visible. In order to accommodate cell dynamics we propose a novel segmentation approach which integrates Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (C-LSTM) with the U-Net. The network's unique architecture allows it to capture multi-scale, compact, spatio-temporal encoding in the C-LSTMs memory units. Promising results, surpassing the state-of-the-art, are presented. The code is freely available at: TBD 
### 580.Improved Mixed-Example Data Augmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11272.pdf)
> In order to reduce overfitting, neural networks are typically trained with data augmentation, the practice of artificially generating additional training data via label-preserving transformations of existing training examples. Recent work has demonstrated a surprisingly effective type of non-label-preserving data augmentation, in which pairs of training examples are averaged together. In this work, we generalize this "mixed-example data augmentation", which allows us to find methods that improve upon previous work. This generalization also reveals that linearity is not necessary as an inductive bias in order for mixed-example data augmentation to be effective, providing evidence against the primary theoretical hypothesis from prior work. 
### 581.Learning Data Augmentation for Brain Tumor Segmentation with  Coarse-to-Fine Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11291.pdf)
> There is a common belief that the successful training of deep neural networks requires many annotated training samples, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain especially in the biomedical imaging field. While it is often easy for researchers to use data augmentation to expand the size of training sets, constructing and generating generic augmented data that is able to teach the network the desired invariance and robustness properties using traditional data augmentation techniques is challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic data augmentation method that uses generative adversarial networks to learn augmentations that enable machine learning based method to learn the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a coarse-to-fine generator to capture the manifold of the training sets and generate generic augmented data. In our experiments, we show the efficacy of our approach on a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image, achieving improvements of 3.5% Dice coefficient on the BRATS15 Challenge dataset as compared to traditional augmentation approaches. Also, our proposed method successfully boosts a common segmentation network to reach the state-of-the-art performance on the BRATS15 Challenge. 
### 582.Lightweight Probabilistic Deep Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11327.pdf)
> Even though probabilistic treatments of neural networks have a long history, they have not found widespread use in practice. Sampling approaches are often too slow already for simple networks. The size of the inputs and the depth of typical CNN architectures in computer vision only compound this problem. Uncertainty in neural networks has thus been largely ignored in practice, despite the fact that it may provide important information about the reliability of predictions and the inner workings of the network. In this paper, we introduce two lightweight approaches to making supervised learning with probabilistic deep networks practical: First, we suggest probabilistic output layers for classification and regression that require only minimal changes to existing networks. Second, we employ assumed density filtering and show that activation uncertainties can be propagated in a practical fashion through the entire network, again with minor changes. Both probabilistic networks retain the predictive power of the deterministic counterpart, but yield uncertainties that correlate well with the empirical error induced by their predictions. Moreover, the robustness to adversarial examples is significantly increased. 
### 583.Pointly-Supervised Action Localization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11333.pdf)
> This paper strives for spatio-temporal localization of human actions in videos. In the literature, the consensus is to achieve localization by training on bounding box annotations provided for each frame of each training video. As annotating boxes in video is expensive, cumbersome and error-prone, we propose to bypass box-supervision. Instead, we introduce action localization based on point-supervision. We start from unsupervised spatio-temporal proposals, which provide a set of candidate regions in videos. While normally used exclusively for inference, we show spatio-temporal proposals can also be leveraged during training when guided by a sparse set of point annotations. We introduce an overlap measure between points and spatio-temporal proposals and incorporate them all into a new objective of a Multiple Instance Learning optimization. During inference, we introduce pseudo-points, visual cues from videos, that automatically guide the selection of spatio-temporal proposals. We outline five spatial and one temporal pseudo-point, as well as a measure to best leverage pseudo-points at test time. Experimental evaluation on three action localization datasets shows our pointly-supervised approach (i) is as effective as traditional box-supervision at a fraction of the annotation cost, (ii) is robust to sparse and noisy point annotations, (iii) benefits from pseudo-points during inference, and (iv) outperforms recent weakly-supervised alternatives. This leads us to conclude that points provide a viable alternative to boxes for action localization. 
### 584.Uncertainty Gated Network for Land Cover Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11348.pdf)
> The production of thematic maps depicting land cover is one of the most common applications of remote sensing. To this end, several semantic segmentation approaches, based on deep learning, have been proposed in the literature, but land cover segmentation is still considered an open problem due to some specific problems related to remote sensing imaging. In this paper we propose a novel approach to deal with the problem of modelling multiscale contexts surrounding pixels of different land cover categories. The approach leverages the computation of a heteroscedastic measure of uncertainty when classifying individual pixels in an image. This classification uncertainty measure is used to define a set of memory gates between layers that allow a principled method to select the optimal decision for each pixel. 
### 585.CocoNet: A deep neural network for mapping pixel coordinates to color  values [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11357.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a deep neural network approach for mapping the 2D pixel coordinates in an image to the corresponding Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color values. The neural network is termed CocoNet, i.e. coordinates-to-color network. During the training process, the neural network learns to encode the input image within its layers. More specifically, the network learns a continuous function that approximates the discrete RGB values sampled over the discrete 2D pixel locations. At test time, given a 2D pixel coordinate, the neural network will output the approximate RGB values of the corresponding pixel. By considering every 2D pixel location, the network can actually reconstruct the entire learned image. It is important to note that we have to train an individual neural network for each input image, i.e. one network encodes a single image only. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a neural approach for encoding images individually, by learning a mapping from the 2D pixel coordinate space to the RGB color space. Our neural image encoding approach has various low-level image processing applications ranging from image encoding, image compression and image denoising to image resampling and image completion. We conduct experiments that include both quantitative and qualitative results, demonstrating the utility of our approach and its superiority over standard baselines, e.g. bilateral filtering or bicubic interpolation. Our code is available at <a href="https://github.com/paubric/python-fuse-coconet.">this https URL</a> 
### 586.&quot;How to rate a video game?&quot; - A prediction system for video games based  on multimodal information [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11372.pdf)
> Video games have become an integral part of most people's lives in recent times. This led to an abundance of data related to video games being shared online. However, this comes with issues such as incorrect ratings, reviews or anything that is being shared. Recommendation systems are powerful tools that help users by providing them with meaningful recommendations. A straightforward approach would be to predict the scores of video games based on other information related to the game. It could be used as a means to validate user-submitted ratings as well as provide recommendations. This work provides a method to predict the G-Score, that defines how good a video game is, from its trailer (video) and summary (text). We first propose models to predict the G-Score based on the trailer alone (unimodal). Later on, we show that considering information from multiple modalities helps the models perform better compared to using information from videos alone. Since we couldn't find any suitable multimodal video game dataset, we created our own dataset named VGD (Video Game Dataset) and provide it along with this work. The approach mentioned here can be generalized to other multimodal datasets such as movie trailers and summaries etc. Towards the end, we talk about the shortcomings of the work and some methods to overcome them. 
### 587.Webpage Saliency Prediction with Two-stage Generative Adversarial  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11374.pdf)
> Web page saliency prediction is a challenge problem in image transformation and computer vision. In this paper, we propose a new model combined with web page outline information to prediction people's interest region in web page. For each web page image, our model can generate the saliency map which indicates the region of interest for people. A two-stage generative adversarial networks are proposed and image outline information is introduced for better transferring. Experiment results on FIWI dataset show that our model have better performance in terms of saliency prediction. 
### 588.Robust Tumor Localization with Pyramid Grad-CAM [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11393.pdf)
> A meningioma is a type of brain tumor that requires tumor volume size follow ups in order to reach appropriate clinical decisions. A fully automated tool for meningioma detection is necessary for reliable and consistent tumor surveillance. There have been various studies concerning automated lesion detection. Studies on the application of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods, which have achieved a state-of-the-art level of performance in various computer vision tasks, have been carried out. However, the applicable diseases are limited, owing to a lack of strongly annotated data being present in medical image analysis. In order to resolve the above issue we propose pyramid gradient-based class activation mapping (PG-CAM) which is a novel method for tumor localization that can be trained in weakly supervised manner. PG-CAM uses a densely connected encoder-decoder-based feature pyramid network (DC-FPN) as a backbone structure, and extracts a multi-scale Grad-CAM that captures hierarchical features of a tumor. We tested our model using meningioma brain magnetic resonance (MR) data collected from the collaborating hospital. In our experiments, PG-CAM outperformed Grad-CAM by delivering a 23 percent higher localization accuracy for the validation set. 
### 589.A novel channel pruning method for deep neural network compression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11394.pdf)
> In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved great success in the field of computer vision. However, it is still a big challenge to deploy these deep models on resource-constrained embedded devices such as mobile robots, smart phones and so on. Therefore, network compression for such platforms is a reasonable solution to reduce memory consumption and computation complexity. In this paper, a novel channel pruning method based on genetic algorithm is proposed to compress very deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). Firstly, a pre-trained CNN model is pruned layer by layer according to the sensitivity of each layer. After that, the pruned model is fine-tuned based on knowledge distillation framework. These two improvements significantly decrease the model redundancy with less accuracy drop. Channel selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that has exponential solution space. In order to accelerate the selection process, the proposed method formulates it as a search problem, which can be solved efficiently by genetic algorithm. Meanwhile, a two-step approximation fitness function is designed to further improve the efficiency of genetic process. The proposed method has been verified on three benchmark datasets with two popular CNN models: VGGNet and ResNet. On the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. On the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets, the pruned VGGNet achieves better performance than the original model with 8 times parameters compression and 3 times FLOPs reduction. 
### 590.Rice Classification Using Spatio-Spectral Deep Convolutional Neural  Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11491.pdf)
> Rice has been one of the staple foods that contribute significantly to human food supplies. Numerous rice varieties have been cultivated, imported, and exported worldwide. Different rice varieties could be mixed during rice production and trading. Rice impurities could damage the trust between rice importers and exporters, calling for the need to develop a rice variety inspection system. In this work, we develop a non-destructive rice variety classification system that benefits from the synergy between hyperspectral imaging and deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed method uses a hyperspectral imaging system to simultaneously acquire complementary spatial and spectral information of rice seeds. The rice varieties are then determined from the acquired spatio-spectral data using a deep CNN. As opposed to several existing rice variety classification methods that require hand-engineered features, the proposed method automatically extracts features from the raw sensor data. As demonstrated using two types of rice datasets, the proposed method achieved up to 8% relative improvement in the classification accuracy compared to the commonly used classification methods based on support vector machines. 
### 591.Capturing Variabilities from Computed Tomography Images with Generative  Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11504.pdf)
> With the advent of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), data augmentation and generation are quickly evolving domains that have raised much interest recently. However, the DL techniques are data demanding and since, medical data is not easily accessible, they suffer from data insufficiency. To deal with this limitation, different data augmentation techniques are used. Here, we propose a novel unsupervised data-driven approach for data augmentation that can generate 2D Computed Tomography (CT) images using a simple GAN. The generated CT images have good global and local features of a real CT image and can be used to augment the training datasets for effective learning. In this proof-of-concept study, we show that our proposed solution using GANs is able to capture some of the global and local CT variabilities. Our network is able to generate visually realistic CT images and we aim to further enhance its output by scaling it to a higher resolution and potentially from 2D to 3D. 
### 592.Face Recognition in Low Quality Images: A Survey [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11519.pdf)
> Low-resolution face recognition (LRFR) has received increasing attention over the past few years. Its applications lie widely in the real-world environment when high-resolution or high-quality images are hard to capture. One of the biggest demands for LRFR technologies is video surveillance. As the the number of surveillance cameras in the city increases, the videos that captured will need to be processed automatically. However, those videos or images are usually captured with large standoffs, arbitrary illumination condition, and diverse angles of view. Faces in these images are generally small in size. Several studies addressed this problem employed techniques like super resolution, deblurring, or learning a relationship between different resolution domains. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of approaches to low-resolution face recognition in the past five years. First, a general problem definition is given. Later, systematically analysis of the works on this topic is presented by catogory. In addition to describing the methods, we also focus on datasets and experiment settings. We further address the related works on unconstrained low-resolution face recognition and compare them with the result that use synthetic low-resolution data. Finally, we summarized the general limitations and speculate a priorities for the future effort. 
### 593.Low Resolution Face Recognition in the Wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11529.pdf)
> Although face recognition systems have achieved impressive performance in recent years, the low-resolution face recognition (LRFR) task remains challenging, especially when the LR faces are captured under non-ideal conditions, as is common in surveillance-based applications. Faces captured in such conditions are often contaminated by blur, nonuniform lighting, and nonfrontal face pose. In this paper, we analyze face recognition techniques using data captured under low-quality conditions in the wild. We provide a comprehensive analysis of experimental results for two of the most important applications in real surveillance applications, and demonstrate practical approaches to handle both cases that show promising performance. The following three contributions are made: {\em (i)} we conduct experiments to evaluate super-resolution methods for low-resolution face recognition; {\em (ii)} we study face re-identification on various public face datasets including real surveillance and low-resolution subsets of large-scale datasets, present a baseline result for several deep learning based approaches, and improve them by introducing a GAN pre-training approach and fully convolutional architecture; and {\em (iii)} we explore low-resolution face identification by employing a state-of-the-art supervised discriminative learning approach. Evaluations are conducted on challenging portions of the SCFace and UCCSface datasets. 
### 594.Adversarial Regularizers in Inverse Problems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11572.pdf)
> Inverse Problems in medical imaging and computer vision are traditionally solved using purely model-based methods. Among those variational regularization models are one of the most popular approaches. We propose a new framework for applying data-driven approaches to inverse problems, using a neural network as a regularization functional. The network learns to discriminate between the distribution of ground truth images and the distribution of unregularized reconstructions. Once trained, the network is applied to the inverse problem by solving the corresponding variational problem. Unlike other data-based approaches for inverse problems, the algorithm can be applied even if only unsupervised training data is available. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework for denoising on the BSDS dataset and for computer tomography reconstruction on the LIDC dataset. 
### 595.Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall, Who&#x27;s Got the Clearest Image of Them All? -  A Tailored Approach to Single Image Reflection Removal [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11589.pdf)
> Removing reflection artefacts from a single-image is a problem of both theoretical and practical interest. Removing these artefacts still presents challenges because of the massively ill-posed nature of reflection suppression. In this work, we propose a technique based on a novel optimisation problem. Firstly, we introduce an $H^2$ fidelity term, which preserves fine detail while enforcing global colour similarity. Secondly, we introduce a spatially dependent gradient sparsity prior, which allows user guidance to prevent information loss in reflection-free areas. We show that this combination allows us to mitigate some major drawbacks of the existing methods for reflection removal. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual experiments, that our method is able to outperform the state-of-the-art methods and compete against a recent deep learning approach. 
### 596.AdapterNet - learning input transformation for domain adaptation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11601.pdf)
> Deep neural networks have demonstrated impressive performance in various machine learning tasks. However, they are notoriously sensitive to changes in data distribution. Often, even a slight change in the distribution can lead to drastic performance reduction. Artificially augmenting the data may help to some extent, but in most cases, fails to achieve model invariance to the data distribution. Some examples where this sub-class of domain adaptation can be valuable are various imaging modalities such as thermal imaging, X-ray, ultrasound, and MRI, where changes in acquisition parameters or acquisition device manufacturer will result in different representation of the same input. Our work shows that standard finetuning fails to adapt the model in certain important cases. We propose a novel method of adapting to a new data source, and demonstrate near perfect adaptation on a customized ImageNet benchmark. 
### 597.Deep Video Portraits [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11714.pdf)
> We present a novel approach that enables photo-realistic re-animation of portrait videos using only an input video. In contrast to existing approaches that are restricted to manipulations of facial expressions only, we are the first to transfer the full 3D head position, head rotation, face expression, eye gaze, and eye blinking from a source actor to a portrait video of a target actor. The core of our approach is a generative neural network with a novel space-time architecture. The network takes as input synthetic renderings of a parametric face model, based on which it predicts photo-realistic video frames for a given target actor. The realism in this rendering-to-video transfer is achieved by careful adversarial training, and as a result, we can create modified target videos that mimic the behavior of the synthetically-created input. In order to enable source-to-target video re-animation, we render a synthetic target video with the reconstructed head animation parameters from a source video, and feed it into the trained network -- thus taking full control of the target. With the ability to freely recombine source and target parameters, we are able to demonstrate a large variety of video rewrite applications without explicitly modeling hair, body or background. For instance, we can reenact the full head using interactive user-controlled editing, and realize high-fidelity visual dubbing. To demonstrate the high quality of our output, we conduct an extensive series of experiments and evaluations, where for instance a user study shows that our video edits are hard to detect. 
### 598.Deep Mesh Projectors for Inverse Problems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11718.pdf)
> We develop a new learning-based approach to ill-posed inverse problems. Instead of directly learning the complex mapping from the measured data to the reconstruction, we learn an ensemble of simpler mappings from data to projections of the unknown model into random low-dimensional subspaces. We form the reconstruction by combining the estimated subspace projections. Structured subspaces of piecewise-constant images on random Delaunay triangulations allow us to address inverse problems with extremely sparse data and still get good reconstructions of the unknown geometry. This choice also makes our method robust against arbitrary data corruptions not seen during training. Further, it marginalizes the role of the training dataset which is essential for applications in geophysics where ground-truth datasets are exceptionally scarce. 
### 599.Rethinking Knowledge Graph Propagation for Zero-Shot Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11724.pdf)
> The potential of graph convolutional neural networks for the task of zero-shot learning has been demonstrated recently. These models are highly sample efficient as related concepts in the graph structure share statistical strength allowing generalization to new classes when faced with a lack of data. However, knowledge from distant nodes can get diluted when propagating through intermediate nodes, because current approaches to zero-shot learning use graph propagation schemes that perform Laplacian smoothing at each layer. We show that extensive smoothing does not help the task of regressing classifier weights in zero-shot learning. In order to still incorporate information from distant nodes and utilize the graph structure, we propose an Attentive Dense Graph Propagation Module (ADGPM). ADGPM allows us to exploit the hierarchical graph structure of the knowledge graph through additional connections. These connections are added based on a node's relationship to its ancestors and descendants and an attention scheme is further used to weigh their contribution depending on the distance to the node. Finally, we illustrate that finetuning of the feature representation after training the ADGPM leads to considerable improvements. Our method achieves competitive results, outperforming previous zero-shot learning approaches. 
### 600.HeadOn: Real-time Reenactment of Human Portrait Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11729.pdf)
> We propose HeadOn, the first real-time source-to-target reenactment approach for complete human portrait videos that enables transfer of torso and head motion, face expression, and eye gaze. Given a short RGB-D video of the target actor, we automatically construct a personalized geometry proxy that embeds a parametric head, eye, and kinematic torso model. A novel real-time reenactment algorithm employs this proxy to photo-realistically map the captured motion from the source actor to the target actor. On top of the coarse geometric proxy, we propose a video-based rendering technique that composites the modified target portrait video via view- and pose-dependent texturing, and creates photo-realistic imagery of the target actor under novel torso and head poses, facial expressions, and gaze directions. To this end, we propose a robust tracking of the face and torso of the source actor. We extensively evaluate our approach and show significant improvements in enabling much greater flexibility in creating realistic reenacted output videos. 
### 601.Superpixel-enhanced Pairwise Conditional Random Field for Semantic  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11737.pdf)
> Superpixel-based Higher-order Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are effective in enforcing long-range consistency in pixel-wise labeling problems, such as semantic segmentation. However, their major short coming is considerably longer time to learn higher-order potentials and extra hyperparameters and/or weights compared with pairwise models. This paper proposes a superpixel-enhanced pairwise CRF framework that consists of the conventional pairwise as well as our proposed superpixel-enhanced pairwise (SP-Pairwise) potentials. SP-Pairwise potentials incorporate the superpixel-based higher-order cues by conditioning on a segment filtered image and share the same set of parameters as the conventional pairwise potentials. Therefore, the proposed superpixel-enhanced pairwise CRF has a lower time complexity in parameter learning and at the same time it outperforms higher-order CRF in terms of inference accuracy. Moreover, the new scheme takes advantage of the pre-trained pairwise models by reusing their parameters and/or weights, which provides a significant accuracy boost on the basis of CRF-RNN even without training. Experiments on MSRC-21 and PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset confirm the effectiveness of our method. 
### 602.Semantic Road Layout Understanding by Generative Adversarial Inpainting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11746.pdf)
> Autonomous driving is becoming a reality, yet vehicles still need to rely on complex sensor fusion techniques to fully understand the scene they act in. Being able to discern the static environment from the dynamic entities that populate it, will improve scene comprehension algorithms and will pose constraints to the reasoning process about moving objects. With this in mind, we propose a scene comprehension task aimed at providing a complete understanding of the static surroundings, with a particular attention to road layout. In order to cut to the bare minimum the sensor requirements to be deployed on-board, we solely rely on semantic segmentation masks, which can be reliably obtained with computer vision algorithms from any RGB source. We cast this problem as an inpainting task based on a Generative Adversarial Network model to remove all dynamic objects from the scene and focus on understanding its static components such as streets, sidewalks and buildings. We evaluate this task on a synthetically generated dataset obtained with the CARLA simulator, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. 
### 603.AutoZOOM: Autoencoder-based Zeroth Order Optimization Method for  Attacking Black-box Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11770.pdf)
> Recent studies have shown that adversarial examples in state-of-the-art image classifiers trained by deep neural networks (DNN) can be easily generated when the target model is transparent to an attacker, known as the white-box setting. However, when attacking a deployed machine learning service, one can only acquire the input-output correspondences of the target model; this is the so-called black-box attack setting. The major drawback of existing black-box attacks is the need for excessive model queries, which may give a false sense of model robustness due to inefficient query designs. To bridge this gap, we propose a generic framework for query-efficient black-box attacks. Our framework, AutoZOOM, which is short for Autoencoder-based Zeroth Order Optimization Method, has two novel building blocks towards efficient black-box attacks: (i) an adaptive random gradient estimation strategy to balance query counts and distortion, and (ii) an autoencoder that is either trained offline with unlabeled data or a bilinear resizing operation for attack acceleration. Experimental results suggest that, by applying AutoZOOM to a state-of-the-art black-box attack (ZOO), a significant reduction in model queries can be achieved without sacrificing the attack success rate and the visual quality of the resulting adversarial examples. In particular, when compared to the standard ZOO method, AutoZOOM can consistently reduce the mean query counts in finding successful adversarial examples (or reaching the same distortion level) by at least 93% on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, leading to novel insights on adversarial robustness. 
### 604.Object Detection using Domain Randomization and Generative Adversarial  Refinement of Synthetic Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11778.pdf)
> In this work, we present an application of domain randomization and generative adversarial networks (GAN) to train a near real-time object detector for industrial electric parts, entirely in a simulated environment. Large scale availability of labelled real world data is typically rare and difficult to obtain in many industrial settings. As such here, only a few hundred of unlabelled real images are used to train a Cyclic-GAN network, in combination with various degree of domain randomization procedures. We demonstrate that this enables robust translation of synthetic images to the real world domain. We show that a combination of the original synthetic (simulation) and GAN translated images, when used for training a Mask-RCNN object detection network achieves greater than 0.95 mean average precision in detecting and classifying a collection of industrial electric parts. We evaluate the performance across different combinations of training data. 
### 605.Hyperspectral Imaging Technology and Transfer Learning Utilized in  Identification Haploid Maize Seeds [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11784.pdf)
> It is extremely important to correctly identify the cultivars of maize seeds in the breeding process of maize. In this paper, the transfer learning as a method of deep learning is adopted to establish a model by combining with the hyperspectral imaging technology. The haploid seeds can be recognized from large amount of diploid maize ones with great accuracy through the model. First, the information of maize seeds on each wave band is collected using the hyperspectral imaging technology, and then the recognition model is built on VGG-19 network, which is pre-trained by large-scale computer vision database (Image-Net). The correct identification rate of model utilizing seed spectral images containing 256 wave bands (862.5-1704.2nm) reaches 96.32%, and the correct identification rate of the model utilizing the seed spectral images containing single-band reaches 95.75%. The experimental results show that, CNN model which is pre-trained by visible light image database can be applied to the near-infrared hyperspectral imaging-based identification of maize seeds, and high accurate identification rate can be achieved. Meanwhile, when there is small amount of data samples, it can still realize high recognition by using transfer learning. The model not only meets the requirements of breeding recognition, but also greatly reduce the cost occurred in sample collection. 
### 606.Multi-function Convolutional Neural Networks for Improving Image  Classification Performance [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11788.pdf)
> Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) typically use the same activation function (usually ReLU) for all neurons with non-linear mapping operations. For example, the deep convolutional architecture Inception-v4 uses ReLU. To improve the classification performance of traditional CNNs, a new "Multi-function Convolutional Neural Network" (MCNN) is created by using different activation functions for different neurons. For $n$ neurons and $m$ different activation functions, there are a total of $m^n-m$ MCNNs and only $m$ traditional CNNs. Therefore, the best model is very likely to be chosen from MCNNs because there are $m^n-2m$ more MCNNs than traditional CNNs. For performance analysis, two different datasets for two applications (classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST database and classifying brain MRI images into one of the four stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD)) are used. For both applications, an activation function is randomly selected for each layer of a MCNN. For the AD diagnosis application, MCNNs using a newly created multi-function Inception-v4 architecture are constructed. Overall, simulations show that MCNNs can outperform traditional CNNs in terms of multi-class classification accuracy for both applications. An important future research work will be to efficiently select the best MCNN from $m^n-m$ candidate MCNNs. Current CNN software only provides users with partial functionality of MCNNs since different layers can use different activation functions but not individual neurons in the same layer. Thus, modifying current CNN software systems such as ResNets, DenseNets, and Dual Path Networks by using multiple activation functions and developing more effective and faster MCNN software systems and tools would be very useful to solve difficult practical image classification problems. 
### 607.A Fine-to-Coarse Convolutional Neural Network for 3D Human Action  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11790.pdf)
> This paper presents a new framework for human action recognition from a 3D skeleton sequence. Previous studies do not fully utilize the temporal relationships between video segments in a human action. Some studies successfully used very deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models but often suffer from the data insufficiency problem. In this study, we first segment a skeleton sequence into distinct temporal segments in order to exploit the correlations between them. The temporal and spatial features of a skeleton sequence are then extracted simultaneously by utilizing a fine-to-coarse (F2C) CNN architecture optimized for human skeleton sequences. We evaluate our proposed method on NTU RGB+D and SBU Kinect Interaction dataset. It achieves 79.6% and 84.6% of accuracies on NTU RGB+D with cross-object and cross-view protocol, respectively, which are almost identical with the state-of-the-art performance. In addition, our method significantly improves the accuracy of the actions in two-person interactions. 
### 608.CRRN: Multi-Scale Guided Concurrent Reflection Removal Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11802.pdf)
> Removing the undesired reflections from images taken through the glass is of broad application to various computer vision tasks. Non-learning based methods utilize different handcrafted priors such as the separable sparse gradients caused by different levels of blurs, which often fail due to their limited description capability to the properties of real-world reflections. In this paper, we propose the Concurrent Reflection Removal Network (CRRN) to tackle this problem in a unified framework. Our proposed network integrates image appearance information and multi-scale gradient information with human perception inspired loss function, and is trained on a new dataset with 3250 reflection images taken under diverse real-world scenes. Extensive experiments on a public benchmark dataset show that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. 
### 609.Enabling Pedestrian Safety using Computer Vision Techniques: A Case  Study of the 2018 Uber Inc. Self-driving Car Crash [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11815.pdf)
> Human lives are important. The decision to allow self-driving vehicles operate on our roads carries great weight. This has been a hot topic of debate between policy-makers, technologists and public safety institutions. The recent Uber Inc. self-driving car crash, resulting in the death of a pedestrian, has strengthened the argument that autonomous vehicle technology is still not ready for deployment on public roads. In this work, we analyze the Uber car crash and shed light on the question, "Could the Uber Car Crash have been avoided?". We apply state-of-the-art Computer Vision models to this highly practical scenario. More generally, our experimental results are an evaluation of various image enhancement and object recognition techniques for enabling pedestrian safety in low-lighting conditions using the Uber crash as a case study. 
### 610.Learning multiple non-mutually-exclusive tasks for improved  classification of inherently ordered labels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11837.pdf)
> Medical image classification involves thresholding of labels that represent malignancy risk levels. Usually, a task defines a single threshold, and when developing computer-aided diagnosis tools, a single network is trained per such threshold, e.g. as screening out healthy (very low risk) patients to leave possibly sick ones for further analysis (low threshold), or trying to find malignant cases among those marked as non-risk by the radiologist ("second reading", high threshold). We propose a way to rephrase the classification problem in a manner that yields several problems (corresponding to different thresholds) to be solved simultaneously. This allows the use of Multiple Task Learning (MTL) methods, significantly improving the performance of the original classifier, by facilitating effective extraction of information from existing data. 
### 611.Neural Joking Machine : Humorous image captioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11850.pdf)
> What is an effective expression that draws laughter from human beings? In the present paper, in order to consider this question from an academic standpoint, we generate an image caption that draws a "laugh" by a computer. A system that outputs funny captions based on the image caption proposed in the computer vision field is constructed. Moreover, we also propose the Funny Score, which flexibly gives weights according to an evaluation database. The Funny Score more effectively brings out "laughter" to optimize a model. In addition, we build a self-collected BoketeDB, which contains a theme (image) and funny caption (text) posted on "Bokete", which is an image Ogiri website. In an experiment, we use BoketeDB to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the results obtained using the proposed method and those obtained using MS COCO Pre-trained CNN+LSTM, which is the baseline and idiot created by humans. We refer to the proposed method, which uses the BoketeDB pre-trained model, as the Neural Joking Machine (NJM). 
### 612.RUN:Residual U-Net for Computer-Aided Detection of Pulmonary Nodules  without Candidate Selection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11856.pdf)
> The early detection and early diagnosis of lung cancer are crucial to improve the survival rate of lung cancer patients. Pulmonary nodules detection results have a significant impact on the later diagnosis. In this work, we propose a new network named RUN to complete nodule detection in a single step by bypassing the candidate selection. The system introduces the shortcut of the residual network to improve the traditional U-Net, thereby solving the disadvantage of poor results due to its lack of depth. Furthermore, we compare the experimental results with the traditional U-Net. We validate our method in LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) Nodule Detection Challenge. We acquire a sensitivity of 90.90% at 2 false positives per scan and therefore achieve better performance than the current state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 613.Needle Tip Force Estimation using an OCT Fiber and a Fused convGRU-CNN  Architecture [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11911.pdf)
> Needle insertion is common during minimally invasive interventions such as biopsy or brachytherapy. During soft tissue needle insertion, forces acting at the needle tip cause tissue deformation and needle deflection. Accurate needle tip force measurement provides information on needle-tissue interaction and helps detecting and compensating potential misplacement. For this purpose we introduce an image-based needle tip force estimation method using an optical fiber imaging the deformation of an epoxy layer below the needle tip over time. For calibration and force estimation, we introduce a novel deep learning-based fused convolutional GRU-CNN model which effectively exploits the spatio-temporal data structure. The needle is easy to manufacture and our model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.76 +- 1.5 mN with a cross-correlation coefficient of 0.9996, clearly outperforming other methods. We test needles with different materials to demonstrate that the approach can be adapted for different sensitivities and force ranges. Furthermore, we validate our approach in an ex-vivo prostate needle insertion scenario. 
### 614.Propagating Confidences through CNNs for Sparse Data Regression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11913.pdf)
> In most computer vision applications, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) operate on dense image data generated by ordinary cameras. Designing CNNs for sparse and irregularly spaced input data is still an open problem with numerous applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance. To tackle this challenging problem, we introduce an algebraically-constrained convolution layer for CNNs with sparse input and demonstrate its capabilities for the scene depth completion task. We propose novel strategies for determining the confidence from the convolution operation and propagating it to consecutive layers. Furthermore, we propose an objective function that simultaneously minimizes the data error while maximizing the output confidence. Comprehensive experiments are performed on the KITTI depth benchmark and the results clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance while requiring three times fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our approach produces a continuous pixel-wise confidence map enabling information fusion, state inference, and decision support. 
### 615.Multiple Manifolds Metric Learning with Application to Image Set  Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11918.pdf)
> In image set classification, a considerable advance has been made by modeling the original image sets by second order statistics or linear subspace, which typically lie on the Riemannian manifold. Specifically, they are Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold and Grassmann manifold respectively, and some algorithms have been developed on them for classification tasks. Motivated by the inability of existing methods to extract discriminatory features for data on Riemannian manifolds, we propose a novel algorithm which combines multiple manifolds as the features of the original image sets. In order to fuse these manifolds, the well-studied Riemannian kernels have been utilized to map the original Riemannian spaces into high dimensional Hilbert spaces. A metric Learning method has been devised to embed these kernel spaces into a lower dimensional common subspace for classification. The state-of-the-art results achieved on three datasets corresponding to two different classification tasks, namely face recognition and object categorization, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
### 616.Learning to Generate Facial Depth Maps [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11927.pdf)
> In this paper, an adversarial architecture for facial depth map estimation from monocular intensity images is presented. By following an image-to-image approach, we combine the advantages of supervised learning and adversarial training, proposing a conditional Generative Adversarial Network that effectively learns to translate intensity face images into the corresponding depth maps. Two public datasets, namely Biwi database and Pandora dataset, are exploited to demonstrate that the proposed model generates high-quality synthetic depth images, both in terms of visual appearance and informative content. Furthermore, we show that the model is capable of predicting distinctive facial details by testing the generated depth maps through a deep model trained on authentic depth maps for the face verification task. 
### 617.Automatic Large-Scale Data Acquisition via Crowdsourcing for Crosswalk  Classification: A Deep Learning Approach [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11970.pdf)
> Correctly identifying crosswalks is an essential task for the driving activity and mobility autonomy. Many crosswalk classification, detection and localization systems have been proposed in the literature over the years. These systems use different perspectives to tackle the crosswalk classification problem: satellite imagery, cockpit view (from the top of a car or behind the windshield), and pedestrian perspective. Most of the works in the literature are designed and evaluated using small and local datasets, i.e. datasets that present low diversity. Scaling to large datasets imposes a challenge for the annotation procedure. Moreover, there is still need for cross-database experiments in the literature because it is usually hard to collect the data in the same place and conditions of the final application. In this paper, we present a crosswalk classification system based on deep learning. For that, crowdsourcing platforms, such as OpenStreetMap and Google Street View, are exploited to enable automatic training via automatic acquisition and annotation of a large-scale database. Additionally, this work proposes a comparison study of models trained using fully-automatic data acquisition and annotation against models that were partially annotated. Cross-database experiments were also included in the experimentation to show that the proposed methods enable use with real world applications. Our results show that the model trained on the fully-automatic database achieved high overall accuracy (94.12%), and that a statistically significant improvement (to 96.30%) can be achieved by manually annotating a specific part of the database. Finally, the results of the cross-database experiments show that both models are robust to the many variations of image and scenarios, presenting a consistent behavior. 
### 618.Generalizing to Unseen Domains via Adversarial Data Augmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12018.pdf)
> We are concerned with learning models that generalize well to different unseen domains. We consider a worst-case formulation over data distributions that are near the source domain in the feature space. Only using training data from the source domain, we propose an iterative procedure that augments the dataset with examples from a fictitious target domain that is "hard" under the current model. We show that our iterative scheme is an adaptive data augmentation method where we append adversarial examples at each iteration. For softmax losses, we show that our method is a data-dependent regularization scheme that behaves differently from classical regularizers (e.g., ridge or lasso) that regularize towards zero. On digit recognition and semantic segmentation tasks, we empirically observe that our method learns models that improve performance across a priori unknown data distributions 
### 619.Stochastic Deep Compressive Sensing for the Reconstruction of Diffusion  Tensor Cardiac MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12064.pdf)
> Understanding the structure of the heart at the microscopic scale of cardiomyocytes and their aggregates provides new insights into the mechanisms of heart disease and enables the investigation of effective therapeutics. Diffusion Tensor Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (DT-CMR) is a unique non-invasive technique that can resolve the microscopic structure, organisation, and integrity of the myocardium without the need for exogenous contrast agents. However, this technique suffers from relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and frequent signal loss due to respiratory and cardiac motion. Current DT-CMR techniques rely on acquiring and averaging multiple signal acquisitions to improve the SNR. Moreover, in order to mitigate the influence of respiratory movement, patients are required to perform many breath holds which results in prolonged acquisition durations (e.g., ~30 mins using the existing technology). In this study, we propose a novel cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based compressive sensing (CS) technique and explore its applicability to improve DT-CMR acquisitions. Our simulation based studies have achieved high reconstruction fidelity and good agreement between DT-CMR parameters obtained with the proposed reconstruction and fully sampled ground truth. When compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our proposed deep cascaded CNN method and its stochastic variation demonstrated significant improvements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using deep CNN based CS for the DT-CMR reconstruction. In addition, with relatively straightforward modifications to the acquisition scheme, our method can easily be translated into a method for online, at-the-scanner reconstruction enabling the deployment of accelerated DT-CMR in various clinical applications. 
### 620.A Robust and Effective Approach Towards Accurate Metastasis Detection  and pN-stage Classification in Breast Cancer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12067.pdf)
> Predicting TNM stage is the major determinant of breast cancer prognosis and treatment. The essential part of TNM stage classification is whether the cancer has metastasized to the regional lymph nodes (N-stage). Pathologic N-stage (pN-stage) is commonly performed by pathologists detecting metastasis in histological slides. However, this diagnostic procedure is prone to misinterpretation and would normally require extensive time by pathologists because of the sheer volume of data that needs a thorough review. Automated detection of lymph node metastasis and pN-stage prediction has a great potential to reduce their workload and help the pathologist. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown significant improvements in histological slide analysis, but accuracy is not optimized because of the difficulty in the handling of gigapixel images. In this paper, we propose a robust method for metastasis detection and pN-stage classification in breast cancer from multiple gigapixel pathology images in an effective way. pN-stage is predicted by combining patch-level CNN based metastasis detector and slide-level lymph node classifier. The proposed framework achieves a state-of-the-art quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.9203 on the Camelyon17 dataset, outperforming the previous winning method of the Camelyon17 challenge. 
### 621.Automatic, fast and robust characterization of noise distributions for  diffusion MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12071.pdf)
> Knowledge of the noise distribution in magnitude diffusion MRI images is the centerpiece to quantify uncertainties arising from the acquisition process. The use of parallel imaging methods, the number of receiver coils and imaging filters applied by the scanner, amongst other factors, dictate the resulting signal distribution. Accurate estimation beyond textbook Rician or noncentral chi distributions often requires information about the acquisition process (e.g. coils sensitivity maps or reconstruction coefficients), which is not usually available. We introduce a new method where a change of variable naturally gives rise to a particular form of the gamma distribution for background signals. The first moments and maximum likelihood estimators of this gamma distribution explicitly depend on the number of coils, making it possible to estimate all unknown parameters using only the magnitude data. A rejection step is used to make the method automatic and robust to artifacts. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that the proposed method can reliably estimate both the degrees of freedom and the standard deviation. The worst case errors range from below 2% (spatially uniform noise) to approximately 10% (spatially variable noise). Repeated acquisitions of in vivo datasets show that the estimated parameters are stable and have lower variances than compared methods. 
### 622.CuisineNet: Food Attributes Classification using Multi-scale Convolution  Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12081.pdf)
> Diversity of food and its attributes represents the culinary habits of peoples from different countries. Thus, this paper addresses the problem of identifying food culture of people around the world and its flavor by classifying two main food attributes, cuisine and flavor. A deep learning model based on multi-scale convotuional networks is proposed for extracting more accurate features from input images. The aggregation of multi-scale convolution layers with different kernel size is also used for weighting the features results from different scales. In addition, a joint loss function based on Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) is used to fit the model probability to multi labeled classes for multi-modal classification task. Furthermore, this work provides a new dataset for food attributes, so-called Yummly48K, extracted from the popular food website, Yummly. Our model is assessed on the constructed Yummly48K dataset. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields 65% and 62% average F1 score on validation and test set which outperforming the state-of-the-art models. 
### 623.Context-aware Cascade Attention-based RNN for Video Emotion Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12098.pdf)
> Emotion recognition can provide crucial information about the user in many applications when building human-computer interaction (HCI) systems. Most of current researches on visual emotion recognition are focusing on exploring facial features. However, context information including surrounding environment and human body can also provide extra clues to recognize emotion more accurately. Inspired by "sequence to sequence model" for neural machine translation, which models input and output sequences by an encoder and a decoder in recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture respectively, a novel architecture, "CACA-RNN", is proposed in this work. The proposed network consists of two RNNs in a cascaded architecture to process both context and facial information to perform video emotion classification. Results of the model were submitted to video emotion recognition sub-challenge in Multimodal Emotion Recognition Challenge (MEC2017). CACA-RNN outperforms the MEC2017 baseline (mAP of 21.7%): it achieved mAP of 45.51% on the testing set in the video only challenge. 
### 624.Supervised Mixed Norm Autoencoder for Kinship Verification in  Unconstrained Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12167.pdf)
> Identifying kinship relations has garnered interest due to several applications such as organizing and tagging the enormous amount of videos being uploaded on the Internet. Existing research in kinship verification primarily focuses on kinship prediction with image pairs. In this research, we propose a new deep learning framework for kinship verification in unconstrained videos using a novel Supervised Mixed Norm regularization Autoencoder (SMNAE). This new autoencoder formulation introduces class-specific sparsity in the weight matrix. The proposed three-stage SMNAE based kinship verification framework utilizes the learned spatio-temporal representation in the video frames for verifying kinship in a pair of videos. A new kinship video (KIVI) database of more than 500 individuals with variations due to illumination, pose, occlusion, ethnicity, and expression is collected for this research. It comprises a total of 355 true kin video pairs with over 250,000 still frames. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the KIVI database and six existing kinship databases. On the KIVI database, SMNAE yields video-based kinship verification accuracy of 83.18% which is at least 3.2% better than existing algorithms. The algorithm is also evaluated on six publicly available kinship databases and compared with best-reported results. It is observed that the proposed SMNAE consistently yields best results on all the databases 
### 625.Learning Video Summarization Using Unpaired Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12174.pdf)
> We consider the problem of video summarization. Given an input raw video, the goal is to select a small subset of key frames from the input video to create a shorter summary video that best describes the content of the original video. Most of the current state-of-the-art video summarization approaches use supervised learning and require training data in the form of paired videos. Each pair consists of a raw input video and a ground-truth summary video curated by human annotators. However, it is difficult to create such paired training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel formulation to learn video summarization from unpaired data. Our method only requires training data in the form of two sets of videos: a set of raw videos ($V$) and another set of summary videos ($S$). We do not require the correspondence between these two sets of videos. We argue that this type of data is much easier to collect. We present an approach that learns to generate summary videos from such unpaired data. We achieve this by learning a mapping function $F : V \rightarrow S $ which tries to make the distribution of generated summary videos from $F(V)$ similar to the distribution of $S$ while enforcing a high visual diversity constraint on $F(V)$. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms other alternative methods. 
### 626.Why do deep convolutional networks generalize so poorly to small image  transformations? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12177.pdf)
> Deep convolutional network architectures are often assumed to guarantee generalization for small image translations and deformations. In this paper we show that modern CNNs (VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2) can drastically change their output when an image is translated in the image plane by a few pixels, and that this failure of generalization also happens with other realistic small image transformations. Furthermore, the deeper the network the more we see these failures to generalize. We show that these failures are related to the fact that the architecture of modern CNNs ignores the classical sampling theorem so that generalization is not guaranteed. We also show that biases in the statistics of commonly used image datasets makes it unlikely that CNNs will learn to be invariant to these transformations. Taken together our results suggest that the performance of CNNs in object recognition falls far short of the generalization capabilities of humans. 
### 627.Dense labeling of large remote sensing imagery with convolutional neural  networks: a simple and faster alternative to stitching output label maps [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12219.pdf)
> In this work we consider the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pixel-wise labeling (a.k.a., semantic segmentation) of remote sensing imagery (e.g., aerial color or hyperspectral imagery). Remote sensing imagery is usually stored in the form of very large images, referred to as "tiles", which are too large to be segmented directly using most CNNs and their associated hardware. As a result, during label inference, smaller sub-images, called "patches", are processed individually and then "stitched" (concatenated) back together to create a tile-sized label map. This approach suffers from computational ineffiency and can result in discontinuities at output boundaries. We propose a simple alternative approach in which the input size of the CNN is dramatically increased only during label inference. This does not avoid stitching altogether, but substantially mitigates its limitations. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against a vonventional stitching approach using two popular segmentation CNN models and two large-scale remote sensing imagery datasets. The results suggest that the proposed approach substantially reduces label inference time, while also yielding modest overall label accuracy increases. This approach contributed to our wining entry (overall performance) in the INRIA building labeling competition. 
### 628.Collaborative Human-AI (CHAI): Evidence-Based Interpretable Melanoma  Classification in Dermoscopic Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12234.pdf)
> Automated dermoscopic image analysis has witnessed rapid growth in diagnostic performance. Yet adoption faces resistance, in part, because no evidence is provided to support decisions. In this work, an approach for evidence-based classification is presented. A feature embedding is learned with CNNs, triplet-loss, and global average pooling, and used to classify via kNN search. Evidence is provided as both the discovered neighbors, as well as localized image regions most relevant to measuring distance between query and neighbors. To ensure that results are relevant in terms of both label accuracy and human visual similarity for any skill level, a novel hierarchical triplet logic is implemented to jointly learn an embedding according to disease labels and non-expert similarity. Results are improved over baselines trained on disease labels alone, as well as standard multiclass loss. Quantitative relevance of results, according to non-expert similarity, as well as localized image regions, are also significantly improved. 
### 629.Novel Video Prediction for Large-scale Scene using Optical Flow [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12243.pdf)
> Making predictions of future frames is a critical challenge in autonomous driving research. Most of the existing methods for video prediction attempt to generate future frames in simple and fixed scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective optical flow conditioned method for the task of video prediction with an application to complex urban scenes. In contrast with previous work, the prediction model only requires video sequences and optical flow sequences for training and testing. Our method uses the rich spatial-temporal features in video sequences. The method takes advantage of the motion information extracting from optical flow maps between neighbor images as well as previous images. Empirical evaluations on the KITTI dataset and the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 
### 630.Multi-Resolution 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12254.pdf)
> Learning from 3D Data is a fascinating idea which is well explored and studied in computer vision. This allows one to learn from very sparse LiDAR data, point cloud data as well as 3D objects in terms of CAD models and surfaces etc. Most of the approaches to learn from such data are limited to uniform 3D volume occupancy grids or octree representations. A major challenge in learning from 3D data is that one needs to define a proper resolution to represent it in a voxel grid and this becomes a bottleneck for the learning algorithms. Specifically, while we focus on learning from 3D data, a fine resolution is very important to capture key features in the object and at the same time the data becomes sparser as the resolution becomes finer. There are numerous applications in computer vision where a multi-resolution representation is used instead of a uniform grid representation in order to make the applications memory efficient. Though such methods are difficult to learn from, they are much more efficient in representing 3D data. In this paper, we explore the challenges in learning from such data representation. In particular, we use a multi-level voxel representation where we define a coarse voxel grid that contains information of important voxels(boundary voxels) and multiple fine voxel grids corresponding to each significant voxel of the coarse grid. A multi-level voxel representation can capture important features in the 3D data in a memory efficient way in comparison to an octree representation. Consequently, learning from a 3D object with high resolution, which is paramount in feature recognition, is made efficient. 
### 631.Rehabilitating the ColorChecker Dataset for Illuminant Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12262.pdf)
> In a previous work, it was shown that there is a curious problem with the benchmark ColorChecker dataset for illuminant estimation. To wit, this dataset has at least 3 different sets of ground-truths. Typically, for a single algorithm a single ground-truth is used. But then different algorithms, whose performance is measured with respect to different ground-truths, are compared against each other and then ranked. This makes no sense. We show in this paper that there are also errors in how each ground-truth set was calculated. As a result, all performance rankings based on the ColorChecker dataset - and there are scores of these - are inaccurate. <br />In this paper, we re-generate a new 'recommended' set of ground-truth based on the calculation methodology described by Shi and Funt. We then review the performance evaluation of a range of illuminant estimation algorithms. Compared with the legacy ground-truths, we find that the difference in how algorithms perform can be large, with many local rankings of algorithms being reversed. <br />Finally, we draw the readers attention to our new 'open' data repository which, we hope, will allow the ColorChecker set to be rehabilitated and once again to become a useful benchmark for illuminant estimation algorithms. 
### 632.Learning Factorized Representations for Open-set Domain Adaptation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12277.pdf)
> Domain adaptation for visual recognition has undergone great progress in the past few years. Nevertheless, most existing methods work in the so-called closed-set scenario, assuming that the classes depicted by the target images are exactly the same as those of the source domain. In this paper, we tackle the more challenging, yet more realistic case of open-set domain adaptation, where new, unknown classes can be present in the target data. While, in the unsupervised scenario, one cannot expect to be able to identify each specific new class, we aim to automatically detect which samples belong to these new classes and discard them from the recognition process. To this end, we rely on the intuition that the source and target samples depicting the known classes can be generated by a shared subspace, whereas the target samples from unknown classes come from a different, private subspace. We therefore introduce a framework that factorizes the data into shared and private parts, while encouraging the shared representation to be discriminative. Our experiments on standard benchmarks evidence that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in open-set domain adaptation. 
### 633.Bayesian Pose Graph Optimization via Bingham Distributions and Tempered  Geodesic MCMC [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12279.pdf)
> We introduce Tempered Geodesic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TG-MCMC) algorithm for initializing pose graph optimization problems, arising in various scenarios such as SFM (structure from motion) or SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). TG-MCMC is first of its kind as it unites asymptotically global non-convex optimization on the spherical manifold of quaternions with posterior sampling, in order to provide both reliable initial poses and uncertainty estimates that are informative about the quality of individual solutions. We devise rigorous theoretical convergence guarantees for our method and extensively evaluate it on synthetic and real benchmark datasets. Besides its elegance in formulation and theory, we show that our method is robust to missing data, noise and the estimated uncertainties capture intuitive properties of the data. 
### 634.Efficient Traffic-Sign Recognition with Scale-aware CNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12289.pdf)
> The paper presents a Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) system, which can fast and accurately recognize traffic signs of different sizes in images. The system consists of two well-designed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), one for region proposals of traffic signs and one for classification of each region. In the proposal CNN, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with a dual multi-scale architecture is proposed to achieve scale invariant detection. In training the proposal network, a modified "Online Hard Example Mining" (OHEM) scheme is adopted to suppress false positives. The classification network fuses multi-scale features as representation and adopts an "Inception" module for efficiency. We evaluate the proposed TSR system and its components with extensive experiments. Our method obtains $99.88\%$ precision and $96.61\%$ recall on the Swedish Traffic Signs Dataset (STSD), higher than state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our system is faster and more lightweight than state-of-the-art deep learning networks for traffic sign recognition. 
### 635.Image-Dependent Local Entropy Models for Learned Image Compression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12295.pdf)
> The leading approach for image compression with artificial neural networks (ANNs) is to learn a nonlinear transform and a fixed entropy model that are optimized for rate-distortion performance. We show that this approach can be significantly improved by incorporating spatially local, image-dependent entropy models. The key insight is that existing ANN-based methods learn an entropy model that is shared between the encoder and decoder, but they do not transmit any side information that would allow the model to adapt to the structure of a specific image. We present a method for augmenting ANN-based image coders with image-dependent side information that leads to a 17.8% rate reduction over a state-of-the-art ANN-based baseline model on a standard evaluation set, and 70-98% reductions on images with low visual complexity that are poorly captured by a fixed, global entropy model. 
### 636.Adversarial Attacks on Face Detectors using Neural Net based Constrained  Optimization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12302.pdf)
> Adversarial attacks involve adding, small, often imperceptible, perturbations to inputs with the goal of getting a machine learning model to misclassifying them. While many different adversarial attack strategies have been proposed on image classification models, object detection pipelines have been much harder to break. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to craft adversarial examples by solving a constrained optimization problem using an adversarial generator network. Our approach is fast and scalable, requiring only a forward pass through our trained generator network to craft an adversarial sample. Unlike in many attack strategies, we show that the same trained generator is capable of attacking new images without explicitly optimizing on them. We evaluate our attack on a trained Faster R-CNN face detector on the cropped 300-W face dataset where we manage to reduce the number of detected faces to $0.5\%$ of all originally detected faces. In a different experiment, also on 300-W, we demonstrate the robustness of our attack to a JPEG compression based defense typical JPEG compression level of $75\%$ reduces the effectiveness of our attack from only $0.5\%$ of detected faces to a modest $5.0\%$. 
### 637.DeepMiner: Discovering Interpretable Representations for Mammogram  Classification and Explanation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12323.pdf)
> We propose DeepMiner, a framework to discover interpretable representations in deep neural networks and to build explanations for medical predictions. By probing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to classify cancer in mammograms, we show that many individual units in the final convolutional layer of a CNN respond strongly to diseased tissue concepts specified by the BI-RADS lexicon. After expert annotation of the interpretable units, our proposed method is able to generate explanations for CNN mammogram classification that are correlated with ground truth radiology reports on the DDSM dataset. We show that DeepMiner not only enables better understanding of the nuances of CNN classification decisions, but also possibly discovers new visual knowledge relevant to medical diagnosis. 
### 638.Simultaneous Optical Flow and Segmentation (SOFAS) using Dynamic Vision  Sensor [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12326.pdf)
> We present an algorithm (SOFAS) to estimate the optical flow of events generated by a dynamic vision sensor (DVS). Where traditional cameras produce frames at a fixed rate, DVSs produce asynchronous events in response to intensity changes with a high temporal resolution. Our algorithm uses the fact that events are generated by edges in the scene to not only estimate the optical flow but also to simultaneously segment the image into objects which are travelling at the same velocity. This way it is able to avoid the aperture problem which affects other implementations such as Lucas-Kanade. Finally, we show that SOFAS produces more accurate results than traditional optic flow algorithms. 
### 639.Light Field Denoising via Anisotropic Parallax Analysis in a CNN  Framework [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12358.pdf)
> Light field (LF) cameras provide perspective information of scenes by taking directional measurements of the focusing light rays. The raw outputs are usually dark with additive camera noise, which impedes subsequent processing and applications. We propose a novel LF denoising framework based on anisotropic parallax analysis (APA). Two convolutional neural networks are jointly designed for the task: first, the structural parallax synthesis network predicts the parallax details for the entire LF based on a set of anisotropic parallax features. These novel features can efficiently capture the high frequency perspective components of a LF from noisy observations. Second, the view-dependent detail compensation network restores non-Lambertian variation to each LF view by involving view-specific spatial energies. Extensive experiments show that the proposed APA LF denoiser provides a much better denoising performance than state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and in preservation of parallax details. 
### 640.Lip Reading Using Convolutional Auto Encoders as Feature Extractor [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12371.pdf)
> Visual recognition of speech using the lip movement is called Lip-reading. Recent developments in this nascent field uses different neural networks as feature extractors which serve as input to a model which can map the temporal relationship and classify. Though end to end sentence level Lip-reading is the current trend, we proposed a new model which employs word level classification and breaks the set benchmarks for standard datasets. In our model we use convolutional autoencoders as feature extractors which are then fed to a Long short-term memory model. We tested our proposed model on BBC's LRW dataset, MIRACL-VC1 and GRID dataset. Achieving a classification accuracy of 98% on MIRACL-VC1 as compared to 93.4% of the set benchmark (Rekik et al., 2014). On BBC's LRW the proposed model performed better than the baseline model of convolutional neural networks and Long short-term memory model (Garg et al., 2016). Showing the features learned by the models we clearly indicate how the proposed model works better than the baseline model. The same model can also be extended for end to end sentence level classification. 
### 641.Deep Learning with unsupervised data labeling for weeds detection on UAV  images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12395.pdf)
> In modern agriculture, usually weeds control consists in spraying herbicides all over the agricultural field. This practice involves significant waste and cost of herbicide for farmers and environmental pollution. One way to reduce the cost and environmental impact is to allocate the right doses of herbicide at the right place and at the right time (Precision Agriculture). Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is becoming an interesting acquisition system for weeds localization and management due to its ability to obtain the images of the entire agricultural field with a very high spatial resolution and at low cost. Despite the important advances in UAV acquisition systems, automatic weeds detection remains a challenging problem because of its strong similarity with the crops. Recently Deep Learning approach has shown impressive results in different complex classification problem. However, this approach needs a certain amount of training data but, creating large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations by expert is an extremely time consuming task. In this paper, we propose a novel fully automatic learning method using Convolutional Neuronal Networks (CNNs) with unsupervised training dataset collection for weeds detection from UAV images. The proposed method consists in three main phases. First we automatically detect the crop lines and using them to identify the interline weeds. In the second phase, interline weeds are used to constitute the training dataset. Finally, we performed CNNs on this dataset to build a model able to detect the crop and weeds in the images. The results obtained are comparable to the traditional supervised training data labeling. The accuracy gaps are 1.5% in the spinach field and 6% in the bean field. 
### 642.One-shot domain adaptation in multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation  using convolutional neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12415.pdf)
> In recent years, several convolutional neural network (CNN) methods have been proposed for the automated white matter lesion segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) patient images, due to their superior performance compared with those of other state-of-the-art methods. However, the accuracies of CNN methods tend to decrease significantly when evaluated on different image domains compared with those used for training, which demonstrates the lack of adaptability of CNNs to unseen imaging data. In this study, we analyzed the effect of intensity domain adaptation on our recently proposed CNN-based MS lesion segmentation method. Given a source model trained on two public MS datasets, we investigated the transferability of the CNN model when applied to other MRI scanners and protocols, evaluating the minimum number of annotated images needed from the new domain and the minimum number of layers needed to re-train to obtain comparable accuracy. Our analysis comprised MS patient data from both a clinical center and the public ISBI2015 challenge database, which permitted us to compare the domain adaptation capability of our model to that of other state-of-the-art methods. For the ISBI2015 challenge, our one-shot domain adaptation model trained using only a single image showed a performance similar to that of other CNN methods that were fully trained using the entire available training set, yielding a comparable human expert rater performance. We believe that our experiments will encourage the MS community to incorporate its use in different clinical settings with reduced amounts of annotated data. This approach could be meaningful not only in terms of the accuracy in delineating MS lesions but also in the related reductions in time and economic costs derived from manual lesion labeling. 
### 643.New Feature Detection Mechanism for Extended Kalman Filter Based  Monocular SLAM with 1-Point RANSAC [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12443.pdf)
> We present a different approach of feature point detection for improving the accuracy of SLAM using single, monocular camera. Traditionally, Harris Corner detection, SURF or FAST corner detectors are used for finding feature points of interest in the image. We replace this with another approach, which involves building a non-linear scale-space representation of images using Perona and Malik Diffusion equation and computing the scale normalized Hessian at multiple scale levels (KAZE feature). The feature points so detected are used to estimate the state and pose of a mono camera using extended Kalman filter. By using accelerated KAZE features and a more rigorous feature rejection routine combined with 1-point RANSAC for outlier rejection, short baseline matching of features are significantly improved, even with a lesser number of feature points, especially in the presence of motion blur. We present a comparative study of our proposal with FAST and show improved localization accuracy in terms of absolute trajectory error. 
### 644.On GANs and GMMs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12462.pdf)
> A longstanding problem in machine learning is to find unsupervised methods that can learn the statistical structure of high dimensional signals. In recent years, GANs have gained much attention as a possible solution to the problem, and in particular have shown the ability to generate remarkably realistic high resolution sampled images. At the same time, many authors have pointed out that GANs may fail to model the full distribution ("mode collapse") and that using the learned models for anything other than generating samples may be very difficult. In this paper, we examine the utility of GANs in learning statistical models of images by comparing them to perhaps the simplest statistical model, the Gaussian Mixture Model. First, we present a simple method to evaluate generative models based on relative proportions of samples that fall into predetermined bins. Unlike previous automatic methods for evaluating models, our method does not rely on an additional neural network nor does it require approximating intractable computations. Second, we compare the performance of GANs to GMMs trained on the same datasets. While GMMs have previously been shown to be successful in modeling small patches of images, we show how to train them on full sized images despite the high dimensionality. Our results show that GMMs can generate realistic samples (although less sharp than those of GANs) but also capture the full distribution, which GANs fail to do. Furthermore, GMMs allow efficient inference and explicit representation of the underlying statistical structure. Finally, we discuss how a pix2pix network can be used to add high-resolution details to GMM samples while maintaining the basic diversity. 
### 645.A Method Based on Convex Cone Model for Image-Set Classification with  CNN Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12467.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a method for image-set classification based on convex cone models, focusing on the effectiveness of convolutional neural network (CNN) features as inputs. CNN features have non-negative values when using the rectified linear unit as an activation function. This naturally leads us to model a set of CNN features by a convex cone and measure the geometric similarity of convex cones for classification. To establish this framework, we sequentially define multiple angles between two convex cones by repeating the alternating least squares method and then define the geometric similarity between the cones using the obtained angles. Moreover, to enhance our method, we introduce a discriminant space, maximizing the between-class variance (gaps) and minimizes the within-class variance of the projected convex cones onto the discriminant space, similar to a Fisher discriminant analysis. Finally, classification is based on the similarity between projected convex cones. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated experimentally using a private, multi-view hand shape dataset and two public databases. 
### 646.Robust Gyroscope-Aided Camera Self-Calibration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12506.pdf)
> Camera calibration for estimating the intrinsic parameters and lens distortion is a prerequisite for various monocular vision applications including feature tracking and video stabilization. This application paper proposes a model for estimating the parameters on the fly by fusing gyroscope and camera data, both readily available in modern day smartphones. The model is based on joint estimation of visual feature positions, camera parameters, and the camera pose, the movement of which is assumed to follow the movement predicted by the gyroscope. Our model assumes the camera movement to be free, but continuous and differentiable, and individual features are assumed to stay stationary. The estimation is performed online using an extended Kalman filter, and it is shown to outperform existing methods in robustness and insensitivity to initialization. We demonstrate the method using simulated data and empirical data from an iPad. 
### 647.Accurate pedestrian localization in overhead depth images via  Height-Augmented HOG [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12510.pdf)
> We tackle the challenge of reliably and automatically localizing pedestrians in real-life conditions through overhead depth imaging at unprecedented high-density conditions. Leveraging upon a combination of Histogram of Oriented Gradients-like feature descriptors, neural networks, data augmentation and custom data annotation strategies, this work contributes a robust and scalable machine learning-based localization algorithm, which delivers near-human localization performance in real-time, even with local pedestrian density of about 3 ped/m2, a case in which most state-of-the art algorithms degrade significantly in performance. 
### 648.Modeling 4D fMRI Data via Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks  (ST-CNN) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12564.pdf)
> Simultaneous modeling of the spatio-temporal variation patterns of brain functional network from 4D fMRI data has been an important yet challenging problem for the field of cognitive neuroscience and medical image analysis. Inspired by the recent success in applying deep learning for functional brain decoding and encoding, in this work we propose a spatio-temporal convolutional neural network (ST-CNN)to jointly learn the spatial and temporal patterns of targeted network from the training data and perform automatic, pin-pointing functional network identification. The proposed ST-CNN is evaluated by the task of identifying the Default Mode Network (DMN) from fMRI data. Results show that while the framework is only trained on one fMRI dataset,it has the sufficient generalizability to identify the DMN from different populations of data as well as different cognitive tasks. Further investigation into the results show that the superior performance of ST-CNN is driven by the jointly-learning scheme, which capture the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal characteristic of DMN and ensures the accurate identification. 
### 649.Diverse and Controllable Image Captioning with Part-of-Speech Guidance [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12589.pdf)
> Automatically describing an image is an important capability for virtual assistants. Significant progress has been achieved in recent years on this task of image captioning. However, classical prediction techniques based on maximum likelihood trained LSTM nets don't embrace the inherent ambiguity of image captioning. To address this concern, recent variational auto-encoder and generative adversarial network based methods produce a set of captions by sampling from an abstract latent space. But, this latent space has limited interpretability and therefore, a control mechanism for captioning remains an open problem. This paper proposes a captioning technique conditioned on part-of-speech. Our method provides human interpretable control in form of part-of-speech. Importantly, part-of-speech is a language prior, and conditioning on it provides: (i) more diversity as evaluated by counting n-grams and the novel sentences generated, (ii) achieves high accuracy for the diverse captions on standard captioning metrics. 
### 650.Improved Image Captioning with Adversarial Semantic Alignment [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00063.pdf)
> We study image captioning as a conditional GAN training, proposing both a context-aware LSTM captioner and co-attentive discriminator, which enforces semantic alignment between images and captions. We empirically study the viability of two training methods: Self-critical Sequence Training (SCST) and Gumbel Straight-Through (ST). We show that, surprisingly, SCST (a policy gradient method) shows more stable gradient behavior and improved results over Gumbel ST, even without accessing the discriminator gradients directly. We also address the open question of automatic evaluation for these models and introduce a new semantic score and demonstrate its strong correlation to human judgement. As an evaluation paradigm, we suggest that an important criterion is the ability of a captioner to generalize to compositions between objects that do not usually occur together, for which we introduce a captioned Out of Context (OOC) test set. The OOC dataset combined with our semantic score is a new benchmark for the captioning community. Under this OOC benchmark, and the traditional MSCOCO dataset, we show that SCST has a strong performance in both semantic score and human evaluation. 
### 651.PURE: Scalable Phase Unwrapping with Spatial Redundant Arcs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00321.pdf)
> Phase unwrapping is a key problem in many coherent imaging systems, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry. A general formulation for redundant integration of finite differences for phase unwrapping (Costantini et al., 2010) was shown to produce a more reliable solution by exploiting redundant differential estimates. However, this technique requires a commercial linear programming solver for large-scale problems. For a linear cost function, we propose a method based on Dual Decomposition that breaks the given problem defined over a non-planar graph into tractable sub-problems over planar subgraphs. We also propose a decomposition technique that exploits the underlying graph structure for solving the sub-problems efficiently and guarantees asymptotic convergence to the globally optimal solution. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is comparable to the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of the estimate with a better runtime and memory footprint. 
### 652.Sample-to-Sample Correspondence for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00355.pdf)
> The assumption that training and testing samples are generated from the same distribution does not always hold for real-world machine-learning applications. The procedure of tackling this discrepancy between the training (source) and testing (target) domains is known as domain adaptation. We propose an unsupervised version of domain adaptation that considers the presence of only unlabelled data in the target domain. Our approach centers on finding correspondences between samples of each domain. The correspondences are obtained by treating the source and target samples as graphs and using a convex criterion to match them. The criteria used are first-order and second-order similarities between the graphs as well as a class-based regularization. We have also developed a computationally efficient routine for the convex optimization, thus allowing the proposed method to be used widely. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, computer simulations were conducted on synthetic, image classification and sentiment classification datasets. Results validated that the proposed local sample-to-sample matching method out-performs traditional moment-matching methods and is competitive with respect to current local domain-adaptation methods. 
### 653.Customized Image Narrative Generation via Interactive Visual Question  Generation and Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00460.pdf)
> Image description task has been invariably examined in a static manner with qualitative presumptions held to be universally applicable, regardless of the scope or target of the description. In practice, however, different viewers may pay attention to different aspects of the image, and yield different descriptions or interpretations under various contexts. Such diversity in perspectives is difficult to derive with conventional image description techniques. In this paper, we propose a customized image narrative generation task, in which the users are interactively engaged in the generation process by providing answers to the questions. We further attempt to learn the user's interest via repeating such interactive stages, and to automatically reflect the interest in descriptions for new images. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate a variety of descriptions from single image that cover a wider range of topics than conventional models, while being customizable to the target user of interaction. 
### 654.Reconstruction of Simulation-Based Physical Field by Reconstruction  Neural Network Method [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00528.pdf)
> A variety of modeling techniques have been developed in the past decade to reduce the computational expense and improve the accuracy of modeling. In this study, a new framework of modeling is suggested. Compared with other popular methods, a distinctive characteristic is "from image based model to analysis based model (e.g. stress, strain, and deformation)". In such a framework, a reconstruction neural network (ReConNN) model designed for simulation-based physical field's reconstruction is proposed. The ReConNN contains two submodels that are convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial net-work (GAN). The CNN is employed to construct the mapping between contour images of physical field and objective function. Subsequently, the GAN is utilized to generate more images which are similar to the existing contour images. Finally, Lagrange polynomial is applied to complete the reconstruction. However, the existing CNN models are commonly applied to the classification tasks, which seem to be difficult to handle with regression tasks of images. Meanwhile, the existing GAN architectures are insufficient to generate high-accuracy "pseudo contour images". Therefore, a ReConNN model based on a Convolution in Convolution (CIC) and a Convolutional AutoEncoder based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN-CAE) is suggested. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model representatively, a classical topology optimization procedure is considered. Then the ReConNN is utilized to the reconstruction of heat transfer process of a pin fin heat sink. It demonstrates that the proposed ReConNN model is proved to be a potential capability to reconstruct physical field for multidisciplinary, such as structural optimization. 
### 655.Spectral clustering algorithms for the detection of clusters in  block-cyclic and block-acyclic graphs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00862.pdf)
> We propose two spectral algorithms for partitioning nodes in directed graphs respectively with a cyclic and an acyclic pattern of connection between groups of nodes. Our methods are based on the computation of extremal eigenvalues of the transition matrix associated to the directed graph. The two algorithms outperform state-of-the art methods for directed graph clustering on synthetic datasets, including methods based on blockmodels, bibliometric symmetrization and random walks. Our algorithms have the same space complexity as classical spectral clustering algorithms for undirected graphs and their time complexity is also linear in the number of edges in the graph. One of our methods is applied to a trophic network based on predator-prey relationships. It successfully extracts common categories of preys and predators encountered in food chains. The same method is also applied to highlight the hierarchical structure of a worldwide network of Autonomous Systems depicting business agreements between Internet Service Providers. 
### 656.Images &amp; Recipes: Retrieval in the cooking context [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00900.pdf)
> Recent advances in the machine learning community allowed different use cases to emerge, as its association to domains like cooking which created the computational cuisine. In this paper, we tackle the picture-recipe alignment problem, having as target application the large-scale retrieval task (finding a recipe given a picture, and vice versa). Our approach is validated on the Recipe1M dataset, composed of one million image-recipe pairs and additional class information, for which we achieve state-of-the-art results. 
### 657.Multimodal Emotion Recognition for One-Minute-Gradual Emotion Challenge [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01060.pdf)
> The continuous dimensional emotion modelled by arousal and valence can depict complex changes of emotions. In this paper, we present our works on arousal and valence predictions for One-Minute-Gradual (OMG) Emotion Challenge. Multimodal representations are first extracted from videos using a variety of acoustic, video and textual models and support vector machine (SVM) is then used for fusion of multimodal signals to make final predictions. Our solution achieves Concordant Correlation Coefficient (CCC) scores of 0.397 and 0.520 on arousal and valence respectively for the validation dataset, which outperforms the baseline systems with the best CCC scores of 0.15 and 0.23 on arousal and valence by a large margin. 
### 658.Noise Invariant Frame Selection: A Simple Method to Address the  Background Noise Problem for Text-independent Speaker Verification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01259.pdf)
> The performance of speaker-related systems usually degrades heavily in practical applications largely due to the presence of background noise. To improve the robustness of such systems in unknown noisy environments, this paper proposes a simple pre-processing method called Noise Invariant Frame Selection (NIFS). Based on several noisy constraints, it selects noise invariant frames from utterances to represent speakers. Experiments conducted on the TIMIT database showed that the NIFS can significantly improve the performance of Vector Quantization (VQ), Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM) and i-vector-based speaker verification systems in different unknown noisy environments with different SNRs, in comparison to their baselines. Meanwhile, the proposed NIFS-based speaker verification systems achieves similar performance when we change the constraints (hyper-parameters) or features, which indicates that it is robust and easy to reproduce. Since NIFS is designed as a general algorithm, it could be further applied to other similar tasks. 
### 659.Spiking Deep Residual Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01352.pdf)
> Recently, spiking neural network (SNN) has received significant attentions for its biological plausibility. SNN theoretically has at least the same computational power as traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), and it has the potential to achieve revolutionary energy-efficiency. However, at current stage, it is still a big challenge to train a very deep SNN. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to build a spiking version of deep residual network (ResNet), which represents the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We employ the idea of converting a trained ResNet to a network of spiking neurons named Spiking ResNet. To address the conversion problem, we propose a shortcut normalisation mechanism to appropriately scale continuous-valued activations to match firing rates in SNN, and a layer-wise error compensation approach to reduce the error caused by discretisation. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that the proposed Spiking ResNet yields the state-of-the-art performance of SNNs. 
### 660.Framewise approach in multimodal emotion recognition in OMG challenge [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01369.pdf)
> In this report we described our approach achieves $53\%$ of unweighted accuracy over $7$ emotions and $0.05$ and $0.09$ mean squared errors for arousal and valence in OMG emotion recognition challenge. Our results were obtained with ensemble of single modality models trained on voice and face data from video separately. We consider each stream as a sequence of frames. Next we estimated features from frames and handle it with recurrent neural network. As audio frame we mean short $0.4$ second spectrogram interval. For features estimation for face pictures we used own ResNet neural network pretrained on AffectNet database. Each short spectrogram was considered as a picture and processed by convolutional network too. As a base audio model we used ResNet pretrained in speaker recognition task. Predictions from both modalities were fused on decision level and improve single-channel approaches by a few percent 
### 661.Dimensional emotion recognition using visual and textual cues [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01416.pdf)
> This paper addresses the problem of automatic emotion recognition in the scope of the One-Minute Gradual-Emotional Behavior challenge (OMG-Emotion challenge). The underlying objective of the challenge is the automatic estimation of emotion expressions in the two-dimensional emotion representation space (i.e., arousal and valence). The adopted methodology is a weighted ensemble of several models from both video and text modalities. For video-based recognition, two different types of visual cues (i.e., face and facial landmarks) were considered to feed a multi-input deep neural network. Regarding the text modality, a sequential model based on a simple recurrent architecture was implemented. In addition, we also introduce a model based on high-level features in order to embed domain knowledge in the learning process. Experimental results on the OMG-Emotion validation set demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented ensemble model as it clearly outperforms the current baseline methods. 
### 662.Towards a Spectrum of Graph Convolutional Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01837.pdf)
> We present our ongoing work on understanding the limitations of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) as well as our work on generalizations of graph convolutions for representing more complex node attribute dependencies. Based on an analysis of GCNs with the help of the corresponding computation graphs, we propose a generalization of existing GCNs where the aggregation operations are (a) determined by structural properties of the local neighborhood graphs and (b) not restricted to weighted averages. We show that the proposed approach is strictly more expressive while requiring only a modest increase in the number of parameters and computations. We also show that the proposed generalization is identical to standard convolutional layers when applied to regular grid graphs. 
### 663.RMDL: Random Multimodel Deep Learning for Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01890.pdf)
> The continually increasing number of complex datasets each year necessitates ever improving machine learning methods for robust and accurate categorization of these data. This paper introduces Random Multimodel Deep Learning (RMDL): a new ensemble, deep learning approach for classification. Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results across many domains. RMDL solves the problem of finding the best deep learning structure and architecture while simultaneously improving robustness and accuracy through ensembles of deep learning architectures. RDML can accept as input a variety data to include text, video, images, and symbolic. This paper describes RMDL and shows test results for image and text data including MNIST, CIFAR-10, WOS, Reuters, IMDB, and 20newsgroup. These test results show that RDML produces consistently better performance than standard methods over a broad range of data types and classification problems. 
### 664.Weakly-supervised Visual Instrument-playing Action Detection in Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02031.pdf)
> Instrument playing is among the most common scenes in music-related videos, which represent nowadays one of the largest sources of online videos. In order to understand the instrument-playing scenes in the videos, it is important to know what instruments are played, when they are played, and where the playing actions occur in the scene. While audio-based recognition of instruments has been widely studied, the visual aspect of the music instrument playing remains largely unaddressed in the literature. One of the main obstacles is the difficulty in collecting annotated data of the action locations for training-based methods. To address this issue, we propose a weakly-supervised framework to find when and where the instruments are played in the videos. We propose to use two auxiliary models, a sound model and an object model, to provide supervisions for training the instrument-playing action model. The sound model provides temporal supervisions, while the object model provides spatial supervisions. They together can simultaneously provide temporal and spatial supervisions. The resulted model only needs to analyze the visual part of a music video to deduce which, when and where instruments are played. We found that the proposed method significantly improves the localization accuracy. We evaluate the result of the proposed method temporally and spatially on a small dataset (totally 5,400 frames) that we manually annotated. 
### 665.Reachability Analysis of Deep Neural Networks with Provable Guarantees [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02242.pdf)
> Verifying correctness of deep neural networks (DNNs) is challenging. We study a generic reachability problem for feed-forward DNNs which, for a given set of inputs to the network and a Lipschitz-continuous function over its outputs, computes the lower and upper bound on the function values. Because the network and the function are Lipschitz continuous, all values in the interval between the lower and upper bound are reachable. We show how to obtain the safety verification problem, the output range analysis problem and a robustness measure by instantiating the reachability problem. We present a novel algorithm based on adaptive nested optimisation to solve the reachability problem. The technique has been implemented and evaluated on a range of DNNs, demonstrating its efficiency, scalability and ability to handle a broader class of networks than state-of-the-art verification approaches. 
### 666.Visual Global Localization with a Hybrid WNN-CNN Approach [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03183.pdf)
> Currently, self-driving cars rely greatly on the Global Positioning System (GPS) infrastructure, albeit there is an increasing demand for alternative methods for GPS-denied environments. One of them is known as place recognition, which associates images of places with their corresponding positions. We previously proposed systems based on Weightless Neural Networks (WNN) to address this problem as a classification task. This encompasses solely one part of the global localization, which is not precise enough for driverless cars. Instead of just recognizing past places and outputting their poses, it is desired that a global localization system estimates the pose of current place images. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem as follows. Firstly, given a live image, the place recognition system returns the most similar image and its pose. Then, given live and recollected images, a visual localization system outputs the relative camera pose represented by those images. To estimate the relative camera pose between the recollected and the current images, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained with the two images as input and a relative pose vector as output. Together, these systems solve the global localization problem using the topological and metric information to approximate the current vehicle pose. The full approach is compared to a Real- Time Kinematic GPS system and a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system. Experimental results show that the proposed approach correctly localizes a vehicle 90% of the time with a mean error of 1.20m compared to 1.12m of the SLAM system and 0.37m of the GPS, 89% of the time. 
### 667.Controlling the privacy loss with the input feature maps of the layers  in convolutional neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03444.pdf)
> We propose the method to sanitize the privacy of the IFM(Input Feature Map)s that are fed into the layers of CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)s. The method introduces the degree of the sanitization that makes the application using a CNN be able to control the privacy loss represented as the ratio of the probabilistic accuracies for original IFM and sanitized IFM. For the sanitization of an IFM, the sample-and-hold based approximation scheme is devised to satisfy an application-specific degree of the sanitization. The scheme approximates an IFM by replacing all the samples in a window with the non-zero sample closest to the mean of the sampling window. It also removes the dependency on CNN configuration by unfolding multi-dimensional IFM tensors into one-dimensional streams to be approximated. 
### 668.Full 3D Reconstruction of Transparent Objects [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03482.pdf)
> Numerous techniques have been proposed for reconstructing 3D models for opaque objects in past decades. However, none of them can be directly applied to transparent objects. This paper presents a fully automatic approach for reconstructing complete 3D shapes of transparent objects. Through positioning an object on a turntable, its silhouettes and light refraction paths under different viewing directions are captured. Then, starting from an initial rough model generated from space carving, our algorithm progressively optimizes the model under three constraints: surface and refraction normal consistency, surface projection and silhouette consistency, and surface smoothness. Experimental results on both synthetic and real objects demonstrate that our method can successfully recover the complex shapes of transparent objects and faithfully reproduce their light refraction properties. 
### 669.Adaptive Selection of Deep Learning Models on Embedded Systems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04252.pdf)
> The recent ground-breaking advances in deep learning networks ( DNNs ) make them attractive for embedded systems. However, it can take a long time for DNNs to make an inference on resource-limited embedded devices. Offloading the computation into the cloud is often infeasible due to privacy concerns, high latency, or the lack of connectivity. As such, there is a critical need to find a way to effectively execute the DNN models locally on the devices. This paper presents an adaptive scheme to determine which DNN model to use for a given input, by considering the desired accuracy and inference time. Our approach employs machine learning to develop a predictive model to quickly select a pre-trained DNN to use for a given input and the optimization constraint. We achieve this by first training off-line a predictive model, and then use the learnt model to select a DNN model to use for new, unseen inputs. We apply our approach to the image classification task and evaluate it on a Jetson TX2 embedded deep learning platform using the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 validation dataset. We consider a range of influential DNN models. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a 7.52% improvement in inference accuracy, and a 1.8x reduction in inference time over the most-capable single DNN model. 
### 670.Non-Stationary Texture Synthesis by Adversarial Expansion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04487.pdf)
> The real world exhibits an abundance of non-stationary textures. Examples include textures with large-scale structures, as well as spatially variant and inhomogeneous textures. While existing example-based texture synthesis methods can cope well with stationary textures, non-stationary textures still pose a considerable challenge, which remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a new approach for example-based non-stationary texture synthesis. Our approach uses a generative adversarial network (GAN), trained to double the spatial extent of texture blocks extracted from a specific texture exemplar. Once trained, the fully convolutional generator is able to expand the size of the entire exemplar, as well as of any of its sub-blocks. We demonstrate that this conceptually simple approach is highly effective for capturing large-scale structures, as well as other non-stationary attributes of the input exemplar. As a result, it can cope with challenging textures, which, to our knowledge, no other existing method can handle. 
### 671.Scene-Aware Audio for 360\textdegree{} Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04792.pdf)
> Although 360\textdegree{} cameras ease the capture of panoramic footage, it remains challenging to add realistic 360\textdegree{} audio that blends into the captured scene and is synchronized with the camera motion. We present a method for adding scene-aware spatial audio to 360\textdegree{} videos in typical indoor scenes, using only a conventional mono-channel microphone and a speaker. We observe that the late reverberation of a room's impulse response is usually diffuse spatially and directionally. Exploiting this fact, we propose a method that synthesizes the directional impulse response between any source and listening locations by combining a synthesized early reverberation part and a measured late reverberation tail. The early reverberation is simulated using a geometric acoustic simulation and then enhanced using a frequency modulation method to capture room resonances. The late reverberation is extracted from a recorded impulse response, with a carefully chosen time duration that separates out the late reverberation from the early reverberation. In our validations, we show that our synthesized spatial audio matches closely with recordings using ambisonic microphones. Lastly, we demonstrate the strength of our method in several applications. 
### 672.Token-level and sequence-level loss smoothing for RNN language models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05062.pdf)
> Despite the effectiveness of recurrent neural network language models, their maximum likelihood estimation suffers from two limitations. It treats all sentences that do not match the ground truth as equally poor, ignoring the structure of the output space. Second, it suffers from "exposure bias": during training tokens are predicted given ground-truth sequences, while at test time prediction is conditioned on generated output sequences. To overcome these limitations we build upon the recent reward augmented maximum likelihood approach \ie sequence-level smoothing that encourages the model to predict sentences close to the ground truth according to a given performance metric. We extend this approach to token-level loss smoothing, and propose improvements to the sequence-level smoothing approach. Our experiments on two different tasks, image captioning and machine translation, show that token-level and sequence-level loss smoothing are complementary, and significantly improve results. 
### 673.Hu-Fu: Hardware and Software Collaborative Attack Framework against  Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05098.pdf)
> Recently, Deep Learning (DL), especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), develops rapidly and is applied to many tasks, such as image classification, face recognition, image segmentation, and human detection. Due to its superior performance, DL-based models have a wide range of application in many areas, some of which are extremely safety-critical, e.g. intelligent surveillance and autonomous driving. Due to the latency and privacy problem of cloud computing, embedded accelerators are popular in these safety-critical areas. However, the robustness of the embedded DL system might be harmed by inserting hardware/software Trojans into the accelerator and the neural network model, since the accelerator and deploy tool (or neural network model) are usually provided by third-party companies. Fortunately, inserting hardware Trojans can only achieve inflexible attack, which means that hardware Trojans can easily break down the whole system or exchange two outputs, but can't make CNN recognize unknown pictures as targets. Though inserting software Trojans has more freedom of attack, it often requires tampering input images, which is not easy for attackers. So, in this paper, we propose a hardware-software collaborative attack framework to inject hidden neural network Trojans, which works as a back-door without requiring manipulating input images and is flexible for different scenarios. We test our attack framework for image classification and face recognition tasks, and get attack success rate of 92.6% and 100% on CIFAR10 and YouTube Faces, respectively, while keeping almost the same accuracy as the unattacked model in the normal mode. In addition, we show a specific attack scenario in which a face recognition system is attacked and gives a specific wrong answer. 
### 674.Knowledge Distillation with Adversarial Samples Supporting Decision  Boundary [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05532.pdf)
> Many recent works on knowledge distillation have provided ways to transfer the knowledge of a trained network for improving the learning process of a new one, but finding a good technique for knowledge distillation is still an open problem. In this paper, we provide a new perspective based on a decision boundary, which is one of the most important component of a classifier. The generalization performance of a classifier is closely related to the adequacy of its decision boundary, so a good classifier bears a good decision boundary. Therefore, transferring information closely related to the decision boundary can be a good attempt for knowledge distillation. To realize this goal, we utilize an adversarial attack to discover samples supporting a decision boundary. Based on this idea, to transfer more accurate information about the decision boundary, the proposed algorithm trains a student classifier based on the adversarial samples supporting the decision boundary. Experiments show that the proposed method indeed improves knowledge distillation and achieves the state-of-the-arts performance. 
### 675.Stories for Images-in-Sequence by using Visual and Narrative Components [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05622.pdf)
> Recent research in AI is focusing towards generating narrative stories about visual scenes. It has the potential to achieve more human-like understanding than just basic description generation of images- in-sequence. In this work, we propose a solution for generating stories for images-in-sequence that is based on the Sequence to Sequence model. As a novelty, our encoder model is composed of two separate encoders, one that models the behaviour of the image sequence and other that models the sentence-story generated for the previous image in the sequence of images. By using the image sequence encoder we capture the temporal dependencies between the image sequence and the sentence-story and by using the previous sentence-story encoder we achieve a better story flow. Our solution generates long human-like stories that not only describe the visual context of the image sequence but also contains narrative and evaluative language. The obtained results were confirmed by manual human evaluation. 
### 676.Efficient end-to-end learning for quantizable representations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05809.pdf)
> Embedding representation learning via neural networks is at the core foundation of modern similarity based search. While much effort has been put in developing algorithms for learning binary hamming code representations for search efficiency, this still requires a linear scan of the entire dataset per each query and trades off the search accuracy through binarization. To this end, we consider the problem of directly learning a quantizable embedding representation and the sparse binary hash code end-to-end which can be used to construct an efficient hash table not only providing significant search reduction in the number of data but also achieving the state of the art search accuracy outperforming previous state of the art deep metric learning methods. We also show that finding the optimal sparse binary hash code in a mini-batch can be computed exactly in polynomial time by solving a minimum cost flow problem. Our results on Cifar-100 and on ImageNet datasets show the state of the art search accuracy in precision@k and NMI metrics while providing up to 98X and 478X search speedup respectively over exhaustive linear search.

### 677.Understanding and Controlling User Linkability in Decentralized Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05838.pdf)
> Machine Learning techniques are widely used by online services (e.g. Google, Apple) in order to analyze and make predictions on user data. As many of the provided services are user-centric (e.g. personal photo collections, speech recognition, personal assistance), user data generated on personal devices is key to provide the service. In order to protect the data and the privacy of the user, federated learning techniques have been proposed where the data never leaves the user's device and "only" model updates are communicated back to the server. In our work, we propose a new threat model that is not concerned with learning about the content - but rather is concerned with the linkability of users during such decentralized learning scenarios. <br />We show that model updates are characteristic for users and therefore lend themselves to linkability attacks. We show identification and matching of users across devices in closed and open world scenarios. In our experiments, we find our attacks to be highly effective, achieving 20x-175x chance-level performance. <br />In order to mitigate the risks of linkability attacks, we study various strategies. As adding random noise does not offer convincing operation points, we propose strategies based on using calibrated domain-specific data; we find these strategies offers substantial protection against linkability threats with little effect to utility. 
### 678.Ask No More: Deciding when to guess in referential visual dialogue [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06960.pdf)
> Our goal is to explore how the abilities brought in by a dialogue manager can be included in end-to-end visually grounded conversational agents. We make initial steps towards this general goal by augmenting a task-oriented visual dialogue model with a decision-making component that decides whether to ask a follow-up question to identify a target referent in an image, or to stop the conversation to make a guess. Our analyses show that adding a decision making component produces dialogues that are less repetitive and that include fewer unnecessary questions, thus potentially leading to more efficient and less unnatural interactions. 
### 679.AlphaX: eXploring Neural Architectures with Deep Neural Networks and  Monte Carlo Tree Search [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07440.pdf)
> We present AlphaX, a fully automated agent that designs complex neural architectures from scratch. AlphaX explores the exponentially exploded search space with a novel distributed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a Meta-Deep Neural Network (DNN). MCTS intrinsically improves the search efficiency by automatically balancing the exploration and exploitation at each state, while Meta-DNN predicts the network accuracy to guide the search, and to provide an estimated reward for the preemptive backpropagation in the distributed setup. As the search progresses, AlphaX also generates the training date for Meta-DNN. So, the learning of Meta-DNN is end-to-end. In searching for NASNet style architectures, AlphaX found several promising architectures with up to 1% higher accuracy than NASNet using only 17 GPUs for 5 days, demonstrating up to 23.5x speedup over the original searching for NASNet that used 500 GPUs in 4 days. 
### 680.Self-Training Ensemble Networks for Zero-Shot Image Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07473.pdf)
> Despite the advancement of supervised image recognition algorithms, their de- pendence on the availability of labeled data and the rapid expansion of image categories raise the significant challenge of zero-shot learning. Zero-shot learn- ing (ZSL) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled classes into unlabeled classes to reduce human labeling effort. In this paper, we propose a novel self-training ensemble network model to address zero-shot image recognition. The ensemble network is built by learning multiple image classification functions with a shared feature extraction network but different label embedding representations, each of which facilitates information transfer to different subsets of unlabeled classes. A self-training framework is then deployed to iteratively label the most confident images in each unlabeled class with predicted pseudo-labels and update the ensem- ble network with the training data augmented by the pseudo-labels. The proposed model performs training on both labeled and unlabeled data. It can naturally bridge the domain shift problem in visual appearances and be extended to the generalized zero-shot learning scenario. We conduct experiments on multiple standard ZSL datasets and the empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model. 
### 681.Improved Learning of One-hidden-layer Convolutional Neural Networks with  Overlaps [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07798.pdf)
> We propose a new algorithm to learn a one-hidden-layer convolutional neural network where both the convolutional weights and the outputs weights are parameters to be learned. Our algorithm works for a general class of (potentially overlapping) patches, including commonly used structures for computer vision tasks. Our algorithm draws ideas from (1) isotonic regression for learning neural networks and (2) landscape analysis of non-convex matrix factorization problems. We believe these findings may inspire further development in designing provable algorithms for learning neural networks and other complex models. 
### 682.Learning Real-World Robot Policies by Dreaming [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07813.pdf)
> Learning to control robots directly based on images is a primary challenge in robotics. However, many existing reinforcement learning approaches require iteratively obtaining millions of samples to learn a policy which can take significant time. In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning real-world robot action policies solely based on a few random off-policy initial samples. We learn a realistic dreaming model that can emulate samples equivalent to a sequence of images from the actual environment, and make the agent learn action policies by interacting with the dreaming model rather than the real-world. We experimentally confirm that our dreaming model can learn realistic policies that transfer to the real-world. 
### 683.Generalized Cross Entropy Loss for Training Deep Neural Networks with  Noisy Labels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07836.pdf)
> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in a variety of applications across many disciplines. Yet, their superior performance comes with the expensive cost of requiring correctly annotated large-scale datasets. Moreover, due to DNNs' rich capacity, errors in training labels can hamper performance. To combat this problem, mean absolute error (MAE) has recently been proposed as a noise-robust alternative to the commonly-used categorical cross entropy (CCE) loss. However, as we show in this paper, MAE can perform poorly with DNNs and challenging datasets. Here, we present a theoretically grounded set of noise-robust loss functions that can be seen as a generalization of MAE and CCE. Proposed loss functions can be readily applied with any existing DNN architecture and algorithm, while yielding good performance in a wide range of noisy label scenarios. We report results from experiments conducted with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and FASHION-MNIST datasets and synthetically generated noisy labels. 
### 684.Parallel Transport Convolution: A New Tool for Convolutional Neural  Networks on Manifolds [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07857.pdf)
> Convolution has been playing a prominent role in various applications in science and engineering for many years. It is the most important operation in convolutional neural networks. There has been a recent growth of interests of research in generalizing convolutions on curved domains such as manifolds and graphs. However, existing approaches cannot preserve all the desirable properties of Euclidean convolutions, namely compactly supported filters, directionality, transferability across different manifolds. In this paper we develop a new generalization of the convolution operation, referred to as parallel transport convolution (PTC), on Riemannian manifolds and their discrete counterparts. PTC is designed based on the parallel transportation which is able to translate information along a manifold and to intrinsically preserve directionality. PTC allows for the construction of compactly supported filters and is also robust to manifold deformations. This enables us to preform wavelet-like operations and to define deep convolutional neural networks on curved domains. 
### 685.Featurized Bidirectional GAN: Adversarial Defense via Adversarially  Learned Semantic Inference [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07862.pdf)
> Deep neural networks have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations are intentionally added to the original inputs to fool the classifier. In this paper, we propose a defense method, Featurized Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (FBGAN), to capture the semantic features of the input and filter the non-semantic perturbation. FBGAN is pre-trained on the clean dataset in an unsupervised manner, adversarially learning a bidirectional mapping between the high-dimensional data space and the low-dimensional semantic space, and mutual information is applied to disentangle the semantically meaningful features. After the bidirectional mapping, the adversarial data can be reconstructed to denoised data, which could be fed into the classifier for classification. We empirically show the quality of reconstruction images and the effectiveness of defense. 
### 686.Generative Adversarial Examples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07894.pdf)
> Adversarial examples are typically constructed by perturbing an existing data point, and current defense methods are focused on guarding against this type of attack. In this paper, we propose a new class of adversarial examples that are synthesized entirely from scratch using a conditional generative model. We first train an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) to model the class-conditional distribution over inputs. Then, conditioned on a desired class, we search over the AC-GAN latent space to find images that are likely under the generative model and are misclassified by a target classifier. We demonstrate through human evaluation that this new kind of adversarial inputs, which we call Generative Adversarial Examples, are legitimate and belong to the desired class. Our empirical results on the MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA datasets show that generative adversarial examples can easily bypass strong adversarial training and certified defense methods which can foil existing adversarial attacks. 
### 687.Quantizing Convolutional Neural Networks for Low-Power High-Throughput  Inference Engines [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07941.pdf)
> Deep learning as a means to inferencing has proliferated thanks to its versatility and ability to approach or exceed human-level accuracy. These computational models have seemingly insatiable appetites for computational resources not only while training, but also when deployed at scales ranging from data centers all the way down to embedded devices. As such, increasing consideration is being made to maximize the computational efficiency given limited hardware and energy resources and, as a result, inferencing with reduced precision has emerged as a viable alternative to the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic. We propose a quantization scheme that allows inferencing to be carried out using arithmetic that is fundamentally more efficient when compared to even half-precision floating-point. Our quantization procedure is significant in that we determine our quantization scheme parameters by calibrating against its reference floating-point model using a single inference batch rather than (re)training and achieve end-to-end post quantization accuracies comparable to the reference model. 
### 688.Small steps and giant leaps: Minimal Newton solvers for Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08095.pdf)
> We propose a fast second-order method that can be used as a drop-in replacement for current deep learning solvers. Compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), it only requires two additional forward-mode automatic differentiation operations per iteration, which has a computational cost comparable to two standard forward passes and is easy to implement. Our method addresses long-standing issues with current second-order solvers, which invert an approximate Hessian matrix every iteration exactly or by conjugate-gradient methods, a procedure that is both costly and sensitive to noise. Instead, we propose to keep a single estimate of the gradient projected by the inverse Hessian matrix, and update it once per iteration. This estimate has the same size and is similar to the momentum variable that is commonly used in SGD. No estimate of the Hessian is maintained. We first validate our method, called CurveBall, on small problems with known closed-form solutions (noisy Rosenbrock function and degenerate 2-layer linear networks), where current deep learning solvers seem to struggle. We then train several large models on CIFAR and ImageNet, including ResNet and VGG-f networks, where we demonstrate faster convergence with no hyperparameter tuning. Code is available. 
### 689.Classifier-agnostic saliency map extraction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08249.pdf)
> We argue for the importance of decoupling saliency map extraction from any specific classifier. We propose a practical algorithm to train a classifier-agnostic saliency mapping by simultaneously training a classifier and a saliency mapping. The proposed algorithm is motivated as finding the mapping that is not strongly coupled with any specific classifier. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the proposed approach and verify that it extracts higher quality saliency maps compared to the existing approaches that are dependent on a fixed classifier. The proposed approach performs well even on images containing objects from classes unseen during training. 
### 690.AgileNet: Lightweight Dictionary-based Few-shot Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08311.pdf)
> The success of deep learning models is heavily tied to the use of massive amount of labeled data and excessively long training time. With the emergence of intelligent edge applications that use these models, the critical challenge is to obtain the same inference capability on a resource-constrained device while providing adaptability to cope with the dynamic changes in the data. We propose AgileNet, a novel lightweight dictionary-based few-shot learning methodology which provides reduced complexity deep neural network for efficient execution at the edge while enabling low-cost updates to capture the dynamics of the new data. Evaluations of state-of-the-art few-shot learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior accuracy of AgileNet compared to prior arts. Additionally, AgileNet is the first few-shot learning approach that prevents model updates by eliminating the knowledge obtained from the primary training. This property is ensured through the dictionaries learned by our novel end-to-end structured decomposition, which also reduces the memory footprint and computation complexity to match the edge device constraints. 
### 691.Joint Image Captioning and Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08389.pdf)
> Answering visual questions need acquire daily common knowledge and model the semantic connection among different parts in images, which is too difficult for VQA systems to learn from images with the only supervision from answers. Meanwhile, image captioning systems with beam search strategy tend to generate similar captions and fail to diversely describe images. To address the aforementioned issues, we present a system to have these two tasks compensate with each other, which is capable of jointly producing image captions and answering visual questions. In particular, we utilize question and image features to generate question-related captions and use the generated captions as additional features to provide new knowledge to the VQA system. For image captioning, our system attains more informative results in term of the relative improvements on VQA tasks as well as competitive results using automated metrics. Applying our system to the VQA tasks, our results on VQA v2 dataset achieve 65.8% using generated captions and 69.1% using annotated captions in validation set and 68.4% in the test-standard set. Further, an ensemble of 10 models results in 69.7% in the test-standard split. 
### 692.Classification Uncertainty of Deep Neural Networks Based on Gradient  Information [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08440.pdf)
> We study the quantification of uncertainty of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based on gradient metrics. Unlike the classical softmax entropy, such metrics gather information from all layers of the CNN. We show for the EMNIST digits data set that for several such metrics we achieve the same meta classification accuracy -- i.e. the task of classifying predictions as correct or incorrect without knowing the actual label -- as for entropy thresholding. We apply meta classification to unknown concepts (out-of-distribution samples) -- EMNIST/Omniglot letters, CIFAR10 and noise -- and demonstrate that meta classification rates for unknown concepts can be increased when using entropy together with several gradient based metrics as input quantities for a meta classifier. Meta classifiers only trained on the uncertainty metrics of known concepts, i.e. EMNIST digits, usually do not perform equally well for all unknown concepts. If we however allow the meta classifier to be trained on uncertainty metrics for some out-of-distribution samples, meta classification for concepts remote from EMNIST digits (then termed known unknowns) can be improved considerably. 
### 693.A 2D laser rangefinder scans dataset of standard EUR pallets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08564.pdf)
> In the past few years, the technology of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) has notably advanced. In particular, in the field of factory and warehouse automation, different approaches have been presented for detecting and localizing pallets inside warehouses and shop-floor environments based on the data acquired from 2D laser rangefinders. In [1], we present a robust approach allowing AGVs to detect, localize, and track multiple pallets using machine learning techniques based on an on-board 2D laser rangefinder. In this paper, the data used in [1, 2] for solving the problem of detection, localization and tracking of pallets is described. Furthermore, we present an open repository of dataset and code to the community for further research activities. The dataset comprises a collection of 565 2D scans from real-world environments, which are divided into 340 samples where pallets are present, whereas 225 samples represent the case in which no pallets are present. 
### 694.Deep Feature Aggregation with Heat Diffusion for Image Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08587.pdf)
> Image-level feature descriptors obtained from convolutional neural networks have shown powerful representation capabilities for image retrieval. In this paper, we present an unsupervised method to aggregate deep convolutional features into compact yet discriminative image vectors by simulating the dynamics of heat diffusion. A distinctive problem in image retrieval is that repetitive or bursty features tend to dominate feature representations, leading to less than ideal matches. We show that by considering each deep feature as a heat source, our method is able to avoiding over-representation of bursty features. We additionally provide a practical solution for the proposed aggregation method, which is further demonstrated in our experimental evaluation. Finally, we extensively evaluate the proposed approach with pre-trained and fine-tuned deep networks on common public benchmarks, and show superior performance compared to previous work. 
### 695.Robust Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08657.pdf)
> Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) have led to large improvements in the task of conditional image generation, which lies at the heart of computer vision. The major focus so far has been on performance improvement, while there has been little effort in making cGAN more robust to noise or leveraging structure in the output space of the model. The end-to-end regression (of the generator) might lead to arbitrarily large errors in the output, which is unsuitable for the application of such networks to real-world systems. In this work, we introduce a novel conditional GAN, called RoCGAN, which adds implicit constraints to address the issue. Our proposed model augments the generator with an unsupervised pathway, which encourages the outputs of the generator to span the target manifold even in the presence of large amounts of noise. We prove that RoCGAN shares similar theoretical properties as GAN and experimentally verify that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art cGAN architectures by a large margin in a variety of domains including images from natural scenes and faces. 
### 696.COCO-CN for Cross-Lingual Image Tagging, Captioning and Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08661.pdf)
> This paper contributes to cross-lingual image annotation and retrieval in terms of data and methods. We propose COCO-CN, a novel dataset enriching MS-COCO with manually written Chinese sentences and tags. For more effective annotation acquisition, we develop a recommendation-assisted collective annotation system, automatically providing an annotator with several tags and sentences deemed to be relevant with respect to the pictorial content. Having 20,342 images annotated with 27,218 Chinese sentences and 70,993 tags, COCO-CN is currently the largest Chinese-English dataset applicable for cross-lingual image tagging, captioning and retrieval. We develop methods per task for effectively learning from cross-lingual resources. Extensive experiments on the multiple tasks justify the viability of our dataset and methods. 
### 697.Approximate Newton-based statistical inference using only stochastic  gradients [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08920.pdf)
> We present a novel inference framework for convex empirical risk minimization, using approximate stochastic Newton steps. The proposed algorithm is based on the notion of finite differences and allows the approximation of a Hessian-vector product from first-order information. In theory, our method efficiently computes the statistical error covariance in $M$-estimation, both for unregularized convex learning problems and high-dimensional LASSO regression, without using exact second order information, or resampling the entire data set. In practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on large-scale machine learning problems, that go even beyond convexity: as a highlight, our work can be used to detect certain adversarial attacks on neural networks. 
### 698.Toward a Thinking Microscope: Deep Learning in Optical Microscopy and  Image Reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08970.pdf)
> We discuss recently emerging applications of the state-of-art deep learning methods on optical microscopy and microscopic image reconstruction, which enable new transformations among different modes and modalities of microscopic imaging, driven entirely by image data. We believe that deep learning will fundamentally change both the hardware and image reconstruction methods used in optical microscopy in a holistic manner. 
### 699.Particle Filter Networks with Application to Visual Localization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08975.pdf)
> Particle filtering is a powerful method for sequential state estimation and is extensively used in many domains, including robot localization, visual tracking, etc. To apply particle filters in practice, a main challenge is to construct an effective probabilistic system model, especially when the system exhibits complex dynamic behavior or processes rich sensor information from, e.g., visual cameras. This paper introduces the Particle Filter Network (PF-Net), which captures both a system model and the particle filter algorithm in a single neural network. This unified network representation enables end-to-end model learning, which trains the model in the context of a specific algorithm, resulting in improved performance, compared with conventional model-learning methods. We apply PF-net to visual robot localization. The robot must localize in rich 3-D environments, using only a schematic 2-D floor map. In preliminary experiments, PF-Net consistently outperformed alternative learning architectures, as well as conventional model-based localization methods. PF-net learns effective models that generalize to new, unseen environments. It can also incorporate semantic labels on the floor map. 
### 700.The Topology ToolKit [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09110.pdf)
> This system paper presents the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a software platform designed for topological data analysis in scientific visualization. TTK provides a unified, generic, efficient, and robust implementation of key algorithms for the topological analysis of scalar data, including: critical points, integral lines, persistence diagrams, persistence curves, merge trees, contour trees, Morse-Smale complexes, fiber surfaces, continuous scatterplots, Jacobi sets, Reeb spaces, and more. TTK is easily accessible to end users due to a tight integration with ParaView. It is also easily accessible to developers through a variety of bindings (Python, VTK/C++) for fast prototyping or through direct, dependence-free, C++, to ease integration into pre-existing complex systems. While developing TTK, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. In particular, we present an algorithm for the construction of a discrete gradient that complies to the critical points extracted in the piecewise-linear setting. This algorithm guarantees a combinatorial consistency across the topological abstractions supported by TTK, and importantly, a unified implementation of topological data simplification for multi-scale exploration and analysis. We also present a cached triangulation data structure, that supports time efficient and generic traversals, which self-adjusts its memory usage on demand for input simplicial meshes and which implicitly emulates a triangulation for regular grids with no memory overhead. Finally, we describe an original software architecture, which guarantees memory efficient and direct accesses to TTK features, while still allowing for researchers powerful and easy bindings and extensions. TTK is open source (BSD license) and its code, online documentation and video tutorials are available on TTK's website. 
### 701.Learning towards Minimum Hyperspherical Energy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09298.pdf)
> Neural networks are a powerful class of nonlinear functions that can be trained end-to-end on various applications. While the over-parametrization nature in many neural networks renders the ability to fit complex functions and the strong representation power to handle challenging tasks, it also leads to highly correlated neurons that can hurt the generalization ability and incur unnecessary computation cost. As a result, how to regularize the network to avoid undesired representation redundancy becomes an important issue. To this end, we draw inspiration from a well-known problem in physics -- Thomson problem, where one seeks to find a state that distributes N electrons on a unit sphere as even as possible with minimum potential energy. In light of this intuition, we reduce the redundancy regularization problem to generic energy minimization, and propose a minimum hyperspherical energy (MHE) objective as generic regularization for neural networks. We also propose a few novel variants of MHE, and provide some insights from a theoretical point of view. Finally, we apply networks with MHE regularization to several challenging tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, by showing the superior performance with MHE regularization. 
### 702.Backpropagation with N-D Vector-Valued Neurons Using Arbitrary Bilinear  Products [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09621.pdf)
> Vector-valued neural learning has emerged as a promising direction in deep learning recently. Traditionally, training data for neural networks (NNs) are formulated as a vector of scalars; however, its performance may not be optimal since associations among adjacent scalars are not modeled. In this paper, we propose a new vector neural architecture called the Arbitrary BIlinear Product Neural Network (ABIPNN), which processes information as vectors in each neuron, and the feedforward projections are defined using arbitrary bilinear products. Such bilinear products can include circular convolution, seven-dimensional vector product, skew circular convolution, reversed- time circular convolution, or other new products not seen in previous work. As a proof-of-concept, we apply our proposed network to multispectral image denoising and singing voice sepa- ration. Experimental results show that ABIPNN gains substantial improvements when compared to conventional NNs, suggesting that associations are learned during training. 
### 703.Corpus Conversion Service: A machine learning platform to ingest  documents at scale [Poster abstract] [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09687.pdf)
> Over the past few decades, the amount of scientific articles and technical literature has increased exponentially in size. Consequently, there is a great need for systems that can ingest these documents at scale and make their content discoverable. Unfortunately, both the format of these documents (e.g. the PDF format or bitmap images) as well as the presentation of the data (e.g. complex tables) make the extraction of qualitative and quantitive data extremely challenging. We present a platform to ingest documents at scale which is powered by Machine Learning techniques and allows the user to train custom models on document collections. We show precision/recall results greater than 97% with regard to conversion to structured formats, as well as scaling evidence for each of the microservices constituting the platform. 
### 704.Multi-Task Zipping via Layer-wise Neuron Sharing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09791.pdf)
> Future mobile devices are anticipated to perceive, understand and react to the world on their own by running multiple correlated deep neural networks on-device. Yet the complexity of these neural networks needs to be trimmed down both withinmodel and cross-model to fit in mobile storage and memory. Previous studies focus on squeezing the redundancy within a single neural network. In this work, we aim to reduce the redundancy across multiple models. We propose Multi-Task Zipping (MTZ), a framework to automatically merge correlated, pre-trained deep neural networks for cross-model compression. Central in MTZ is a layer-wise neuron sharing and incoming weight updating scheme that induces a minimal change in the error function. MTZ inherits information from each model and demands light retraining to re-boost the accuracy of individual tasks. Evaluations show that MTZ is able to fully merge the hidden layers of two VGG-16 networks with a 3.18% increase in the test error averaged on ImageNet and CelebA, or share 39.61% parameters between the two networks with &lt; 0.5% increase in the test errors for both tasks. The number of iterations to retrain the combined network is at least 17.8x lower than that of training a single VGG-16 network. 
### 705.Transductive Propagation Network for Few-shot Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10002.pdf)
> Few-shot learning aims to build a learner that quickly generalizes to novel classes even when a limited number of labeled examples (so-called low-data problem) are available. Meta-learning is commonly deployed to mimic the test environment in a training phase for good generalization, where episodes (i.e., learning problems) are manually constructed from the training set. This framework gains a lot of attention to few-shot learning with impressive performance, though the low-data problem is not fully addressed. In this paper, we propose Transductive Propagation Network (TPN), a transductive method that classifies the entire test set at once to alleviate the low-data problem. Specifically, our proposed network explicitly learns an underlying manifold space that is appropriate to propagate labels from few-shot examples, where all parameters of feature embedding, manifold structure, and label propagation are estimated in an end-to-end way on episodes. We evaluate the proposed method on the commonly used miniImageNet and tieredImageNet benchmarks and achieve the state-of-the-art or promising results on these datasets. 
### 706.TADAM: Task dependent adaptive metric for improved few-shot learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10123.pdf)
> Few-shot learning has become essential for producing models that generalize from few examples. In this work, we identify that metric scaling and metric task conditioning are important to improve the performance of few-shot algorithms. Our analysis reveals that simple metric scaling completely changes the nature of few-shot algorithm parameter updates. Metric scaling provides improvements up to 14% in accuracy for certain metrics on the mini-Imagenet 5-way 5-shot classification task. We further propose a simple and effective way of conditioning a learner on the task sample set, resulting in learning a task-dependent metric space. Moreover, we propose and empirically test a practical end-to-end optimization procedure based on auxiliary task co-training to learn a task-dependent metric space. The resulting few-shot learning model based on the task-dependent scaled metric achieves state of the art on mini-Imagenet. We confirm these results on another few-shot dataset that we introduce in this paper based on CIFAR100. 
### 707.Dyna Planning using a Feature Based Generative Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10129.pdf)
> Dyna-style reinforcement learning is a powerful approach for problems where not much real data is available. The main idea is to supplement real trajectories, or sequences of sampled states over time, with simulated ones sampled from a learned model of the environment. However, in large state spaces, the problem of learning a good generative model of the environment has been open so far. We propose to use deep belief networks to learn an environment model for use in Dyna. We present our approach and validate it empirically on problems where the state observations consist of images. Our results demonstrate that using deep belief networks, which are full generative models, significantly outperforms the use of linear expectation models, proposed in Sutton et al. (2008) 
### 708.Cross Domain Image Generation through Latent Space Exploration with  Adversarial Loss [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10130.pdf)
> Conditional domain generation is a good way to interactively control sample generation process of deep generative models. However, once a conditional generative model has been created, it is often expensive to allow it to adapt to new conditional controls, especially the network structure is relatively deep. We propose a conditioned latent domain transfer framework across latent spaces of unconditional variational autoencoders(VAE). With this framework, we can allow unconditionally trained VAEs to generate images in its domain with conditionals provided by a latent representation of another domain. This framework does not assume commonalities between two domains. We demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of our model under widely used image datasets. 
### 709.Global Geometry of Multichannel Sparse Blind Deconvolution on the Sphere [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10437.pdf)
> Multichannel blind deconvolution is the problem of recovering an unknown signal $f$ and multiple unknown channels $x_i$ from convolutional measurements $y_i=x_i \circledast f$ ($i=1,2,\dots,N$). We consider the case where the $x_i$'s are sparse, and convolution with $f$ is invertible. Our nonconvex optimization formulation solves for a filter $h$ on the unit sphere that produces sparse output $y_i\circledast h$. Under some technical assumptions, we show that all local minima of the objective function correspond to the inverse filter of $f$ up to an inherent sign and shift ambiguity, and all saddle points have strictly negative curvatures. This geometric structure allows successful recovery of $f$ and $x_i$ using a simple manifold gradient descent algorithm with random initialization. Our theoretical findings are complemented by numerical experiments, which demonstrate superior performance of the proposed approach over the previous methods. 
### 710.Adversarial Constraint Learning for Structured Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10561.pdf)
> Constraint-based learning reduces the burden of collecting labels by having users specify general properties of structured outputs, such as constraints imposed by physical laws. We propose a novel framework for simultaneously learning these constraints and using them for supervision, bypassing the difficulty of using domain expertise to manually specify constraints. Learning requires a black-box simulator of structured outputs, which generates valid labels, but need not model their corresponding inputs or the input-label relationship. At training time, we constrain the model to produce outputs that cannot be distinguished from simulated labels by adversarial training. Providing our framework with a small number of labeled inputs gives rise to a new semi-supervised structured prediction model; we evaluate this model on multiple tasks --- tracking, pose estimation and time series prediction --- and find that it achieves high accuracy with only a small number of labeled inputs. In some cases, no labels are required at all. 
### 711.Adversarial Deformation Regularization for Training Image Registration  Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10665.pdf)
> We describe an adversarial learning approach to constrain convolutional neural network training for image registration, replacing heuristic smoothness measures of displacement fields often used in these tasks. Using minimally-invasive prostate cancer intervention as an example application, we demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing biomechanical simulations to regularize a weakly-supervised anatomical-label-driven registration network for aligning pre-procedural magnetic resonance (MR) and 3D intra-procedural transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images. A discriminator network is optimized to distinguish the registration-predicted displacement fields from the motion data simulated by finite element analysis. During training, the registration network simultaneously aims to maximize similarity between anatomical labels that drives image alignment and to minimize an adversarial generator loss that measures divergence between the predicted- and simulated deformation. The end-to-end trained network enables efficient and fully-automated registration that only requires an MR and TRUS image pair as input, without anatomical labels or simulated data during inference. 108 pairs of labelled MR and TRUS images from 76 prostate cancer patients and 71,500 nonlinear finite-element simulations from 143 different patients were used for this study. We show that, with only gland segmentation as training labels, the proposed method can help predict physically plausible deformation without any other smoothness penalty. Based on cross-validation experiments using 834 pairs of independent validation landmarks, the proposed adversarial-regularized registration achieved a target registration error of 6.3 mm that is significantly lower than those from several other regularization methods. 
### 712.Parallel Weight Consolidation: A Brain Segmentation Case Study [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10863.pdf)
> Collecting the large datasets needed to train deep neural networks can be very difficult, particularly for the many applications for which sharing and pooling data is complicated by practical, ethical, or legal concerns. However, it may be the case that derivative datasets or predictive models developed within individual sites can be shared and combined with fewer restrictions. Training on distributed datasets and combining the resulting networks is often viewed as continual learning, but these methods require networks to be trained sequentially. In this paper, we introduce parallel weight consolidation (PWC), a continual learning method to consolidate the weights of neural networks trained in parallel on independent datasets. We perform a brain segmentation case study using PWC to consolidate several dilated convolutional neural networks trained in parallel on independent structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) datasets from different sites. We found that PWC led to increased performance on held-out test sets from the different sites, as well as on a very large and completely independent multi-site dataset. This demonstrates the feasibility of PWC for combining the knowledge learned by networks trained on different datasets. 
### 713.GLAC Net: GLocal Attention Cascading Networks for Multi-image Cued Story  Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10973.pdf)
> The task of multi-image cued story generation, such as visual storytelling dataset (VIST) challenge, is to compose multiple coherent sentences from a given sequence of images. The main difficulty is how to generate image-specific sentences within the context of overall images. Here we propose a deep learning network model, GLAC Net, that generates visual stories by combining global-local (glocal) attention and context cascading mechanisms. The model incorporates two levels of attention, i.e., overall encoding level and image feature level, to construct image-dependent sentences. While standard attention configuration needs a large number of parameters, the GLAC Net implements them in a very simple way via hard connections from the outputs of encoders or image features onto the sentence generators. The coherency of the generated story is further improved by conveying (cascading) the information of the previous sentence to the next sentence serially. We evaluate the performance of the GLAC Net on the visual storytelling dataset (VIST) and achieve very competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. 
### 714.Long-term Large-scale Mapping and Localization Using maplab [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10994.pdf)
> This paper discusses a large-scale and long-term mapping and localization scenario using the maplab open-source framework. We present a brief overview of the specific algorithms in the system that enable building a consistent map from multiple sessions. We then demonstrate that such a map can be reused even a few months later for efficient 6-DoF localization and also new trajectories can be registered within the existing 3D model. The datasets presented in this paper are made publicly available. 
### 715.GenAttack: Practical Black-box Attacks with Gradient-Free Optimization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11090.pdf)
> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, even in the black-box case, where the attacker is limited to solely query access. Existing blackbox approaches to generating adversarial examples typically require a significant amount of queries, either for training a substitute network or estimating gradients from the output scores. We introduce GenAttack, a gradient-free optimization technique which uses genetic algorithms for synthesizing adversarial examples in the black-box setting. Our experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets show that GenAttack can successfully generate visually imperceptible adversarial examples against state-of-the-art image recognition models with orders of magnitude fewer queries than existing approaches. For example, in our CIFAR-10 experiments, GenAttack required roughly 2,568 times less queries than the current state-of-the-art black-box attack. Furthermore, we show that GenAttack can successfully attack both the state-of-the-art ImageNet defense, ensemble adversarial training, and non-differentiable, randomized input transformation defenses. GenAttack's success against ensemble adversarial training demonstrates that its query efficiency enables it to exploit the defense's weakness to direct black-box attacks. GenAttack's success against non-differentiable input transformations indicates that its gradient-free nature enables it to be applicable against defenses which perform gradient masking/obfuscation to confuse the attacker. Our results suggest that population-based optimization opens up a promising area of research into effective gradient-free black-box attacks. 
### 716.CNN-Based Detection of Generic Constrast Adjustment with JPEG  Post-processing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11318.pdf)
> Detection of contrast adjustments in the presence of JPEG postprocessing is known to be a challenging task. JPEG post processing is often applied innocently, as JPEG is the most common image format, or it may correspond to a laundering attack, when it is purposely applied to erase the traces of manipulation. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based detector for generic contrast adjustment, which is robust to JPEG compression. The proposed system relies on a patch-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained to distinguish pristine images from contrast adjusted images, for some selected adjustment operators of different nature. Robustness to JPEG compression is achieved by training the CNN with JPEG examples, compressed over a range of Quality Factors (QFs). Experimental results show that the detector works very well and scales well with respect to the adjustment type, yielding very good performance under a large variety of unseen tonal adjustments. 
### 717.Playing hard exploration games by watching YouTube [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11592.pdf)
> Deep reinforcement learning methods traditionally struggle with tasks where environment rewards are particularly sparse. One successful method of guiding exploration in these domains is to imitate trajectories provided by a human demonstrator. However, these demonstrations are typically collected under artificial conditions, i.e. with access to the agent's exact environment setup and the demonstrator's action and reward trajectories. Here we propose a two-stage method that overcomes these limitations by relying on noisy, unaligned footage without access to such data. First, we learn to map unaligned videos from multiple sources to a common representation using self-supervised objectives constructed over both time and modality (i.e. vision and sound). Second, we embed a single YouTube video in this representation to construct a reward function that encourages an agent to imitate human gameplay. This method of one-shot imitation allows our agent to convincingly exceed human-level performance on the infamously hard exploration games Montezuma's Revenge, Pitfall! and Private Eye for the first time, even if the agent is not presented with any environment rewards. 
### 718.A Novel Multi-clustering Method for Hierarchical Clusterings, Based on  Boosting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11712.pdf)
> Bagging and boosting are proved to be the best methods of building multiple classifiers in classification combination problems. In the area of "flat clustering" problems, it is also recognized that multi-clustering methods based on boosting provide clusterings of an improved quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-clustering method for "hierarchical clusterings" based on boosting theory, which creates a more stable hierarchical clustering of a dataset. The proposed algorithm includes a boosting iteration in which a bootstrap of samples is created by weighted random sampling of elements from the original dataset. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is then applied to selected subsample to build a dendrogram which describes the hierarchy. Finally, dissimilarity description matrices of multiple dendrogram results are combined to a consensus one, using a hierarchical-clustering-combination approach. Experiments on real popular datasets show that boosted method provides superior quality solutions compared to standard hierarchical clustering methods. 
### 719.Autonomous Vehicles that Interact with Pedestrians: A Survey of Theory  and Practice [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11773.pdf)
> One of the major challenges that autonomous cars are facing today is driving in urban environments. To make it a reality, autonomous vehicles require the ability to communicate with other road users and understand their intentions. Such interactions are essential between the vehicles and pedestrians as the most vulnerable road users. Understanding pedestrian behavior, however, is not intuitive and depends on various factors such as demographics of the pedestrians, traffic dynamics, environmental conditions, etc. In this paper, we identify these factors by surveying pedestrian behavior studies, both the classical works on pedestrian-driver interaction and the modern ones that involve autonomous vehicles. To this end, we will discuss various methods of studying pedestrian behavior, and analyze how the factors identified in the literature are interrelated. We will also review the practical applications aimed at solving the interaction problem including design approaches for autonomous vehicles that communicate with pedestrians and visual perception and reasoning algorithms tailored to understanding pedestrian intention. Based on our findings, we will discuss the open problems and propose future research directions. 
### 720.Grow and Prune Compact, Fast, and Accurate LSTMs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11797.pdf)
> Long short-term memory (LSTM) has been widely used for sequential data modeling. Researchers have increased LSTM depth by stacking LSTM cells to improve performance. This incurs model redundancy, increases run-time delay, and makes the LSTMs more prone to overfitting. To address these problems, we propose a hidden-layer LSTM (H-LSTM) that adds hidden layers to LSTM's original one level non-linear control gates. H-LSTM increases accuracy while employing fewer external stacked layers, thus reducing the number of parameters and run-time latency significantly. We employ grow-and-prune (GP) training to iteratively adjust the hidden layers through gradient-based growth and magnitude-based pruning of connections. This learns both the weights and the compact architecture of H-LSTM control gates. We have GP-trained H-LSTMs for image captioning and speech recognition applications. For the NeuralTalk architecture on the MSCOCO dataset, our three models reduce the number of parameters by 38.7x [floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 45.5x], run-time latency by 4.5x, and improve the CIDEr score by 2.6. For the DeepSpeech2 architecture on the AN4 dataset, our two models reduce the number of parameters by 19.4x (FLOPs by 23.5x), run-time latency by 15.7%, and the word error rate from 12.9% to 8.7%. Thus, GP-trained H-LSTMs can be seen to be compact, fast, and accurate. 
### 721.Visual Referring Expression Recognition: What Do Systems Actually Learn? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11818.pdf)
> We present an empirical analysis of the state-of-the-art systems for referring expression recognition -- the task of identifying the object in an image referred to by a natural language expression -- with the goal of gaining insight into how these systems reason about language and vision. Surprisingly, we find strong evidence that even sophisticated and linguistically-motivated models for this task may ignore the linguistic structure, instead relying on shallow correlations introduced by unintended biases in the data selection and annotation process. For example, we show that a system trained and tested on the input image $\textit{without the input referring expression}$ can achieve a precision of 71.2% in top-2 predictions. Furthermore, a system that predicts only the object category given the input can achieve a precision of 84.2% in top-2 predictions. These surprisingly positive results for what should be deficient prediction scenarios suggest that careful analysis of what our models are learning -- and further, how our data is constructed -- is critical as we seek to make substantive progress on grounded language tasks. 
### 722.Automatic generation of object shapes with desired functionalities [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11984.pdf)
> Functional design of objects is slow and still largely an artisanal activity, with few Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools existing to aid the exploration of the design solution space. In order to accelerate object design, we introduce an automatic method for generating object shapes with desired functionalities. We employ the concept of shape arithmetic, where shapes are manipulated in an arithmetic fashion inside a latent space representation learned by a neural network. We propose a functionality arithmetic, with the aim of conceiving new objects with desired functionalities from other objects with known functionalities. This is done by first extracting the descriptions of forms providing these functionalities, and then manipulating them using shape arithmetic functions. Form-to-function mappings are extracted by identifying the common features between objects belonging to the same class, inside which all objects provide the same functionality. 
### 723.Privacy Aware Offloading of Deep Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12024.pdf)
> Deep neural networks require large amounts of resources which makes them hard to use on resource constrained devices such as Internet-of-things devices. Offloading the computations to the cloud can circumvent these constraints but introduces a privacy risk since the operator of the cloud is not necessarily trustworthy. We propose a technique that obfuscates the data before sending it to the remote computation node. The obfuscated data is unintelligible for a human eavesdropper but can still be classified with a high accuracy by a neural network trained on unobfuscated images. 
### 724.Robust Place Categorization with Deep Domain Generalization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12048.pdf)
> Traditional place categorization approaches in robot vision assume that training and test images have similar visual appearance. Therefore, any seasonal, illumination and environmental changes typically lead to severe degradation in performance. To cope with this problem, recent works have proposed to adopt domain adaptation techniques. While effective, these methods assume that some prior information about the scenario where the robot will operate is available at training time. Unfortunately, in many cases this assumption does not hold, as we often do not know where a robot will be deployed. To overcome this issue, in this paper we present an approach which aims at learning classification models able to generalize to unseen scenarios. Specifically, we propose a novel deep learning framework for domain generalization. Our method develops from the intuition that, given a set of different classification models associated to known domains (e.g. corresponding to multiple environments, robots), the best model for a new sample in the novel domain can be computed directly at test time by optimally combining the known models. To implement our idea, we exploit recent advances in deep domain adaptation and design a Convolutional Neural Network architecture with novel layers performing a weighted version of Batch Normalization. Our experiments, conducted on three common datasets for robot place categorization, confirm the validity of our contribution. 
### 725.Context Exploitation using Hierarchical Bayesian Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12183.pdf)
> We consider the problem of how to improve automatic target recognition by fusing the naive sensor-level classification decisions with "intuition," or context, in a mathematically principled way. This is a general approach that is compatible with many definitions of context, but for specificity, we consider context as co-occurrence in imagery. In particular, we consider images that contain multiple objects identified at various confidence levels. We learn the patterns of co-occurrence in each context, then use these patterns as hyper-parameters for a Hierarchical Bayesian Model. The result is that low-confidence sensor classification decisions can be dramatically improved by fusing those readings with context. We further use hyperpriors to address the case where multiple contexts may be appropriate. We also consider the Bayesian Network, an alternative to the Hierarchical Bayesian Model, which is computationally more efficient but assumes that context and sensor readings are uncorrelated. 
### 726.Reinforced Continual Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12369.pdf)
> Most artificial intelligence models have limiting ability to solve new tasks faster, without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The recently emerging paradigm of continual learning aims to solve this issue, in which the model learns various tasks in a sequential fashion. In this work, a novel approach for continual learning is proposed, which searches for the best neural architecture for each coming task via sophisticatedly designed reinforcement learning strategies. We name it as Reinforced Continual Learning. Our method not only has good performance on preventing catastrophic forgetting but also fits new tasks well. The experiments on sequential classification tasks for variants of MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing continual learning alternatives for deep networks. 
### 727.Sequential Attacks on Agents for Long-Term Adversarial Goals [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12487.pdf)
> Reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced greatly in the past few years with the employment of effective deep neural networks (DNNs) on the policy networks. With the great effectiveness came serious vulnerability issues with DNNs that small adversarial perturbations on the input can change the output of the network. Several works have pointed out that learned agents with a DNN policy network can be manipulated against achieving the original task through a sequence of small perturbations on the input states. In this paper, we demonstrate furthermore that it is also possible to impose an arbitrary adversarial reward on the victim policy network through a sequence of attacks. Our method involves the latest adversarial attack technique, Adversarial Transformer Network (ATN), that learns to generate the attack and is easy to integrate into the policy network. As a result of our attack, the victim agent is misguided to optimise for the adversarial reward over time. Our results expose serious security threats for RL applications in safety-critical systems including drones, medical analysis, and self-driving cars. 
### 728.Channel Gating Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12549.pdf)
> Employing deep neural networks to obtain state-of-the-art performance on computer vision tasks can consume billions of floating point operations and several Joules of energy per evaluation. Network pruning, which statically removes unnecessary features and weights, has emerged as a promising way to reduce this computation cost. In this paper, we propose channel gating, a dynamic, fine-grained, training-based computation-cost-reduction scheme. Channel gating works by identifying the regions in the features which contribute less to the classification result and turning off a subset of the channels for computing the pixels within these uninteresting regions. Unlike static network pruning, the channel gating optimizes computations exploiting characteristics specific to each input at run-time. We show experimentally that applying channel gating in state-of-the-art networks can achieve 66% and 60% reduction in FLOPs with 0.22% and 0.29% accuracy loss on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively. 
### 729.Versatile Auxiliary Classifier with Generative Adversarial Network  (VAC+GAN) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00316.pdf)
> One of the most interesting challenges in Artificial Intelligence is to train conditional generators which are able to provide labeled adversarial samples drawn from a specific distribution. In this work, a new framework is presented to train a deep conditional generator by placing a classifier in parallel with the discriminator and back propagate the classification error through the generator network. The method is versatile and is applicable to any variations of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) implementation, and also gives superior results compared to similar methods. 
### 730.Multimodal Utterance-level Affect Analysis using Visual, Audio and Text  Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00625.pdf)
> The integration of information across multiple modalities and across time is a promising way to enhance the emotion recognition performance of affective systems. Much previous work has focused on instantaneous emotion recognition. The 2018 One-Minute Gradual-Emotion Recognition (OMG-Emotion) challenge, which was held in conjunction with the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence, encouraged participants to address long-term emotion recognition by integrating cues from multiple modalities, including facial expression, audio and language. Intuitively, a multi-modal inference network should be able to leverage information from each modality and their correlations to improve recognition over that achievable by a single modality network. We describe here a multi-modal neural architecture that integrates visual information over time using an LSTM, and combines it with utterance level audio and text cues to recognize human sentiment from multimodal clips. Our model outperforms the unimodal baseline, achieving the concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of 0.400 on the arousal task, and 0.353 on the valence task. 
### 731.A Numerical Framework for Efficient Motion Estimation on Evolving  Sphere-Like Surfaces based on Brightness and Mass Conservation Laws [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01006.pdf)
> In this work we consider brightness and mass conservation laws for motion estimation on evolving Riemannian 2-manifolds that allow for a radial parametrisation from the 2-sphere. While conservation of brightness constitutes the foundation for optical flow methods and has been generalised to said scenario, we formulate in this article the principle of mass conservation for time-varying surfaces which are embedded in Euclidean 3-space and derive a generalised continuity equation. The main motivation for this work is efficient cell motion estimation in time-lapse (4D) volumetric fluorescence microscopy images of a living zebrafish embryo. Increasing spatial and temporal resolution of modern microscopes require efficient analysis of such data. With this application in mind we address this need and follow an emerging paradigm in this field: dimensional reduction. In light of the ill-posedness of considered conservation laws we employ Tikhonov regularisation and propose the use of spatially varying regularisation functionals that recover motion only in regions with cells. For the efficient numerical solution we devise a Galerkin method based on compactly supported (tangent) vectorial basis functions. Furthermore, for the fast and accurate estimation of the evolving sphere-like surface from scattered data we utilise surface interpolation with spatio-temporal regularisation. We present numerical results based on aforementioned zebrafish microscopy data featuring fluorescently labelled cells. 
### 732.Learning-Based Compressive MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01266.pdf)
> In the area of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an extensive range of non-linear reconstruction algorithms have been proposed that can be used with general Fourier subsampling patterns. However, the design of these subsampling patterns has typically been considered in isolation from the reconstruction rule and the anatomy under consideration. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework for optimizing MRI subsampling patterns for a specific reconstruction rule and anatomy, considering both the noiseless and noisy settings. Our learning algorithm has access to a representative set of training signals, and searches for a sampling pattern that performs well on average for the signals in this set. We present a novel parameter-free greedy mask selection method, and show it to be effective for a variety of reconstruction rules and performance metrics. Moreover we also support our numerical findings by providing a rigorous justification of our framework via statistical learning theory. 
### 733.SdcNet: A Computation-Efficient CNN for Object Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01317.pdf)
> Extracting features from a huge amount of data for object recognition is a challenging task. Convolution neural network can be used to meet the challenge, but it often requires a large number of computation resources. In this paper, a computation-efficient convolutional module, named SdcBlock, is proposed and based on it, the convolution network SdcNet is introduced for object recognition tasks. In the proposed module, optimized successive depthwise convolutions supported by appropriate data management is applied in order to generate vectors containing high density and more varieties of feature information. The hyperparameters can be easily adjusted to suit varieties of tasks under different computation restrictions without significantly jeopardizing the performance. The experiments have shown that SdcNet achieved an error rate of 5.60% in CIFAR-10 with only 55M Flops and also reduced further the error rate to 5.24% using a moderate volume of 103M Flops. The expected computation efficiency of the SdcNet has been confirmed. 
### 734.Joint Cell Nuclei Detection and Segmentation in Microscopy Images Using  3D Convolutional Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02850.pdf)
> We propose a 3D convolutional neural network to simultaneously segment and detect cell nuclei in confocal microscopy images. Mirroring the co-dependency of these tasks, our proposed model consists of two serial components: the first part computes a segmentation of cell bodies, while the second module identifies the centers of these cells. Our model is trained end-to-end from scratch on a mouse parotid salivary gland stem cell nuclei dataset comprising 107 image stacks from three independent cell preparations, each containing several hundred individual cell nuclei in 3D. In our experiments, we conduct a thorough evaluation of both detection accuracy and segmentation quality, on two different datasets. The results show that the proposed method provides significantly improved detection and segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art and benchmark algorithms. Finally, we use a previously described test-time drop-out strategy to obtain uncertainty estimates on our predictions and validate these estimates by demonstrating that they are strongly correlated with accuracy. 
### 735.Comparing heterogeneous visual gestures for measuring the diversity of  visual speech signals [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02948.pdf)
> Visual lip gestures observed whilst lipreading have a few working definitions, the most common two are; `the visual equivalent of a phoneme' and `phonemes which are indistinguishable on the lips'. To date there is no formal definition, in part because to date we have not established a two-way relationship or mapping between visemes and phonemes. Some evidence suggests that visual speech is highly dependent upon the speaker. So here, we use a phoneme-clustering method to form new phoneme-to-viseme maps for both individual and multiple speakers. We test these phoneme to viseme maps to examine how similarly speakers talk visually and we use signed rank tests to measure the distance between individuals. We conclude that broadly speaking, speakers have the same repertoire of mouth gestures, where they differ is in the use of the gestures. 
### 736.A volumetric deep Convolutional Neural Network for simulation of dark  matter halo catalogues [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04537.pdf)
> For modern large-scale structure survey techniques it has become standard practice to test data analysis pipelines on large suites of mock simulations, a task which is currently prohibitively expensive for full N-body simulations. Instead of calculating this costly gravitational evolution, we have trained a three-dimensional deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify dark matter protohalos directly from the cosmological initial conditions. Training on halo catalogues from the Peak Patch semi-analytic code, we test various CNN architectures and find they generically achieve a Dice coefficient of ~92% in only 24 hours of training. We present a simple and fast geometric halo finding algorithm to extract halos from this powerful pixel-wise binary classifier and find that the predicted catalogues match the mass function and power spectra of the ground truth simulations to within ~10%. We investigate the effect of long-range tidal forces on an object-by-object basis and find that the network's predictions are consistent with the non-linear ellipsoidal collapse equations used explicitly by the Peak Patch algorithm. 
### 737.Image-derived generative modeling of pseudo-macromolecular structures -  towards the statistical assessment of Electron CryoTomography template  matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04634.pdf)
> Cellular Electron CryoTomography (CECT) is a 3D imaging technique that captures information about the structure and spatial organization of macromolecular complexes within single cells, in near-native state and at sub-molecular resolution. Although template matching is often used to locate macromolecules in a CECT image, it is insufficient as it only measures the relative structural similarity. Therefore, it is preferable to assess the statistical credibility of the decision through hypothesis testing, requiring many templates derived from a diverse population of macromolecular structures. Due to the very limited number of known structures, we need a generative model to efficiently and reliably sample pseudo-structures from the complex distribution of macromolecular structures. To address this challenge, we propose a novel image-derived approach for performing hypothesis testing for template matching by constructing generative models using the generative adversarial network. Finally, we conducted hypothesis testing experiments for template matching on both simulated and experimental subtomograms, allowing us to conclude the identity of subtomograms with high statistical credibility and significantly reducing false positives. 
### 738.Neural Multi-scale Image Compression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06386.pdf)
> This study presents a new lossy image compression method that utilizes the multi-scale features of natural images. Our model consists of two networks: multi-scale lossy autoencoder and parallel multi-scale lossless coder. The multi-scale lossy autoencoder extracts the multi-scale image features to quantized variables and the parallel multi-scale lossless coder enables rapid and accurate lossless coding of the quantized variables via encoding/decoding the variables in parallel. Our proposed model achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model on Kodak and RAISE-1k dataset images, and it encodes a PNG image of size $768 \times 512$ in 70 ms with a single GPU and a single CPU process and decodes it into a high-fidelity image in approximately 200 ms. 
### 739.Single Shot Active Learning using Pseudo Annotators [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06660.pdf)
> Standard myopic active learning assumes that human annotations are always obtainable whenever new samples are selected. This, however, is unrealistic in many real-world applications where human experts are not readily available at all times. In this paper, we consider the single shot setting: all the required samples should be chosen in a single shot and no human annotation can be exploited during the selection process. We propose a new method, Active Learning through Random Labeling (ALRL), which substitutes single human annotator for multiple, what we will refer to as, pseudo annotators. These pseudo annotators always provide uniform and random labels whenever new unlabeled samples are queried. This random labeling enables standard active learning algorithms to also exhibit the exploratory behavior needed for single shot active learning. The exploratory behavior is further enhanced by selecting the most representative sample via minimizing nearest neighbor distance between unlabeled samples and queried samples. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 740.Do Neural Network Cross-Modal Mappings Really Bridge Modalities? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07616.pdf)
> Feed-forward networks are widely used in cross-modal applications to bridge modalities by mapping distributed vectors of one modality to the other, or to a shared space. The predicted vectors are then used to perform e.g., retrieval or labeling. Thus, the success of the whole system relies on the ability of the mapping to make the neighborhood structure (i.e., the pairwise similarities) of the predicted vectors akin to that of the target vectors. However, whether this is achieved has not been investigated yet. Here, we propose a new similarity measure and two ad hoc experiments to shed light on this issue. In three cross-modal benchmarks we learn a large number of language-to-vision and vision-to-language neural network mappings (up to five layers) using a rich diversity of image and text features and loss functions. Our results reveal that, surprisingly, the neighborhood structure of the predicted vectors consistently resembles more that of the input vectors than that of the target vectors. In a second experiment, we further show that untrained nets do not significantly disrupt the neighborhood (i.e., semantic) structure of the input vectors. 
### 741.Conditional Inference in Pre-trained Variational Autoencoders via  Cross-coding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07785.pdf)
> Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a popular generative model, but one in which conditional inference can be challenging. If the decomposition into query and evidence variables is fixed, conditional VAEs provide an attractive solution. To support arbitrary queries, one is generally reduced to Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods that can suffer from long mixing times. In this paper, we propose an idea we term cross-coding to approximate the distribution over the latent variables after conditioning on an evidence assignment to some subset of the variables. This allows generating query samples without retraining the full VAE. We experimentally evaluate three variations of cross-coding showing that (i) two can be quickly trained for different decompositions of evidence and query and (ii) they quantitatively and qualitatively outperform Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. 
### 742.How Many Samples are Needed to Learn a Convolutional Neural Network? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07883.pdf)
> A widespread folklore for explaining the success of convolutional neural network (CNN) is that CNN is a more compact representation than the fully connected neural network (FNN) and thus requires fewer samples for learning. We initiate the study of rigorously characterizing the sample complexity of learning convolutional neural networks. We show that for learning an $m$-dimensional convolutional filter with linear activation acting on a $d$-dimensional input, the sample complexity of achieving population prediction error of $\epsilon$ is $\widetilde{O} (m/\epsilon^2)$, whereas its FNN counterpart needs at least $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ samples. Since $m \ll d$, this result demonstrates the advantage of using CNN. We further consider the sample complexity of learning a one-hidden-layer CNN with linear activation where both the $m$-dimensional convolutional filter and the $r$-dimensional output weights are unknown. For this model, we show the sample complexity is $\widetilde{O}\left((m+r)/\epsilon^2\right)$ when the ratio between the stride size and the filter size is a constant. For both models, we also present lower bounds showing our sample complexities are tight up to logarithmic factors. Our main tools for deriving these results are localized empirical process and a new lemma characterizing the convolutional structure. We believe these tools may inspire further developments in understanding CNN. 
### 743.A Nonconvex Projection Method for Robust PCA [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07962.pdf)
> Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) is a well-studied problem with the goal of decomposing a matrix into the sum of low-rank and sparse components. In this paper, we propose a nonconvex feasibility reformulation of RPCA problem and apply an alternating projection method to solve it. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a method that solves RPCA problem without considering any objective function, convex relaxation, or surrogate convex constraints. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments on a variety of applications, including shadow removal, background estimation, face detection, and galaxy evolution, that our approach matches and often significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art in various ways. 
### 744.Graph Capsule Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08090.pdf)
> Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) are the most recent exciting advancement in deep learning field and their applications are quickly spreading in multi-cross-domains including bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, social networks, natural language processing and computer vision. In this paper, we expose and tackle some of the basic weaknesses of a GCNN model with a capsule idea presented in \cite{hinton2011transforming} and propose our Graph Capsule Network (GCAPS-CNN) model. In addition, we design our GCAPS-CNN model to solve especially graph classification problem which current GCNN models find challenging. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed Graph Capsule Network can significantly outperforms both the existing state-of-art deep learning methods and graph kernels on graph classification benchmark datasets. 
### 745.Reducing Parameter Space for Neural Network Training [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08340.pdf)
> For neural networks (NNs) with rectified linear unit (ReLU) or binary activation functions, we show that their training can be accomplished in a reduced parameter space. Specifically, the weights in each neuron can be trained on the unit sphere, as opposed to the entire space, and the threshold can be trained in a bounded interval, as opposed to the real line. We show that the NNs in the reduced parameter space are mathematically equivalent to the standard NNs with parameters in the whole space. The reduced parameter space shall facilitate the optimization procedure for the network training, as the search space becomes (much) smaller. We demonstrate the improved training performance using numerical examples. 
### 746.LMKL-Net: A Fast Localized Multiple Kernel Learning Solver via Deep  Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08656.pdf)
> In this paper we propose solving localized multiple kernel learning (LMKL) using LMKL-Net, a feedforward deep neural network. In contrast to previous works, as a learning principle we propose {\em parameterizing} both the gating function for learning kernel combination weights and the multiclass classifier in LMKL using an attentional network (AN) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP), respectively. In this way we can learn the (nonlinear) decision function in LMKL (approximately) by sequential applications of AN and MLP. Empirically on benchmark datasets we demonstrate that overall LMKL-Net can not only outperform the state-of-the-art MKL solvers in terms of accuracy, but also be trained about {\em two orders of magnitude} faster with much smaller memory footprint for large-scale learning. 
### 747.Deformable Part Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08808.pdf)
> In this paper we propose novel Deformable Part Networks (DPNs) to learn {\em pose-invariant} representations for 2D object recognition. In contrast to the state-of-the-art pose-aware networks such as CapsNet \cite{sabour2017dynamic} and STN \cite{jaderberg2015spatial}, DPNs can be naturally {\em interpreted} as an efficient solver for a challenging detection problem, namely Localized Deformable Part Models (LDPMs) where localization is introduced to DPMs as another latent variable for searching for the best poses of objects over all pixels and (predefined) scales. In particular we construct DPNs as sequences of such LDPM units to model the semantic and spatial relations among the deformable parts as hierarchical composition and spatial parsing trees. Empirically our 17-layer DPN can outperform both CapsNets and STNs significantly on affNIST \cite{sabour2017dynamic}, for instance, by 19.19\% and 12.75\%, respectively, with better generalization and better tolerance to affine transformations. 
### 748.Rapid seismic domain transfer: Seismic velocity inversion and modeling  using deep generative neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08826.pdf)
> Traditional physics-based approaches to infer sub-surface properties such as full-waveform inversion or reflectivity inversion are time-consuming and computationally expensive. We present a deep-learning technique that eliminates the need for these computationally complex methods by posing the problem as one of domain transfer. Our solution is based on a deep convolutional generative adversarial network and dramatically reduces computation time. Training based on two different types of synthetic data produced a neural network that generates realistic velocity models when applied to a real dataset. The system's ability to generalize means it is robust against the inherent occurrence of velocity errors and artifacts in both training and test datasets. 
### 749.Deep Barcodes for Fast Retrieval of Histopathology Scans [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08833.pdf)
> We investigate the concept of deep barcodes and propose two methods to generate them in order to expedite the process of classification and retrieval of histopathology images. Since binary search is computationally less expensive, in terms of both speed and storage, deep barcodes could be useful when dealing with big data retrieval. Our experiments use the dataset Kimia Path24 to test three pre-trained networks for image retrieval. The dataset consists of 27,055 training images in 24 different classes with large variability, and 1,325 test images for testing. Apart from the high-speed and efficiency, results show a surprising retrieval accuracy of 71.62% for deep barcodes, as compared to 68.91% for deep features and 68.53% for compressed deep features. 
### 750.Detection of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation using Attention-based  Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09133.pdf)
> Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), a type of cardiac arrhythmia, is difficult since many cases of AF are usually clinically silent and undiagnosed. In particular paroxysmal AF is a form of AF that occurs occasionally, and has a higher probability of being undetected. In this work, we present an attention based deep learning framework for detection of paroxysmal AF episodes from a sequence of windows. Time-frequency representation of 30 seconds recording windows, over a 10 minute data segment, are fed sequentially into a deep convolutional neural network for image-based feature extraction, which are then presented to a bidirectional recurrent neural network with an attention layer for AF detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for transient AF detection, we use a database of 24 hour Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings acquired from 2850 patients at the University of Virginia heart station. The algorithm achieves an AUC of 0.94 on the testing set, which exceeds the performance of baseline models. We also demonstrate the cross-domain generalizablity of the approach by adapting the learned model parameters from one recording modality (ECG) to another (photoplethysmogram) with improved AF detection performance. The proposed high accuracy, low false alarm algorithm for detecting paroxysmal AF has potential applications in long-term monitoring using wearable sensors. 
### 751.End-to-End Speech-Driven Facial Animation with Temporal GANs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09313.pdf)
> Speech-driven facial animation is the process which uses speech signals to automatically synthesize a talking character. The majority of work in this domain creates a mapping from audio features to visual features. This often requires post-processing using computer graphics techniques to produce realistic albeit subject dependent results. We present a system for generating videos of a talking head, using a still image of a person and an audio clip containing speech, that doesn't rely on any handcrafted intermediate features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method capable of generating subject independent realistic videos directly from raw audio. Our method can generate videos which have (a) lip movements that are in sync with the audio and (b) natural facial expressions such as blinks and eyebrow movements. We achieve this by using a temporal GAN with 2 discriminators, which are capable of capturing different aspects of the video. The effect of each component in our system is quantified through an ablation study. The generated videos are evaluated based on their sharpness, reconstruction quality, and lip-reading accuracy. Finally, a user study is conducted, confirming that temporal GANs lead to more natural sequences than a static GAN-based approach. 
### 752.Cautious Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09460.pdf)
> Most classifiers operate by selecting the maximum of an estimate of the conditional distribution $p(y|x)$ where $x$ stands for the features of the instance to be classified and $y$ denotes its label. This often results in a hubristic bias: overconfidence in the assignment of a definite label. Usually, the observations are concentrated on a small volume but the classifier provides definite predictions for the entire space. We propose constructing conformal prediction sets [vovk2005algorithmic] which contain a set of labels rather than a single label. These conformal prediction sets contain the true label with probability $1-\alpha$. Our construction is based on $p(x|y)$ rather than $p(y|x)$ which results in a classifier that is very cautious: it outputs the null set - meaning `I don't know' --- when the object does not resemble the training examples. An important property of our approach is that classes can be added or removed without having to retrain the classifier. We demonstrate the performance on the ImageNet ILSVRC dataset using high dimensional features obtained from state of the art convolutional neural networks. 
### 753.Prediction of Autism Treatment Response from Baseline fMRI using Random  Forests and Tree Bagging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09799.pdf)
> Treating children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with behavioral interventions, such as Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), has shown promise in recent studies. However, deciding which therapy is best for a given patient is largely by trial and error, and choosing an ineffective intervention results in loss of valuable treatment time. We propose predicting patient response to PRT from baseline task-based fMRI by the novel application of a random forest and tree bagging strategy. Our proposed learning pipeline uses random forest regression to determine candidate brain voxels that may be informative in predicting treatment response. The candidate voxels are then tested stepwise for inclusion in a bagged tree ensemble. After the predictive model is constructed, bias correction is performed to further increase prediction accuracy. Using data from 19 ASD children who underwent a 16 week trial of PRT and a leave-one-out cross-validation framework, the presented learning pipeline was tested against several standard methods and variations of the pipeline and resulted in the highest prediction accuracy. 
### 754.Three-Dimensional Radiotherapy Dose Prediction on Head and Neck Cancer  Patients with a Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net Deep Learning  Architecture [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10397.pdf)
> The treatment planning process for patients with head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer is regarded as one of the most complicated due large target volume, multiple prescription dose levels, and many radiation-sensitive critical structures near the target. Treatment planning for this site requires a high level of human expertise and a tremendous amount of effort to produce personalized high quality plans, taking as long as a week, which deteriorates the chances of tumor control and patient survival. To solve this problem, we propose to investigate a deep learning-based dose prediction model, Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net, based on two highly popular network architectures: U-net and DenseNet. We find that this new architecture is able to accurately and efficiently predict the dose distribution, outperforming the other two models, the Standard U-net and DenseNet, in homogeneity, dose conformity, and dose coverage on the test data. On average, our proposed model is capable of predicting the OAR max dose within 6.3% and mean dose within 5.1% of the prescription dose on the test data. The other models, the Standard U-net and DenseNet, performed worse, having an OAR max dose prediction error of 8.2% and 9.3%, respectively, and mean dose prediction error of 6.4% and 6.8%, respectively. In addition, our proposed model used 12 times less trainable parameters than the Standard U-net, and predicted the patient dose 4 times faster than DenseNet. 
### 755.Unsupervised Learning with Stein&#x27;s Unbiased Risk Estimator [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10531.pdf)
> Learning from unlabeled and noisy data is one of the grand challenges of machine learning. As such, it has seen a flurry of research with new ideas proposed continuously. In this work, we revisit a classical idea: Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE). We show that, in the context of image recovery, SURE and its generalizations can be used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for a range of image denoising and recovery problems {\em without any ground truth data.} <br />Specifically, our goal is to reconstruct an image $x$ from a {\em noisy} linear transformation (measurement) of the image. We consider two scenarios: one where no additional data is available and one where we have measurements of other images that are drawn from the same noisy distribution as $x$, but have no access to the clean images. Such is the case, for instance, in the context of medical imaging, microscopy, and astronomy, where noise-less ground truth data is rarely available. <br />We show that in this situation, SURE can be used to estimate the mean-squared-error loss associated with an estimate of $x$. Using this estimate of the loss, we train networks to perform denoising and compressed sensing recovery. In addition, we also use the SURE framework to partially explain and improve upon an intriguing results presented by Ulyanov et al. in "Deep Image Prior": that a network initialized with random weights and fit to a single noisy image can effectively denoise that image. 
### 756.A neural network trained to predict future video frames mimics critical  properties of biological neuronal responses and perception [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10734.pdf)
> While deep neural networks take loose inspiration from neuroscience, it is an open question how seriously to take the analogies between artificial deep networks and biological neuronal systems. Interestingly, recent work has shown that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale image recognition tasks can serve as strikingly good models for predicting the responses of neurons in visual cortex to visual stimuli, suggesting that analogies between artificial and biological neural networks may be more than superficial. However, while CNNs capture key properties of the average responses of cortical neurons, they fail to explain other properties of these neurons. For one, CNNs typically require large quantities of labeled input data for training. Our own brains, in contrast, rarely have access to this kind of supervision, so to the extent that representations are similar between CNNs and brains, this similarity must arise via different training paths. In addition, neurons in visual cortex produce complex time-varying responses even to static inputs, and they dynamically tune themselves to temporal regularities in the visual environment. We argue that these differences are clues to fundamental differences between the computations performed in the brain and in deep networks. To begin to close the gap, here we study the emergent properties of a previously-described recurrent generative network that is trained to predict future video frames in a self-supervised manner. Remarkably, the model is able to capture a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena observed in visual cortex, ranging from single unit response dynamics to complex perceptual motion illusions. These results suggest potentially deep connections between recurrent predictive neural network models and the brain, providing new leads that can enrich both fields. 
### 757.Versatile Auxiliary Regressor with Generative Adversarial network  (VAR+GAN) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10864.pdf)
> Being able to generate constrained samples is one of the most appealing applications of the deep generators. Conditional generators are one of the successful implementations of such models wherein the created samples are constrained to a specific class. In this work, the application of these networks is extended to regression problems wherein the conditional generator is restrained to any continuous aspect of the data. A new loss function is presented for the regression network and also implementations for generating faces with any particular set of landmarks is provided. 
### 758.Unsupervised Learning of Artistic Styles with Archetypal Style Analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11155.pdf)
> In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach to automatically discover, summarize, and manipulate artistic styles from large collections of paintings. Our method is based on archetypal analysis, which is an unsupervised learning technique akin to sparse coding with a geometric interpretation. When applied to deep image representations from a collection of artworks, it learns a dictionary of archetypal styles, which can be easily visualized. After training the model, the style of a new image, which is characterized by local statistics of deep visual features, is approximated by a sparse convex combination of archetypes. This enables us to interpret which archetypal styles are present in the input image, and in which proportion. Finally, our approach allows us to manipulate the coefficients of the latent archetypal decomposition, and achieve various special effects such as style enhancement, transfer, and interpolation between multiple archetypes. 
### 759.Can DNNs Learn to Lipread Full Sentences? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11685.pdf)
> Finding visual features and suitable models for lipreading tasks that are more complex than a well-constrained vocabulary has proven challenging. This paper explores state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network architectures for lipreading based on a Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Network. We report results for both hand-crafted and 2D/3D Convolutional Neural Network visual front-ends, online monotonic attention, and a joint Connectionist Temporal Classification-Sequence-to-Sequence loss. The system is evaluated on the publicly available TCD-TIMIT dataset, with 59 speakers and a vocabulary of over 6000 words. Results show a major improvement on a Hidden Markov Model framework. A fuller analysis of performance across visemes demonstrates that the network is not only learning the language model, but actually learning to lipread. 
### 760.Collaborative Learning for Deep Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11761.pdf)
> We introduce collaborative learning in which multiple classifier heads of the same network are simultaneously trained on the same training data to improve generalization and robustness to label noise with no extra inference cost. It acquires the strengths from auxiliary training, multi-task learning and knowledge distillation. There are two important mechanisms involved in collaborative learning. First, the consensus of multiple views from different classifier heads on the same example provides supplementary information as well as regularization to each classifier, thereby improving generalization. Second, intermediate-level representation (ILR) sharing with backpropagation rescaling aggregates the gradient flows from all heads, which not only reduces training computational complexity, but also facilitates supervision to the shared layers. The empirical results on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that deep neural networks learned as a group in a collaborative way significantly reduce the generalization error and increase the robustness to label noise. 
### 761.On Consensus-Optimality Trade-offs in Collaborative Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12120.pdf)
> In distributed machine learning, where agents collaboratively learn from diverse private data sets, there is a fundamental tension between consensus and optimality. In this paper, we build on recent algorithmic progresses in distributed deep learning to explore various consensus-optimality trade-offs over a fixed communication topology. First, we propose the incremental consensus-based distributed SGD (i-CDSGD) algorithm, which involves multiple consensus steps (where each agent communicates information with its neighbors) within each SGD iteration. Second, we propose the generalized consensus-based distributed SGD (g-CDSGD) algorithm that enables us to navigate the full spectrum from complete consensus (all agents agree) to complete disagreement (each agent converges to individual model parameters). We analytically establish convergence of the proposed algorithms for strongly convex and nonconvex objective functions; we also analyze the momentum variants of the algorithms for the strongly convex case. We support our algorithms via numerical experiments, and demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods for collaborative deep learning. 
### 762.There Is No Free Lunch In Adversarial Robustness (But There Are  Unexpected Benefits) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12152.pdf)
> We provide a new understanding of the fundamental nature of adversarially robust classifiers and how they differ from standard models. In particular, we show that there provably exists a trade-off between the standard accuracy of a model and its robustness to adversarial perturbations. We demonstrate an intriguing phenomenon at the root of this tension: a certain dichotomy between "robust" and "non-robust" features. We show that while robustness comes at a price, it also has some surprising benefits. Robust models turn out to have interpretable gradients and feature representations that align unusually well with salient data characteristics. In fact, they yield striking feature interpolations that have thus far been possible to obtain only using generative models such as GANs. 
### 763.Rotation Equivariance and Invariance in Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12301.pdf)
> Performance of neural networks can be significantly improved by encoding known invariance for particular tasks. Many image classification tasks, such as those related to cellular imaging, exhibit invariance to rotation. We present a novel scheme using the magnitude response of the 2D-discrete-Fourier transform (2D-DFT) to encode rotational invariance in neural networks, along with a new, efficient convolutional scheme for encoding rotational equivariance throughout convolutional layers. We implemented this scheme for several image classification tasks and demonstrated improved performance, in terms of classification accuracy, time required to train the model, and robustness to hyperparameter selection, over a standard CNN and another state-of-the-art method. 
### 764.Classification of volcanic ash particles using a convolutional neural  network and probability [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12353.pdf)
> Analyses of volcanic ash are typically performed either by qualitatively classifying ash particles by eye or by quantitatively parameterizing its shape and texture. While complex shapes can be classified through qualitative analyses, the results are subjective due to the difficulty of categorizing complex shapes into a single class. Although quantitative analyses are objective, selection of shape parameters is required. Here, we applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of volcanic ash. First, we defined four basal particle shapes (blocky, vesicular, elongated, rounded) generated by different eruption mechanisms (e.g., brittle fragmentation), and then trained the CNN using particles composed of only one basal shape. The CNN could recognize the basal shapes with over 90% accuracy. Using the trained network, we classified ash particles composed of multiple basal shapes based on the output of the network, which can be interpreted as a mixing ratio of the four basal shapes. Clustering of samples by the averaged probabilities and the intensity is consistent with the eruption type. The mixing ratio output by the CNN can be used to quantitatively classify complex shapes in nature without categorizing forcibly and without the need for shape parameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy. 
### 765.Whole Brain Susceptibility Mapping Using Harmonic Incompatibility  Removal [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12521.pdf)
> Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) uses the phase data in magnetic resonance signal to visualize a three dimensional susceptibility distribution by solving the magnetic field to susceptibility inverse problem. Due to the presence of zeros of the integration kernel in the frequency domain, QSM is an ill-posed inverse problem. Although numerous regularization based models have been proposed to overcome this problem, the incompatibility in the field data has not received enough attention, which leads to deterioration of the recovery. In this paper, we show that the data acquisition process of QSM inherently generates a harmonic incompatibility in the measured local field. Based on such discovery, we propose a novel regularization based susceptibility reconstruction model with an additional sparsity based regularization term on the harmonic incompatibility. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the existing approaches. 
### 766.Fully Automated Organ Segmentation in Male Pelvic CT Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12526.pdf)
> Accurate segmentation of prostate and surrounding organs at risk is important for prostate cancer radiotherapy treatment planning. We present a fully automated workflow for male pelvic CT image segmentation using deep learning. The architecture consists of a 2D localization network followed by a 3D segmentation network for volumetric segmentation of prostate, bladder, rectum, and femoral heads. We used a multi-channel 2D U-Net followed by a 3D U-Net with encoding arm modified with aggregated residual networks, known as ResNeXt. The models were trained and tested on a pelvic CT image dataset comprising 136 patients. Test results show that 3D U-Net based segmentation achieves mean (SD) Dice coefficient values of 90 (2.0)% ,96 (3.0)%, 95 (1.3)%, 95 (1.5)%, and 84 (3.7)% for prostate, left femoral head, right femoral head, bladder, and rectum, respectively, using the proposed fully automated segmentation method.
