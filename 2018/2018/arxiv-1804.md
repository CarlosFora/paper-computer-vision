### 1.Hierarchical Transfer Convolutional Neural Networks for Image  Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00021.pdf)
> In this paper, we address the issue of how to enhance the generalization performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in the early learning stage for image classification. This is motivated by real-time applications that require the generalization performance of CNN to be satisfactory within limited training time. In order to achieve this, a novel hierarchical transfer CNN framework is proposed. It consists of a group of shallow CNNs and a cloud CNN, where the shallow CNNs are trained firstly and then the first layers of the trained shallow CNNs are used to initialize the first layer of the cloud CNN. This method will boost the generalization performance of the cloud CNN significantly, especially during the early stage of training. Experiments using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets are performed to examine the proposed method. Results demonstrate the improvement of testing accuracy is 12% on average and as much as 20% for the CIFAR-10 case while 5% testing accuracy improvement for the ImageNet case during the early stage of learning. It is also shown that universal improvements of testing accuracy are obtained across different settings of dropout and number of shallow CNNs. 
### 2.Class Subset Selection for Transfer Learning using Submodularity [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00060.pdf)
> In recent years, it is common practice to extract fully-connected layer (fc) features that were learned while performing image classification on a source dataset, such as ImageNet, and apply them generally to a wide range of other tasks. The general usefulness of some large training datasets for transfer learning is not yet well understood, and raises a number of questions. For example, in the context of transfer learning, what is the role of a specific class in the source dataset, and how is the transferability of fc features affected when they are trained using various subsets of the set of all classes in the source dataset? In this paper, we address the question of how to select an optimal subset of the set of classes, subject to a budget constraint, that will more likely generate good features for other tasks. To accomplish this, we use a submodular set function to model the accuracy achievable on a new task when the features have been learned on a given subset of classes of the source dataset. An optimal subset is identified as the set that maximizes this submodular function. The maximization can be accomplished using an efficient greedy algorithm that comes with guarantees on the optimality of the solution. We empirically validate our submodular model by successfully identifying subsets of classes that produce good features for new tasks. 
### 3.Learning Beyond Human Expertise with Generative Models for Dental  Restorations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00064.pdf)
> Computer vision has advanced significantly that many discriminative approaches such as object recognition are now widely used in real applications. We present another exciting development that utilizes generative models for the mass customization of medical products such as dental crowns. In the dental industry, it takes a technician years of training to design synthetic crowns that restore the function and integrity of missing teeth. Each crown must be customized to individual patients, and it requires human expertise in a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, even with computer-assisted design software. We develop a fully automatic approach that learns not only from human designs of dental crowns, but also from natural spatial profiles between opposing teeth. The latter is hard to account for by technicians but important for proper biting and chewing functions. Built upon a Generative Adversar-ial Network architecture (GAN), our deep learning model predicts the customized crown-filled depth scan from the crown-missing depth scan and opposing depth scan. We propose to incorporate additional space constraints and statistical compatibility into learning. Our automatic designs exceed human technicians' standards for good morphology and functionality, and our algorithm is being tested for production use. 
### 4.FloorNet: A Unified Framework for Floorplan Reconstruction from 3D Scans [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00090.pdf)
> The ultimate goal of this indoor mapping research is to automatically reconstruct a floorplan simply by walking through a house with a smartphone in a pocket. This paper tackles this problem by proposing FloorNet, a novel deep neural architecture. The challenge lies in the processing of RGBD streams spanning a large 3D space. FloorNet effectively processes the data through three neural network branches: 1) PointNet with 3D points, exploiting the 3D information; 2) CNN with a 2D point density image in a top-down view, enhancing the local spatial reasoning; and 3) CNN with RGB images, utilizing the full image information. FloorNet exchanges intermediate features across the branches to exploit the best of all the architectures. We have created a benchmark for floorplan reconstruction by acquiring RGBD video streams for 155 residential houses or apartments with Google Tango phones and annotating complete floorplan information. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the fusion of three branches effectively improves the reconstruction quality. We hope that the paper together with the benchmark will be an important step towards solving a challenging vector-graphics reconstruction problem. Code and data are available at <a href="https://github.com/art-programmer/FloorNet.">this https URL</a> 
### 5.Iterative Learning with Open-set Noisy Labels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00092.pdf)
> Large-scale datasets possessing clean label annotations are crucial for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, labeling large-scale data can be very costly and error-prone, and even high-quality datasets are likely to contain noisy (incorrect) labels. Existing works usually employ a closed-set assumption, whereby the samples associated with noisy labels possess a true class contained within the set of known classes in the training data. However, such an assumption is too restrictive for many applications, since samples associated with noisy labels might in fact possess a true class that is not present in the training data. We refer to this more complex scenario as the \textbf{open-set noisy label} problem and show that it is nontrivial in order to make accurate predictions. To address this problem, we propose a novel iterative learning framework for training CNNs on datasets with open-set noisy labels. Our approach detects noisy labels and learns deep discriminative features in an iterative fashion. To benefit from the noisy label detection, we design a Siamese network to encourage clean labels and noisy labels to be dissimilar. A reweighting module is also applied to simultaneously emphasize the learning from clean labels and reduce the effect caused by noisy labels. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet and real-world noisy (web-search) datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can robustly train CNNs in the presence of a high proportion of open-set as well as closed-set noisy labels. 
### 6.Adversarial Attacks and Defences Competition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00097.pdf)
> To accelerate research on adversarial examples and robustness of machine learning classifiers, Google Brain organized a NIPS 2017 competition that encouraged researchers to develop new methods to generate adversarial examples as well as to develop new ways to defend against them. In this chapter, we describe the structure and organization of the competition and the solutions developed by several of the top-placing teams. 
### 7.Bidirectional Attentive Fusion with Context Gating for Dense Video  Captioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00100.pdf)
> Dense video captioning is a newly emerging task that aims at both localizing and describing all events in a video. We identify and tackle two challenges on this task, namely, (1) how to utilize both past and future contexts for accurate event proposal predictions, and (2) how to construct informative input to the decoder for generating natural event descriptions. First, previous works predominantly generate temporal event proposals in the forward direction, which neglects future video context. We propose a bidirectional proposal method that effectively exploits both past and future contexts to make proposal predictions. Second, different events ending at (nearly) the same time are indistinguishable in the previous works, resulting in the same captions. We solve this problem by representing each event with an attentive fusion of hidden states from the proposal module and video contents (e.g., C3D features). We further propose a novel context gating mechanism to balance the contributions from the current event and its surrounding contexts dynamically. We empirically show that our attentively fused event representation is superior to the proposal hidden states or video contents alone. By coupling proposal and captioning modules into one unified framework, our model outperforms the state-of-the-arts on the ActivityNet Captions dataset with a relative gain of over 100% (Meteor score increases from 4.82 to 9.65). 
### 8.A LiDAR Point Cloud Generator: from a Virtual World to Autonomous  Driving [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00103.pdf)
> 3D LiDAR scanners are playing an increasingly important role in autonomous driving as they can generate depth information of the environment. However, creating large 3D LiDAR point cloud datasets with point-level labels requires a significant amount of manual annotation. This jeopardizes the efficient development of supervised deep learning algorithms which are often data-hungry. We present a framework to rapidly create point clouds with accurate point-level labels from a computer game. The framework supports data collection from both auto-driving scenes and user-configured scenes. Point clouds from auto-driving scenes can be used as training data for deep learning algorithms, while point clouds from user-configured scenes can be used to systematically test the vulnerability of a neural network, and use the falsifying examples to make the neural network more robust through retraining. In addition, the scene images can be captured simultaneously in order for sensor fusion tasks, with a method proposed to do automatic calibration between the point clouds and captured scene images. We show a significant improvement in accuracy (+9%) in point cloud segmentation by augmenting the training dataset with the generated synthesized data. Our experiments also show by testing and retraining the network using point clouds from user-configured scenes, the weakness/blind spots of the neural network can be fixed. 
### 9.Visual Question Reasoning on General Dependency Tree [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00105.pdf)
> The collaborative reasoning for understanding each image-question pair is very critical but under-explored for an interpretable Visual Question Answering (VQA) system. Although very recent works also tried the explicit compositional processes to assemble multiple sub-tasks embedded in the questions, their models heavily rely on the annotations or hand-crafted rules to obtain valid reasoning layout, leading to either heavy labor or poor performance on composition reasoning. In this paper, to enable global context reasoning for better aligning image and language domains in diverse and unrestricted cases, we propose a novel reasoning network called Adversarial Composition Modular Network (ACMN). This network comprises of two collaborative modules: i) an adversarial attention module to exploit the local visual evidence for each word parsed from the question; ii) a residual composition module to compose the previously mined evidence. Given a dependency parse tree for each question, the adversarial attention module progressively discovers salient regions of one word by densely combining regions of child word nodes in an adversarial manner. Then residual composition module merges the hidden representations of an arbitrary number of children through sum pooling and residual connection. Our ACMN is thus capable of building an interpretable VQA system that gradually dives the image cues following a question-driven reasoning route and makes global reasoning by incorporating the learned knowledge of all attention modules in a principled manner. Experiments on relational datasets demonstrate the superiority of our ACMN and visualization results show the explainable capability of our reasoning system. 
### 10.Compare and Contrast: Learning Prominent Visual Differences [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00112.pdf)
> Relative attribute models can compare images in terms of all detected properties or attributes, exhaustively predicting which image is fancier, more natural, and so on without any regard to ordering. However, when humans compare images, certain differences will naturally stick out and come to mind first. These most noticeable differences, or prominent differences, are likely to be described first. In addition, many differences, although present, may not be mentioned at all. In this work, we introduce and model prominent differences, a rich new functionality for comparing images. We collect instance-level annotations of most noticeable differences, and build a model trained on relative attribute features that predicts prominent differences for unseen pairs. We test our model on the challenging UT-Zap50K shoes and LFW10 faces datasets, and outperform an array of baseline methods. We then demonstrate how our prominence model improves two vision tasks, image search and description generation, enabling more natural communication between people and vision systems. 
### 11.Tagging like Humans: Diverse and Distinct Image Annotation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00113.pdf)
> In this work we propose a new automatic image annotation model, dubbed {\bf diverse and distinct image annotation} (D2IA). The generative model D2IA is inspired by the ensemble of human annotations, which create semantically relevant, yet distinct and diverse tags. In D2IA, we generate a relevant and distinct tag subset, in which the tags are relevant to the image contents and semantically distinct to each other, using sequential sampling from a determinantal point process (DPP) model. Multiple such tag subsets that cover diverse semantic aspects or diverse semantic levels of the image contents are generated by randomly perturbing the DPP sampling process. We leverage a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to train D2IA. Extensive experiments including quantitative and qualitative comparisons, as well as human subject studies, on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can produce more diverse and distinct tags than the state-of-the-arts. 
### 12.Multi-label Learning with Missing Labels using Mixed Dependency Graphs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00117.pdf)
> This work focuses on the problem of multi-label learning with missing labels (MLML), which aims to label each test instance with multiple class labels given training instances that have an incomplete/partial set of these labels. The key point to handle missing labels is propagating the label information from provided labels to missing labels, through a dependency graph that each label of each instance is treated as a node. We build this graph by utilizing different types of label dependencies. Specifically, the instance-level similarity is served as undirected edges to connect the label nodes across different instances and the semantic label hierarchy is used as directed edges to connect different classes. This base graph is referred to as the mixed dependency graph, as it includes both undirected and directed edges. Furthermore, we present another two types of label dependencies to connect the label nodes across different classes. One is the class co-occurrence, which is also encoded as undirected edges. Combining with the base graph, we obtain a new mixed graph, called MG-CO (mixed graph with co-occurrence). The other is the sparse and low rank decomposition of the whole label matrix, to embed high-order dependencies over all labels. Combining with the base graph, the new mixed graph is called as MG-SL (mixed graph with sparse and low rank decomposition). Based on MG-CO and MG-SL, we propose two convex transductive formulations of the MLML problem, denoted as MLMG-CO and MLMG-SL, respectively. Two important applications, including image annotation and tag based image retrieval, can be jointly handled using our proposed methods. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our methods give significant improvements in performance and robustness to missing labels over the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 13.Quantitative Evaluation of Style Transfer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00118.pdf)
> Style transfer methods produce a transferred image which is a rendering of a content image in the manner of a style image. There is a rich literature of variant methods. However, evaluation procedures are qualitative, mostly involving user studies. We describe a novel quantitative evaluation procedure. One plots effectiveness (a measure of the extent to which the style was transferred) against coherence (a measure of the extent to which the transferred image decomposes into objects in the same way that the content image does) to obtain an EC plot. <br />We construct EC plots comparing a number of recent style transfer methods. Most methods control within-layer gram matrices, but we also investigate a method that controls cross-layer gram matrices. These EC plots reveal a number of intriguing properties of recent style transfer methods. The style used has a strong effect on the outcome, for all methods. Using large style weights does not necessarily improve effectiveness, and can produce worse results. Cross-layer gram matrices easily beat all other methods, but some styles remain difficult for all methods. Ensemble methods show real promise. It is likely that, for current methods, each style requires a different choice of weights to obtain the best results, so that automated weight setting methods are desirable. Finally, we show evidence comparing our EC evaluations to human evaluations. 
### 14.Snap Angle Prediction for 360$^{\circ}$ Panoramas [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00126.pdf)
> 360$^{\circ}$ panoramas are a rich medium, yet notoriously difficult to visualize in the 2D image plane. We explore how intelligent rotations of a spherical image may enable content-aware projection with fewer perceptible distortions. Whereas existing approaches assume the viewpoint is fixed, intuitively some viewing angles within the sphere preserve high-level objects better than others. To discover the relationship between these optimal snap angles and the spherical panorama's content, we develop a reinforcement learning approach for the cubemap projection model. Implemented as a deep recurrent neural network, our method selects a sequence of rotation actions and receives reward for avoiding cube boundaries that overlap with important foreground objects. We show our approach creates more visually pleasing panoramas while using 5x less computation than the baseline. 
### 15.A Subpixel Registration Algorithm for Low PSNR Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00174.pdf)
> This paper presents a fast algorithm for obtaining high-accuracy subpixel translation of low PSNR images. Instead of locating the maximum point on the upsampled images or fitting the peak of correlation surface, the proposed algorithm is based on the measurement of centroid on the cross correlation surface by Modified Moment method. Synthetic images, real solar images and standard testing images with white Gaussian noise added were tested, and the results show that the accuracies of our algorithm are comparable with other subpixel registration techniques and the processing speed is higher. The drawback is also discussed at the end of this paper. 
### 16.DeepIM: Deep Iterative Matching for 6D Pose Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00175.pdf)
> Estimating the 6D pose of objects from images is an important problem in various applications such as robot manipulation and virtual reality. While direct regression of images to object poses has limited accuracy, matching rendered images of an object against the observed image can produce accurate results. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural network for 6D pose matching named DeepIM. Given an initial pose estimation, our network is able to iteratively refine the pose by matching the rendered image against the observed image. The network is trained to predict a relative pose transformation using an untangled representation of 3D location and 3D orientation and an iterative training process. Experiments on two commonly used benchmarks for 6D pose estimation demonstrate that DeepIM achieves large improvements over state-of-the-art methods. We furthermore show that DeepIM is able to match previously unseen objects. 
### 17.Webly Supervised Learning for Skin Lesion Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00177.pdf)
> Within medical imaging, manual curation of sufficient well-labeled samples is cost, time and scale-prohibitive. To improve the representativeness of the training dataset, for the first time, we present an approach to utilize large amounts of freely available web data through web-crawling. To handle noise and weak nature of web annotations, we propose a two-step transfer learning based training process with a robust loss function, termed as Webly Supervised Learning (WSL) to train deep models for the task. We also leverage search by image to improve the search specificity of our web-crawling and reduce cross-domain noise. Within WSL, we explicitly model the noise structure between classes and incorporate it to selectively distill knowledge from the web data during model training. To demonstrate improved performance due to WSL, we benchmarked on a publicly available 10-class fine-grained skin lesion classification dataset and report a significant improvement of top-1 classification accuracy from 71.25 % to 80.53 % due to the incorporation of web-supervision. 
### 18.Presentation Attack Detection for Iris Recognition: An Assessment of the  State of the Art [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00194.pdf)
> Iris recognition is increasingly used in large-scale applications. As a result, presentation attack detection for iris recognition takes on fundamental importance. This survey covers the diverse research literature on this topic. Different categories of presentation attack are described and placed in an application-relevant framework, and the state of the art in detecting each category of attack is summarized. One conclusion from this is that presentation attack detection for iris recognition is not yet a solved problem. Datasets available for research are described, research directions for the near- and medium-term future are outlined, and a short list of recommended readings are suggested. 
### 19.Gated Fusion Network for Single Image Dehazing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00213.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to directly restore a clear image from a hazy input. The proposed algorithm hinges on an end-to-end trainable neural network that consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is exploited to capture the context of the derived input images, while the decoder is employed to estimate the contribution of each input to the final dehazed result using the learned representations attributed to the encoder. The constructed network adopts a novel fusion-based strategy which derives three inputs from an original hazy image by applying White Balance (WB), Contrast Enhancing (CE), and Gamma Correction (GC). We compute pixel-wise confidence maps based on the appearance differences between these different inputs to blend the information of the derived inputs and preserve the regions with pleasant visibility. The final dehazed image is yielded by gating the important features of the derived inputs. To train the network, we introduce a multi-scale approach such that the halo artifacts can be avoided. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms. 
### 20.Human Semantic Parsing for Person Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00216.pdf)
> Person re-identification is a challenging task mainly due to factors such as background clutter, pose, illumination and camera point of view variations. These elements hinder the process of extracting robust and discriminative representations, hence preventing different identities from being successfully distinguished. To improve the representation learning, usually, local features from human body parts are extracted. However, the common practice for such a process has been based on bounding box part detection. In this paper, we propose to adopt human semantic parsing which, due to its pixel-level accuracy and capability of modeling arbitrary contours, is naturally a better alternative. Our proposed SPReID integrates human semantic parsing in person re-identification and not only considerably outperforms its counter baseline, but achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also show that by employing a \textit{simple} yet effective training strategy, standard popular deep convolutional architectures such as Inception-V3 and ResNet-152, with no modification, while operating solely on full image, can dramatically outperform current state-of-the-art. Our proposed methods improve state-of-the-art person re-identification on: Market-1501 by ~17% in mAP and ~6% in rank-1, CUHK03 by ~4% in rank-1 and DukeMTMC-reID by ~24% in mAP and ~10% in rank-1. 
### 21.Combining STDP and Reward-Modulated STDP in Deep Convolutional Spiking  Neural Networks for Digit Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00227.pdf)
> The primate visual system has inspired the development of deep artificial neural networks, which have revolutionized the computer vision domain. Yet these networks are much less energy-efficient than their biological counterparts, and they are typically trained with backpropagation, which is extremely data-hungry. To address these limitations, we used a deep convolutional spiking neural network (DCSNN) and a latency-coding scheme. We trained it using a combination of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for the lowest layers and reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) for the highest ones. In short, with R-STDP a correct (resp. incorrect) decision leads to STDP (resp. anti-STDP). This approach led to an accuracy of 97.2% on MNIST, without requiring an external classifier. In addition, we demonstrated that R-STDP extracts features that are diagnostic for the task at hand, and discards the other ones, whereas STDP extracts any feature that repeats. Finally, our approach is biologically plausible, hardware friendly, and energy-efficient. 
### 22.Recognizing Challenging Handwritten Annotations with Fully Convolutional  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00236.pdf)
> This paper introduces a very challenging dataset of historic German documents and evaluates Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) based methods to locate handwritten annotations of any kind in these documents. The handwritten annotations can appear in form of underlines and text by using various writing instruments, e.g., the use of pencils makes the data more challenging. We train and evaluate various end-to-end semantic segmentation approaches and report the results. The task is to classify the pixels of documents into two classes: background and handwritten annotation. The best model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 95.6% on the test documents of the presented dataset. We also present a comparison of different strategies used for data augmentation and training on our presented dataset. For evaluation, we use the Layout Analysis Evaluator for the ICDAR 2017 Competition on Layout Analysis for Challenging Medieval Manuscripts. 
### 23.Graph Correspondence Transfer for Person Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00242.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a graph correspondence transfer (GCT) approach for person re-identification. Unlike existing methods, the GCT model formulates person re-identification as an off-line graph matching and on-line correspondence transferring problem. In specific, during training, the GCT model aims to learn off-line a set of correspondence templates from positive training pairs with various pose-pair configurations via patch-wise graph matching. During testing, for each pair of test samples, we select a few training pairs with the most similar pose-pair configurations as references, and transfer the correspondences of these references to test pair for feature distance calculation. The matching score is derived by aggregating distances from different references. For each probe image, the gallery image with the highest matching score is the re-identifying result. Compared to existing algorithms, our GCT can handle spatial misalignment caused by large variations in view angles and human poses owing to the benefits of patch-wise graph matching. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks including VIPeR, Road, PRID450S, 3DPES and CUHK01 evidence the superior performance of GCT model over other state-of-the-art methods. 
### 24.SampleAhead: Online Classifier-Sampler Communication for Learning from  Synthesized Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00248.pdf)
> State-of-the-art techniques of artificial intelligence, in particular deep learning, are mostly data-driven. However, collecting and manually labeling a large scale dataset is both difficult and expensive. A promising alternative is to introduce synthesized training data, so that the dataset size can be significantly enlarged with little human labor. But, this raises an important problem in active vision: given an {\bf infinite} data space, how to effectively sample a {\bf finite} subset to train a visual classifier? This paper presents an approach for learning from synthesized data effectively. The motivation is straightforward -- increasing the probability of seeing difficult training data. We introduce a module named {\bf SampleAhead} to formulate the learning process into an online communication between a {\em classifier} and a {\em sampler}, and update them iteratively. In each round, we adjust the sampling distribution according to the classification results, and train the classifier using the data sampled from the updated distribution. Experiments are performed by introducing synthesized images rendered from ShapeNet models to assist PASCAL3D+ classification. Our approach enjoys higher classification accuracy, especially in the scenario of a limited number of training samples. This demonstrates its efficiency in exploring the infinite data space. 
### 25.One-Two-One Networks for Compression Artifacts Reduction in Remote  Sensing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00256.pdf)
> Compression artifacts reduction (CAR) is a challenging problem in the field of remote sensing. Most recent deep learning based methods have demonstrated superior performance over the previous hand-crafted methods. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end one-two-one (OTO) network, to combine different deep models, i.e., summation and difference models, to solve the CAR problem. Particularly, the difference model motivated by the Laplacian pyramid is designed to obtain the high frequency information, while the summation model aggregates the low frequency information. We provide an in-depth investigation into our OTO architecture based on the Taylor expansion, which shows that these two kinds of information can be fused in a nonlinear scheme to gain more capacity of handling complicated image compression artifacts, especially the blocking effect in compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the OTO networks, as compared to the state-of-the-arts on remote sensing datasets and other benchmark datasets. 
### 26.Real-time Progressive 3D Semantic Segmentation for Indoor Scene [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00257.pdf)
> The widespread adoption of autonomous systems such as drones and assistant robots has created a need for real-time high-quality semantic scene segmentation. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet robust technique for on-the-fly dense reconstruction and semantic segmentation of 3D indoor scenes. To guarantee real-time performance, our method is built atop small clusters of voxels and a conditional random field with higher-order constraints from structural and object cues, enabling progressive dense semantic segmentation without any precomputation. We extensively evaluate our method on different indoor scenes including kitchens, offices, and bedrooms in the SceneNN and ScanNet datasets and show that our technique consistently produces state-of-the-art segmentation results in both qualitative and quantitative experiments. 
### 27.Differential Attention for Visual Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00298.pdf)
> In this paper we aim to answer questions based on images when provided with a dataset of question-answer pairs for a number of images during training. A number of methods have focused on solving this problem by using image based attention. This is done by focusing on a specific part of the image while answering the question. Humans also do so when solving this problem. However, the regions that the previous systems focus on are not correlated with the regions that humans focus on. The accuracy is limited due to this drawback. In this paper, we propose to solve this problem by using an exemplar based method. We obtain one or more supporting and opposing exemplars to obtain a differential attention region. This differential attention is closer to human attention than other image based attention methods. It also helps in obtaining improved accuracy when answering questions. The method is evaluated on challenging benchmark datasets. We perform better than other image based attention methods and are competitive with other state of the art methods that focus on both image and questions. 
### 28.Fully automatic detection and segmentation of abdominal aortic thrombus  in post-operative CTA images using deep convolutional neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00304.pdf)
> Computerized Tomography Angiography (CTA) based follow-up of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) treated with Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) is essential to evaluate the progress of the patient and detect complications. In this context, accurate quantification of post-operative thrombus volume is required. However, a proper evaluation is hindered by the lack of automatic, robust and reproducible thrombus segmentation algorithms. We propose a new fully automatic approach based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for robust and reproducible thrombus region of interest detection and subsequent fine thrombus segmentation. The DetecNet detection network is adapted to perform region of interest extraction from a complete CTA and a new segmentation network architecture, based on Fully Convolutional Networks and a Holistically-Nested Edge Detection Network, is presented. These networks are trained, validated and tested in 13 post-operative CTA volumes of different patients using a 4-fold cross-validation approach to provide more robustness to the results. Our pipeline achieves a Dice score of more than 82% for post-operative thrombus segmentation and provides a mean relative volume difference between ground truth and automatic segmentation that lays within the experienced human observer variance without the need of human intervention in most common cases. 
### 29.Robust Fruit Counting: Combining Deep Learning, Tracking, and Structure  from Motion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00307.pdf)
> We present a novel fruit counting pipeline that combines deep segmentation, frame to frame tracking, and 3D localization to accurately count visible fruits across a sequence of images. Our pipeline works on image streams from a monocular camera, both in natural light, as well as with controlled illumination at night. We first train a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and segment video frame images into fruit and non-fruit pixels. We then track fruits across frames using the Hungarian Algorithm where the objective cost is determined from a Kalman Filter corrected Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) Tracker. In order to correct the estimated count from tracking process, we combine tracking results with a Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm to calculate relative 3D locations and size estimates to reject outliers and double counted fruit tracks. We evaluate our algorithm by comparing with ground-truth human-annotated visual counts. Our results demonstrate that our pipeline is able to accurately and reliably count fruits across image sequences, and the correction step can significantly improve the counting accuracy and robustness. Although discussed in the context of fruit counting, our work can extend to detection, tracking, and counting of a variety of other stationary features of interest such as leaf-spots, wilt, and blossom. 
### 30.Seeing Voices and Hearing Faces: Cross-modal biometric matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00326.pdf)
> We introduce a seemingly impossible task: given only an audio clip of someone speaking, decide which of two face images is the speaker. In this paper we study this, and a number of related cross-modal tasks, aimed at answering the question: how much can we infer from the voice about the face and vice versa? We study this task "in the wild", employing the datasets that are now publicly available for face recognition from static images (VGGFace) and speaker identification from audio (VoxCeleb). These provide training and testing scenarios for both static and dynamic testing of cross-modal matching. We make the following contributions: (i) we introduce CNN architectures for both binary and multi-way cross-modal face and audio matching, (ii) we compare dynamic testing (where video information is available, but the audio is not from the same video) with static testing (where only a single still image is available), and (iii) we use human testing as a baseline to calibrate the difficulty of the task. We show that a CNN can indeed be trained to solve this task in both the static and dynamic scenarios, and is even well above chance on 10-way classification of the face given the voice. The CNN matches human performance on easy examples (e.g. different gender across faces) but exceeds human performance on more challenging examples (e.g. faces with the same gender, age and nationality). 
### 31.Unsupervised Correlation Analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00347.pdf)
> Linking between two data sources is a basic building block in numerous computer vision problems. In this paper, we set to answer a fundamental cognitive question: are prior correspondences necessary for linking between different domains? <br />One of the most popular methods for linking between domains is Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). All current CCA algorithms require correspondences between the views. We introduce a new method Unsupervised Correlation Analysis (UCA), which requires no prior correspondences between the two domains. The correlation maximization term in CCA is replaced by a combination of a reconstruction term (similar to autoencoders), full cycle loss, orthogonality and multiple domain confusion terms. Due to lack of supervision, the optimization leads to multiple alternative solutions with similar scores and we therefore introduce a consensus-based mechanism that is often able to recover the desired solution. Remarkably, this suffices in order to link remote domains such as text and images. We also present results on well accepted CCA benchmarks, showing that performance far exceeds other unsupervised baselines, and approaches supervised performance in some cases. 
### 32.End-to-End Detection and Re-identification Integrated Net for Person  Search [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00376.pdf)
> This paper proposes a pedestrian detection and re-identification (re-id) integration net (I-Net) in an end-to-end learning framework. The I-Net is used in real-world video surveillance scenarios, where the target person needs to be searched in the whole scene videos, while the annotations of pedestrian bounding boxes are unavailable. By comparing to the OIM which is a work for joint detection and re-id, we have three distinct contributions. First, we introduce a Siamese architecture of I-Net instead of 1 stream, such that a verification task can be implemented. Second, we propose a novel on-line pairing loss (OLP) and hard example priority softmax loss (HEP), such that only the hard negatives are posed much attention in loss computation. Third, an on-line dictionary for negative samples storage is designed in I-Net without recording the positive samples. We show our result on person search datasets, the gap between detection and re-identification is narrowed. The superior performance can be achieved. 
### 33.Attention-based Ensemble for Deep Metric Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00382.pdf)
> Deep metric learning aims to learn an embedding function, modeled as deep neural network. This embedding function usually puts semantically similar images close while dissimilar images far from each other in the learned embedding space. Recently, ensemble has been applied to deep metric learning to yield state-of-the-art results. As one important aspect of ensemble, the learners should be diverse in their feature embeddings. To this end, we propose an attention-based ensemble, which uses multiple attention masks, so that each learner can attend to different parts of the object. We also propose a divergence loss, which encourages diversity among the learners. The proposed method is applied to the standard benchmarks of deep metric learning and experimental results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on image retrieval tasks. 
### 34.Low-Latency Video Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00389.pdf)
> Recent years have seen remarkable progress in semantic segmentation. Yet, it remains a challenging task to apply segmentation techniques to video-based applications. Specifically, the high throughput of video streams, the sheer cost of running fully convolutional networks, together with the low-latency requirements in many real-world applications, e.g. autonomous driving, present a significant challenge to the design of the video segmentation framework. To tackle this combined challenge, we develop a framework for video semantic segmentation, which incorporates two novel components: (1) a feature propagation module that adaptively fuses features over time via spatially variant convolution, thus reducing the cost of per-frame computation; and (2) an adaptive scheduler that dynamically allocate computation based on accuracy prediction. Both components work together to ensure low latency while maintaining high segmentation quality. On both Cityscapes and CamVid, the proposed framework obtained competitive performance compared to the state of the art, while substantially reducing the latency, from 360 ms to 119 ms. 
### 35.Bridging the Gap Between 2D and 3D Organ Segmentation with Volumetric  Fusion Net [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00392.pdf)
> There has been a debate on whether to use 2D or 3D deep neural networks for volumetric organ segmentation. Both 2D and 3D models have their advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we present an alternative framework, which trains 2D networks on different viewpoints for segmentation, and builds a 3D Volumetric Fusion Net (VFN) to fuse the 2D segmentation results. VFN is relatively shallow and contains much fewer parameters than most 3D networks, making our framework more efficient at integrating 3D information for segmentation. We train and test the segmentation and fusion modules individually, and propose a novel strategy, named cross-cross-augmentation, to make full use of the limited training data. We evaluate our framework on several challenging abdominal organs, and verify its superiority in segmentation accuracy and stability over existing 2D and 3D approaches. 
### 36.Generative Spatiotemporal Modeling Of Neutrophil Behavior [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00393.pdf)
> Cell motion and appearance have a strong correlation with cell cycle and disease progression. Many contemporary efforts in machine learning utilize spatio-temporal models to predict a cell's physical state and, consequently, the advancement of disease. Alternatively, generative models learn the underlying distribution of the data, creating holistic representations that can be used in learning. In this work, we propose an aggregate model that combine Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Autoregressive (AR) models to predict cell motion and appearance in human neutrophils imaged by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. We bifurcate the task of learning cell statistics by leveraging GANs for the spatial component and AR models for the temporal component. The aggregate model learned results offer a promising computational environment for studying changes in organellar shape, quantity, and spatial distribution over large sequences. 
### 37.SyncGAN: Synchronize the Latent Space of Cross-modal Generative  Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00410.pdf)
> Generative adversarial network (GAN) has achieved impressive success on cross-domain generation, but it faces difficulty in cross-modal generation due to the lack of a common distribution between heterogeneous data. Most existing methods of conditional based cross-modal GANs adopt the strategy of one-directional transfer and have achieved preliminary success on text-to-image transfer. Instead of learning the transfer between different modalities, we aim to learn a synchronous latent space representing the cross-modal common concept. A novel network component named synchronizer is proposed in this work to judge whether the paired data is synchronous/corresponding or not, which can constrain the latent space of generators in the GANs. Our GAN model, named as SyncGAN, can successfully generate synchronous data (e.g., a pair of image and sound) from identical random noise. For transforming data from one modality to another, we recover the latent code by inverting the mappings of a generator and use it to generate data of different modality. In addition, the proposed model can achieve semi-supervised learning, which makes our model more flexible for practical applications. 
### 38.End-to-End Learning of Motion Representation for Video Understanding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00413.pdf)
> Despite the recent success of end-to-end learned representations, hand-crafted optical flow features are still widely used in video analysis tasks. To fill this gap, we propose TVNet, a novel end-to-end trainable neural network, to learn optical-flow-like features from data. TVNet subsumes a specific optical flow solver, the TV-L1 method, and is initialized by unfolding its optimization iterations as neural layers. TVNet can therefore be used directly without any extra learning. Moreover, it can be naturally concatenated with other task-specific networks to formulate an end-to-end architecture, thus making our method more efficient than current multi-stage approaches by avoiding the need to pre-compute and store features on disk. Finally, the parameters of the TVNet can be further fine-tuned by end-to-end training. This enables TVNet to learn richer and task-specific patterns beyond exact optical flow. Extensive experiments on two action recognition benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our TVNet achieves better accuracies than all compared methods, while being competitive with the fastest counterpart in terms of features extraction time. 
### 39.Multi-scale Location-aware Kernel Representation for Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00428.pdf)
> Although Faster R-CNN and its variants have shown promising performance in object detection, they only exploit simple first-order representation of object proposals for final classification and regression. Recent classification methods demonstrate that the integration of high-order statistics into deep convolutional neural networks can achieve impressive improvement, but their goal is to model whole images by discarding location information so that they cannot be directly adopted to object detection. In this paper, we make an attempt to exploit high-order statistics in object detection, aiming at generating more discriminative representations for proposals to enhance the performance of detectors. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-scale Location-aware Kernel Representation (MLKP) to capture high-order statistics of deep features in proposals. Our MLKP can be efficiently computed on a modified multi-scale feature map using a low-dimensional polynomial kernel approximation.Moreover, different from existing orderless global representations based on high-order statistics, our proposed MLKP is location retentive and sensitive so that it can be flexibly adopted to object detection. Through integrating into Faster R-CNN schema, the proposed MLKP achieves very competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, and improves Faster R-CNN by 4.9% (mAP), 4.7% (mAP) and 5.0% (AP at IOU=[0.5:0.05:0.95]) on PASCAL VOC 2007, VOC 2012 and MS COCO benchmarks, respectively. Code is available at: <a href="https://github.com/Hwang64/MLKP.">this https URL</a> 
### 40.A Vehicle Detection Approach using Deep Learning Methodologies [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00429.pdf)
> The purpose of this study is to successfully train our vehicle detector using R-CNN, Faster R-CNN deep learning methods on a sample vehicle data sets and to optimize the success rate of the trained detector by providing efficient results for vehicle detection by testing the trained vehicle detector on the test data. The working method consists of six main stages. These are respectively; loading the data set, the design of the convolutional neural network, configuration of training options, training of the Faster R-CNN object detector and evaluation of trained detector. In addition, in the scope of the study, Faster R-CNN, R-CNN deep learning methods were mentioned and experimental analysis comparisons were made with the results obtained from vehicle detection. 
### 41.Deep Residual Learning for Accelerated MRI using Magnitude and Phase  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00432.pdf)
> Accelerated magnetic resonance (MR) scan acquisition with compressed sensing (CS) and parallel imaging is a powerful method to reduce MR imaging scan time. However, many reconstruction algorithms have high computational costs. To address this, we investigate deep residual learning networks to remove aliasing artifacts from artifact corrupted images. The proposed deep residual learning networks are composed of magnitude and phase networks that are separately trained. If both phase and magnitude information are available, the proposed algorithm can work as an iterative k-space interpolation algorithm using framelet representation. When only magnitude data is available, the proposed approach works as an image domain post-processing algorithm. Even with strong coherent aliasing artifacts, the proposed network successfully learned and removed the aliasing artifacts, whereas current parallel and CS reconstruction methods were unable to remove these artifacts. Comparisons using single and multiple coil show that the proposed residual network provides good reconstruction results with orders of magnitude faster computational time than existing compressed sensing methods. The proposed deep learning framework may have a great potential for accelerated MR reconstruction by generating accurate results immediately. 
### 42.SINet: A Scale-insensitive Convolutional Neural Network for Fast Vehicle  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00433.pdf)
> Vision-based vehicle detection approaches achieve incredible success in recent years with the development of deep convolutional neural network (CNN). However, existing CNN based algorithms suffer from the problem that the convolutional features are scale-sensitive in object detection task but it is common that traffic images and videos contain vehicles with a large variance of scales. In this paper, we delve into the source of scale sensitivity, and reveal two key issues: 1) existing RoI pooling destroys the structure of small scale objects, 2) the large intra-class distance for a large variance of scales exceeds the representation capability of a single network. Based on these findings, we present a scale-insensitive convolutional neural network (SINet) for fast detecting vehicles with a large variance of scales. First, we present a context-aware RoI pooling to maintain the contextual information and original structure of small scale objects. Second, we present a multi-branch decision network to minimize the intra-class distance of features. These lightweight techniques bring zero extra time complexity but prominent detection accuracy improvement. The proposed techniques can be equipped with any deep network architectures and keep them trained end-to-end. Our SINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and speed (up to 37 FPS) on the KITTI benchmark and a new highway dataset, which contains a large variance of scales and extremely small objects. 
### 43.Exploring to learn visual saliency: The RL-IAC approach [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00435.pdf)
> The problem of object localization and recognition on autonomous mobile robots is still an active topic. In this context, we tackle the problem of learning a model of visual saliency directly on a robot. This model, learned and improved on-the-fly during the robot's exploration provides an efficient tool for localizing relevant objects within their environment. The proposed approach includes two intertwined components. On the one hand, we describe a method for learning and incrementally updating a model of visual saliency from a depth-based object detector. This model of saliency can also be exploited to produce bounding box proposals around objects of interest. On the other hand, we investigate an autonomous exploration technique to efficiently learn such a saliency model. The proposed exploration, called Reinforcement Learning-Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity (RL-IAC) is able to drive the robot's exploration so that samples selected by the robot are likely to improve the current model of saliency. We then demonstrate that such a saliency model learned directly on a robot outperforms several state-of-the-art saliency techniques, and that RL-IAC can drastically decrease the required time for learning a reliable saliency model. 
### 44.Fixed-sized representation learning from Offline Handwritten Signatures  of different sizes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00448.pdf)
> Methods for learning feature representations for Offline Handwritten Signature Verification have been successfully proposed in recent literature, using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to learn representations from signature pixels. Such methods reported large performance improvements compared to handcrafted feature extractors. However, they also introduced an important constraint: the inputs to the neural networks must have a fixed size, while signatures vary significantly in size between different users. In this paper we propose addressing this issue by learning a fixed-sized representation from variable-sized signatures by modifying the network architecture, using Spatial Pyramid Pooling. We also investigate the impact of the resolution of the images used for training, and the impact of adapting (fine-tuning) the representations to new operating conditions (different acquisition protocols, such as writing instruments and scan resolution). On the GPDS dataset, we achieve results comparable with the state-of-the-art, while removing the constraint of having a maximum size for the signatures to be processed. We also show that using higher resolutions (300 or 600dpi) can improve performance when skilled forgeries from a subset of users are available for feature learning, but lower resolutions (around 100dpi) can be used if only genuine signatures are used. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning can improve performance when the operating conditions change. 
### 45.Learnable Image Encryption [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00490.pdf)
> The network-based machine learning algorithm is very powerful tools. However, it requires huge training dataset. Researchers often meet privacy issues when they collect image dataset especially for surveillance applications. A learnable image encryption scheme is introduced. The key idea of this scheme is to encrypt images, so that human cannot understand images but the network can be train with encrypted images. This scheme allows us to train the network without the privacy issues. In this paper, a simple learnable image encryption algorithm is proposed. Then, the proposed algorithm is validated with cifar dataset. 
### 46.Regional Priority Based Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00492.pdf)
> In the recent times, autoencoders, besides being used for compression, have been proven quite useful even for regenerating similar images or help in image denoising. They have also been explored for anomaly detection in a few cases. However, due to location invariance property of convolutional neural network, autoencoders tend to learn from or search for learned features in the complete image. This creates issues when all the items in the image are not equally important and their location matters. For such cases, a semi supervised solution - regional priority based autoencoder (RPAE) has been proposed. In this model, similar to object detection models, a region proposal network identifies the relevant areas in the images as belonging to one of the predefined categories and then those bounding boxes are fed into appropriate decoder based on the category they belong to. Finally, the error scores from all the decoders are combined based on their importance to provide total reconstruction error. 
### 47.A Review on Image Texture Analysis Methods [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00494.pdf)
> Texture classification is an active topic in image processing which plays an important role in many applications such as image retrieval, inspection systems, face recognition, medical image processing, etc. There are many approaches extracting texture features in gray-level images such as local binary patterns, gray level co-occurrence matrices, statistical features, skeleton, scale invariant feature transform, etc. The texture analysis methods can be categorized in 4 groups titles: statistical methods, structural methods, filter-based and model based approaches. In many related researches, authors have tried to extract color and texture features jointly. In this respect, combined methods are considered as efficient image analysis descriptors. Mostly important challenges in image texture analysis are rotation sensitivity, gray scale variations, noise sensitivity, illumination and brightness conditions, etc. In this paper, we review most efficient and state-of-the-art image texture analysis methods. Also, some texture classification approaches are survived. 
### 48.Transferable Pedestrian Motion Prediction Models at Intersections [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00495.pdf)
> One desirable capability of autonomous cars is to accurately predict the pedestrian motion near intersections for safe and efficient trajectory planning. We are interested in developing transfer learning algorithms that can be trained on the pedestrian trajectories collected at one intersection and yet still provide accurate predictions of the trajectories at another, previously unseen intersection. We first discussed the feature selection for transferable pedestrian motion models in general. Following this discussion, we developed one transferable pedestrian motion prediction algorithm based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) that infers pedestrian intentions and predicts future trajectories based on observed trajectory. We evaluated our algorithm on a dataset collected at two intersections, trained at one intersection and tested at the other intersection. We used the accuracy of augmented semi-nonnegative sparse coding (ASNSC), trained and tested at the same intersection as a baseline. The result shows that the proposed algorithm improves the baseline accuracy by 40% in the non-transfer task, and 16% in the transfer task. 
### 49.muNet: A Highly Compact Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architecture  for Real-time Embedded Traffic Sign Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00497.pdf)
> Traffic sign recognition is a very important computer vision task for a number of real-world applications such as intelligent transportation surveillance and analysis. While deep neural networks have been demonstrated in recent years to provide state-of-the-art performance traffic sign recognition, a key challenge for enabling the widespread deployment of deep neural networks for embedded traffic sign recognition is the high computational and memory requirements of such networks. As a consequence, there are significant benefits in investigating compact deep neural network architectures for traffic sign recognition that are better suited for embedded devices. In this paper, we introduce muNet, a highly compact deep convolutional neural network for real-time embedded traffic sign recognition based on macroarchitecture design principles as well as microarchitecture optimization strategies. The resulting overall architecture of muNet is thus designed with as few parameters and computations as possible while maintaining recognition performance. The resulting muNet possesses a model size of just ~1MB and ~510,000 parameters (~27x fewer parameters than state-of-the-art) while still achieving a human performance level top-1 accuracy of 98.9% on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark. Furthermore, muNet requires just $\sim$10 million multiply-accumulate operations to perform inference. These experimental results show that highly compact, optimized deep neural network architectures can be designed for real-time traffic sign recognition that are well-suited for embedded scenarios. 
### 50.Land use mapping in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area based on semantic  segmentation deep learning method [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00498.pdf)
> The Three Gorges Dam, a massive cross-century project spans the Yangtze River by the town of Sandouping, located in Yichang, Hubei province, China, was built to provide great power, improve the River shipping, control floods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and increase the dry season flow in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Benefits are enormous and comprehensive. However, the social and environmental impacts are also immense and far-reaching to its surrounding areas. Mapping land use /land cover changed (LUCC) is critical for tracking the impacts. Remote sensing has been proved to be an effective way to map and monitor land use change in real time and in large areas such as the Three Gorges Reservoir Area(TGRA) by using pixel based or oriented based classifier in different resolution. In this paper, we first test the state of the art semantic segmentation deep learning classifiers for LUCC mapping with 7 categories in the TGRA area with rapideye 5m resolution data. The topographic information was also added for better accuracy in mountain area. By compared with the pixel-based classifier, the semantic segmentation deep learning method has better accuracy and robustness at 5m resolution level. 
### 51.Semantic Adversarial Examples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00499.pdf)
> Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., images that are maliciously perturbed to fool the model. Generating adversarial examples has been mostly limited to finding small perturbations that maximize the model prediction error. Such images, however, contain artificial perturbations that make them somewhat distinguishable from natural images. This property is used by several defense methods to counter adversarial examples by applying denoising filters or training the model to be robust to small perturbations. <br />In this paper, we introduce a new class of adversarial examples, namely "Semantic Adversarial Examples," as images that are arbitrarily perturbed to fool the model, but in such a way that the modified image semantically represents the same object as the original image. We formulate the problem of generating such images as a constrained optimization problem and develop an adversarial transformation based on the shape bias property of human cognitive system. In our method, we generate adversarial images by first converting the RGB image into the HSV (Hue, Saturation and Value) color space and then randomly shifting the Hue and Saturation components, while keeping the Value component the same. Our experimental results on CIFAR10 dataset show that the accuracy of VGG16 network on adversarial color-shifted images is 5.7%. 
### 52.Multilayer Complex Network Descriptors for Color-Texture  Characterization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00501.pdf)
> A new method based on complex networks is proposed for color-texture analysis. The proposal consists on modeling the image as a multilayer complex network where each color channel is a layer, and each pixel (in each color channel) is represented as a network vertex. The network dynamic evolution is accessed using a set of modeling parameters (radii and thresholds), and new characterization techniques are introduced to capt information regarding within and between color channel spatial interaction. An automatic and adaptive approach for threshold selection is also proposed. We conduct classification experiments on 5 well-known datasets: Vistex, Usptex, Outex13, CURet and MBT. Results among various literature methods are compared, including deep convolutional neural networks with pre-trained architectures. The proposed method presented the highest overall performance over the 5 datasets, with 97.7 of mean accuracy against 97.0 achieved by the ResNet convolutional neural network with 50 layers. 
### 53.Generalizability vs. Robustness: Adversarial Examples for Medical  Imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00504.pdf)
> In this paper, for the first time, we propose an evaluation method for deep learning models that assesses the performance of a model not only in an unseen test scenario, but also in extreme cases of noise, outliers and ambiguous input data. To this end, we utilize adversarial examples, images that fool machine learning models, while looking imperceptibly different from original data, as a measure to evaluate the robustness of a variety of medical imaging models. Through extensive experiments on skin lesion classification and whole brain segmentation with state-of-the-art networks such as Inception and UNet, we show that models that achieve comparable performance regarding generalizability may have significant variations in their perception of the underlying data manifold, leading to an extensive performance gap in their robustness. 
### 54.Towards Explanation of DNN-based Prediction with Guided Feature  Inversion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00506.pdf)
> While deep neural networks (DNN) have become an effective computational tool, the prediction results are often criticized by the lack of interpretability, which is essential in many real-world applications such as health informatics. Existing attempts based on local interpretations aim to identify relevant features contributing the most to the prediction of DNN by monitoring the neighborhood of a given input. They usually simply ignore the intermediate layers of the DNN that might contain rich information for interpretation. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose to investigate a guided feature inversion framework for taking advantage of the deep architectures towards effective interpretation. The proposed framework not only determines the contribution of each feature in the input but also provides insights into the decision-making process of DNN models. By further interacting with the neuron of the target category at the output layer of the DNN, we enforce the interpretation result to be class-discriminative. We apply the proposed interpretation model to different CNN architectures to provide explanations for image data and conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and PASCAL VOC07 datasets. The interpretation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in providing class-discriminative interpretation for DNN-based prediction.

Then, a solution to this problem is presented using neural networks and autoencoders for the classification of American Sign Language images. As a result, 99.5% accuracy and an error of 0.01684 were obtained for image classification

In this work, the SqueezeNet DCNN is accelerated using an SoC FPGA in order for the offered object recognition resource to be employed in a robotic application. Experiments are conducted to investigate the performance and power consumption of the implementation in comparison to deployment on other widely-used computational systems. 
### 57.Towards Highly Accurate Coral Texture Images Classification Using Deep  Convolutional Neural Networks and Data Augmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00516.pdf)
> The recognition of coral species based on underwater texture images pose a significant difficulty for machine learning algorithms, due to the three following challenges embedded in the nature of this data: 1) datasets do not include information about the global structure of the coral; 2) several species of coral have very similar characteristics; and 3) defining the spatial borders between classes is difficult as many corals tend to appear together in groups. For this reason, the classification of coral species has always required an aid from a domain expert. The objective of this paper is to develop an accurate classification model for coral texture images. Current datasets contain a large number of imbalanced classes, while the images are subject to inter-class variation. We have analyzed 1) several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, 2) data augmentation techniques and 3) transfer learning. We have achieved the state-of-the art accuracies using different variations of ResNet on the two current coral texture datasets, EILAT and RSMAS. 
### 58.The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Benchmark: Object Detection and Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00518.pdf)
> With the advantage of high mobility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used to fuel numerous important applications in computer vision, delivering more efficiency and convenience than surveillance cameras with fixed camera angle, scale and view. However, very limited UAV datasets are proposed, and they focus only on a specific task such as visual tracking or object detection in relatively constrained scenarios. Consequently, it is of great importance to develop an unconstrained UAV benchmark to boost related researches. In this paper, we construct a new UAV benchmark focusing on complex scenarios with new level challenges. Selected from 10 hours raw videos, about 80,000 representative frames are fully annotated with bounding boxes as well as up to 14 kinds of attributes (e.g., weather condition, flying altitude, camera view, vehicle category, and occlusion) for three fundamental computer vision tasks: object detection, single object tracking, and multiple object tracking. Then, a detailed quantitative study is performed using most recent state-of-the-art algorithms for each task. Experimental results show that the current state-of-the-art methods perform relative worse on our dataset, due to the new challenges appeared in UAV based real scenes, e.g., high density, small object, and camera motion. To our knowledge, our work is the first time to explore such issues in unconstrained scenes comprehensively. 
### 59.CompNet: Complementary Segmentation Network for Brain MRI Extraction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00521.pdf)
> Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In this paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose complementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain from T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The proposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and have two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its complementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway extracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to brain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on the OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the two-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is verified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its invariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network design is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation problems with better generalization. 
### 60.DeepScores -- A Dataset for Segmentation, Detection and Classification  of Tiny Objects [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00525.pdf)
> We present the DeepScores dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in small objects recognition, and by placing the question of object recognition in the context of scene understanding. DeepScores contains high quality images of musical scores, partitioned into 300,000 sheets of written music that contain symbols of different shapes and sizes. With close to a hundred millions of small objects, this makes our dataset not only unique, but also the largest public dataset. DeepScores comes with ground truth for object classification, detection and semantic segmentation. DeepScores thus poses a relevant challenge for computer vision in general, beyond the scope of optical music recognition (OMR) research. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset, comparing it with other computer vision datasets like Caltech101/256, PASCAL VOC, SUN, SVHN, ImageNet, MS-COCO, smaller computer vision datasets, as well as with other OMR datasets. Finally, we provide baseline performances for object classification and give pointers to future research based on this dataset. 
### 61.A Neuronal Planar Modeling for Handwriting Signature based on Automatic  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00527.pdf)
> This paper deals with offline handwriting signature verification.We propose a planar neuronal model of signature image. Planarmodelsare generally based on delimiting homogenous zones ofimages; we propose in this paper an automatic segmentationapproach into bands of signature images. Signature image ismodeled by a planar neuronal model with horizontal secondarymodels and a verticalprincipal model. The proposed methodhas been tested on two databases. The first is the one we havecollected; it includes 6000 signaturescorresponding to 60writers. The second is the public GPDS-300 database including16200 signature corresponding to 300 persons. The achievedresults are promising. 
### 62.Multimodal Biometric Authentication Using Choquet Integral and Genetic  Algorithm [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00528.pdf)
> The Choquet integral is a tool for the information fusion that is very effective in the case where fuzzy measures associated with it are well chosen. In this paper,we propose a new approach for calculating fuzzy measures associated with the Choquet integral in a context of data fusion in multimodal biometrics. The proposed approach is based on genetic algorithms. It has been validated in two databases: the first base is relative to synthetic scores and the second one is biometrically relating to the face, fingerprintand palmprint. The results achieved attest the robustness of the proposed approach. 
### 63.Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Learning for Video Deblurring [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00533.pdf)
> Camera shake or target movement often leads to undesired blur effects in videos captured by a hand-held camera. Despite significant efforts having been devoted to video-deblur research, two major challenges remain: 1) how to model the spatio-temporal characteristics across both the spatial domain (i.e., image plane) and temporal domain (i.e., neighboring frames), and 2) how to restore sharp image details w.r.t. the conventionally adopted metric of pixel-wise errors. In this paper, to address the first challenge, we propose a DeBLuRring Network (DBLRNet) for spatial-temporal learning by applying a modified 3D convolution to both spatial and temporal domains. Our DBLRNet is able to capture jointly spatial and temporal information encoded in neighboring frames, which directly contributes to improved video deblur performance. To tackle the second challenge, we leverage the developed DBLRNet as a generator in the GAN (generative adversarial network) architecture, and employ a content loss in addition to an adversarial loss for efficient adversarial training. The developed network, which we name as DeBLuRring Generative Adversarial Network (DBLRGAN), is tested on two standard benchmarks and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. 
### 64.Learning Intrinsic Image Decomposition from Watching the World [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00582.pdf)
> Single-view intrinsic image decomposition is a highly ill-posed problem, and so a promising approach is to learn from large amounts of data. However, it is difficult to collect ground truth training data at scale for intrinsic images. In this paper, we explore a different approach to learning intrinsic images: observing image sequences over time depicting the same scene under changing illumination, and learning single-view decompositions that are consistent with these changes. This approach allows us to learn without ground truth decompositions, and to instead exploit information available from multiple images when training. Our trained model can then be applied at test time to single views. We describe a new learning framework based on this idea, including new loss functions that can be efficiently evaluated over entire sequences. While prior learning-based methods achieve good performance on specific benchmarks, we show that our approach generalizes well to several diverse datasets, including MIT intrinsic images, Intrinsic Images in the Wild and Shading Annotations in the Wild. 
### 65.Learning Descriptor Networks for 3D Shape Synthesis and Analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00586.pdf)
> This paper proposes a 3D shape descriptor network, which is a deep convolutional energy-based model, for modeling volumetric shape patterns. The maximum likelihood training of the model follows an "analysis by synthesis" scheme and can be interpreted as a mode seeking and mode shifting process. The model can synthesize 3D shape patterns by sampling from the probability distribution via MCMC such as Langevin dynamics. The model can be used to train a 3D generator network via MCMC teaching. The conditional version of the 3D shape descriptor net can be used for 3D object recovery and 3D object super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can generate realistic 3D shape patterns and can be useful for 3D shape analysis. 
### 66.MegaDepth: Learning Single-View Depth Prediction from Internet Photos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00607.pdf)
> Single-view depth prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Recently, deep learning methods have led to significant progress, but such methods are limited by the available training data. Current datasets based on 3D sensors have key limitations, including indoor-only images (NYU), small numbers of training examples (Make3D), and sparse sampling (KITTI). We propose to use multi-view Internet photo collections, a virtually unlimited data source, to generate training data via modern structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo (MVS) methods, and present a large depth dataset called MegaDepth based on this idea. Data derived from MVS comes with its own challenges, including noise and unreconstructable objects. We address these challenges with new data cleaning methods, as well as automatically augmenting our data with ordinal depth relations generated using semantic segmentation. We validate the use of large amounts of Internet data by showing that models trained on MegaDepth exhibit strong generalization-not only to novel scenes, but also to other diverse datasets including Make3D, KITTI, and DIW, even when no images from those datasets are seen during training. 
### 67.Updating the generator in PPGN-h with gradients flowing through the  encoder [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00630.pdf)
> The Generative Adversarial Network framework has shown success in implicitly modeling data distributions and is able to generate realistic samples. Its architecture is comprised of a generator, which produces fake data that superficially seem to belong to the real data distribution, and a discriminator which is to distinguish fake from genuine samples. The Noiseless Joint Plug &amp; Play model offers an extension to the framework by simultaneously training autoencoders. This model uses a pre-trained encoder as a feature extractor, feeding the generator with global information. Using the Plug &amp; Play network as baseline, we design a new model by adding discriminators to the Plug &amp; Play architecture. These additional discriminators are trained to discern real and fake latent codes, which are the output of the encoder using genuine and generated inputs, respectively. We proceed to investigate whether this approach is viable. Experiments conducted for the MNIST manifold show that this indeed is the case. 
### 68.3D Registration of Curves and Surfaces using Local Differential  Information [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00637.pdf)
> This article presents for the first time a global method for registering 3D curves with 3D surfaces without requiring an initialization. The algorithm works with 2-tuples point+vector that consist in pairs of points augmented with the information of their tangents or normals. A closed-form solution for determining the alignment transformation from a pair of matching 2-tuples is proposed. In addition, the set of necessary conditions for two 2-tuples to match is derived. This allows fast search of correspondences that are used in an hypothesise-and-test framework for accomplishing global registration. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is the first effective solution for curve vs surface registration, with the method achieving accurate alignment in situations of small overlap and large percentage of outliers in a fraction of a second. The proposed framework is extended to the cases of curve vs curve and surface vs surface registration, with the former being particularly relevant since it is also a largely unsolved problem. 
### 69.DeepMVS: Learning Multi-view Stereopsis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00650.pdf)
> We present DeepMVS, a deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for multi-view stereo reconstruction. Taking an arbitrary number of posed images as input, we first produce a set of plane-sweep volumes and use the proposed DeepMVS network to predict high-quality disparity maps. The key contributions that enable these results are (1) supervised pretraining on a photorealistic synthetic dataset, (2) an effective method for aggregating information across a set of unordered images, and (3) integrating multi-layer feature activations from the pre-trained VGG-19 network. We validate the efficacy of DeepMVS using the ETH3D Benchmark. Our results show that DeepMVS compares favorably against state-of-the-art conventional MVS algorithms and other ConvNet based methods, particularly for near-textureless regions and thin structures. 
### 70.Interactive Hand Pose Estimation: Boosting accuracy in localizing  extended finger joints [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00651.pdf)
> Accurate 3D hand pose estimation plays an important role in Human Machine Interaction (HMI). In the reality of HMI, joints in fingers stretching out, especially corresponding fingertips, are much more important than other joints. We propose a novel method to refine stretching-out finger joint locations after obtaining rough hand pose estimation. It first detects which fingers are stretching out, then neighbor pixels of certain joint vote for its new location based on random forests. The algorithm is tested on two public datasets: MSRA15 and ICVL. After the refinement stage of stretching-out fingers, errors of predicted HMI finger joint locations are significantly reduced. Mean error of all fingertips reduces around 5mm (relatively more than 20%). Stretching-out fingertip locations are even more precise, which in MSRA15 reduces 10.51mm (relatively 41.4%). 
### 71.Confidence from Invariance to Image Transformations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00657.pdf)
> We develop a technique for automatically detecting the classification errors of a pre-trained visual classifier. Our method is agnostic to the form of the classifier, requiring access only to classifier responses to a set of inputs. We train a parametric binary classifier (error/correct) on a representation derived from a set of classifier responses generated from multiple copies of the same input, each subject to a different natural image transformation. Thus, we establish a measure of confidence in classifier's decision by analyzing the invariance of its decision under various transformations. In experiments with multiple data sets (STL-10,CIFAR-100,ImageNet) and classifiers, we demonstrate new state of the art for the error detection task. In addition, we apply our technique to novelty detection scenarios, where we also demonstrate state of the art results. 
### 72.Hierarchical Novelty Detection for Visual Object Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00722.pdf)
> Deep neural networks have achieved impressive success in large-scale visual object recognition tasks with a predefined set of classes. However, recognizing objects of novel classes unseen during training still remains challenging. The problem of detecting such novel classes has been addressed in the literature, but most prior works have focused on providing simple binary or regressive decisions, e.g., the output would be "known," "novel," or corresponding confidence intervals. In this paper, we study more informative novelty detection schemes based on a hierarchical classification framework. For an object of a novel class, we aim for finding its closest super class in the hierarchical taxonomy of known classes. To this end, we propose two different approaches termed top-down and flatten methods, and their combination as well. The essential ingredients of our methods are confidence-calibrated classifiers, data relabeling, and the leave-one-out strategy for modeling novel classes under the hierarchical taxonomy. Furthermore, our method can generate a hierarchical embedding that leads to improved generalized zero-shot learning performance in combination with other commonly-used semantic embeddings. 
### 73.Improved Fusion of Visual and Language Representations by Dense  Symmetric Co-Attention for Visual Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00775.pdf)
> A key solution to visual question answering (VQA) exists in how to fuse visual and language features extracted from an input image and question. We show that an attention mechanism that enables dense, bi-directional interactions between the two modalities contributes to boost accuracy of prediction of answers. Specifically, we present a simple architecture that is fully symmetric between visual and language representations, in which each question word attends on image regions and each image region attends on question words. It can be stacked to form a hierarchy for multi-step interactions between an image-question pair. We show through experiments that the proposed architecture achieves a new state-of-the-art on VQA and VQA 2.0 despite its small size. We also present qualitative evaluation, demonstrating how the proposed attention mechanism can generate reasonable attention maps on images and questions, which leads to the correct answer prediction. 
### 74.3D Interpreter Networks for Viewer-Centered Wireframe Modeling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00782.pdf)
> Understanding 3D object structure from a single image is an important but challenging task in computer vision, mostly due to the lack of 3D object annotations to real images. Previous research tackled this problem by either searching for a 3D shape that best explains 2D annotations, or training purely on synthetic data with ground truth 3D information. In this work, we propose 3D INterpreter Networks (3D-INN), an end-to-end trainable framework that sequentially estimates 2D keypoint heatmaps and 3D object skeletons and poses. Our system learns from both 2D-annotated real images and synthetic 3D data. This is made possible mainly by two technical innovations. First, heatmaps of 2D keypoints serve as an intermediate representation to connect real and synthetic data. 3D-INN is trained on real images to estimate 2D keypoint heatmaps from an input image; it then predicts 3D object structure from heatmaps using knowledge learned from synthetic 3D shapes. By doing so, 3D-INN benefits from the variation and abundance of synthetic 3D objects, without suffering from the domain difference between real and synthesized images, often due to imperfect rendering. Second, we propose a Projection Layer, mapping estimated 3D structure back to 2D. During training, it ensures 3D-INN to predict 3D structure whose projection is consistent with the 2D annotations to real images. Experiments show that the proposed system performs well on both 2D keypoint estimation and 3D structure recovery. We also demonstrate that the recovered 3D information has wide vision applications, such as image retrieval. 
### 75.Multi-Scale Spatially-Asymmetric Recalibration for Image Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00787.pdf)
> Convolution is spatially-symmetric, i.e., the visual features are independent of its position in the image, which limits its ability to utilize contextual cues for visual recognition. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a recalibration process, which refers to the surrounding region of each neuron, computes an importance value and multiplies it to the original neural response. Our approach is named multi-scale spatially-asymmetric recalibration (MS-SAR), which extracts visual cues from surrounding regions at multiple scales, and designs a weighting scheme which is asymmetric in the spatial domain. MS-SAR is implemented in an efficient way, so that only small fractions of extra parameters and computations are required. We apply MS-SAR to several popular building blocks, including the residual block and the densely-connected block, and demonstrate its superior performance in both CIFAR and ILSVRC2012 classification tasks. 
### 76.Left-Right Comparative Recurrent Model for Stereo Matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00796.pdf)
> Leveraging the disparity information from both left and right views is crucial for stereo disparity estimation. Left-right consistency check is an effective way to enhance the disparity estimation by referring to the information from the opposite view. However, the conventional left-right consistency check is an isolated post-processing step and heavily hand-crafted. This paper proposes a novel left-right comparative recurrent model to perform left-right consistency checking jointly with disparity estimation. At each recurrent step, the model produces disparity results for both views, and then performs online left-right comparison to identify the mismatched regions which may probably contain erroneously labeled pixels. A soft attention mechanism is introduced, which employs the learned error maps for better guiding the model to selectively focus on refining the unreliable regions at the next recurrent step. In this way, the generated disparity maps are progressively improved by the proposed recurrent model. Extensive evaluations on KITTI 2015, Scene Flow and Middlebury benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our model, demonstrating that state-of-the-art stereo disparity estimation results can be achieved by this new model. 
### 77.End-to-End Dense Video Captioning with Masked Transformer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00819.pdf)
> Dense video captioning aims to generate text descriptions for all events in an untrimmed video. This involves both detecting and describing events. Therefore, all previous methods on dense video captioning tackle this problem by building two models, i.e. an event proposal and a captioning model, for these two sub-problems. The models are either trained separately or in alternation. This prevents direct influence of the language description to the event proposal, which is important for generating accurate descriptions. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end transformer model for dense video captioning. The encoder encodes the video into appropriate representations. The proposal decoder decodes from the encoding with different anchors to form video event proposals. The captioning decoder employs a masking network to restrict its attention to the proposal event over the encoding feature. This masking network converts the event proposal to a differentiable mask, which ensures the consistency between the proposal and captioning during training. In addition, our model employs a self-attention mechanism, which enables the use of efficient non-recurrent structure during encoding and leads to performance improvements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this end-to-end model on ActivityNet Captions and YouCookII datasets, where we achieved 10.12 and 6.58 METEOR score, respectively. 
### 78.Prediction and Localization of Student Engagement in the Wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00858.pdf)
> In this paper, we introduce a new dataset for student engagement detection and localization. Digital revolution has transformed the traditional teaching procedure and a result analysis of the student engagement in an e-learning environment would facilitate effective task accomplishment and learning. Well known social cues of engagement/disengagement can be inferred from facial expressions, body movements and gaze pattern. In this paper, student's response to various stimuli videos are recorded and important cues are extracted to estimate variations in engagement level. In this paper, we study the association of a subject's behavioral cues with his/her engagement level, as annotated by labelers. We then localize engaging/non-engaging parts in the stimuli videos using a deep multiple instance learning based framework, which can give useful insight into designing Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) video material. Recognizing the lack of any publicly available dataset in the domain of user engagement, a new `in the wild' dataset is created to study the subject engagement problem. The dataset contains 195 videos captured from 78 subjects which is about 16.5 hours of recording. We present detailed baseline results using different classifiers ranging from traditional machine learning to deep learning based approaches. The subject independent analysis is performed so that it can be generalized to new users. The problem of engagement prediction is modeled as a weakly supervised learning problem. The dataset is manually annotated by different labelers for four levels of engagement independently and the correlation studies between annotated and predicted labels of videos by different classifiers is reported. This dataset creation is an effort to facilitate research in various e-learning environments such as intelligent tutoring systems, MOOCs, and others. 
### 79.Generating Diverse and Accurate Visual Captions by Comparative  Adversarial Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00861.pdf)
> We study how to generate captions that are not only accurate in describing an image but also discriminative across different images. The problem is both fundamental and interesting, as most machine-generated captions, despite phenomenal research progresses in the past several years, are expressed in a very monotonic and featureless format. While such captions are normally accurate, they often lack important characteristics in human languages - distinctiveness for each caption and diversity for different images. To address this problem, we propose a novel conditional generative adversarial network for generating diverse captions across images. Instead of estimating the quality of a caption solely on one image, the proposed comparative adversarial learning framework better assesses the quality of captions by comparing a set of captions within the image-caption joint space. By contrasting with human-written captions and image-mismatched captions, the caption generator effectively exploits the inherent characteristics of human languages, and generates more discriminative captions. We show that our proposed network is capable of producing accurate and diverse captions across images. 
### 80.Deep Appearance Maps [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00863.pdf)
> We propose a deep representation of appearance, i. e. the relation of color, surface orientation, viewer position, material and illumination. Previous approaches have used deep learning to extract classic appearance representations relating to reflectance model parameters (e. g. Phong) or illumination (e. g. HDR environment maps). We suggest to directly represent appearance itself as a network we call a deep appearance map (DAM). This is a 4D generalization over 2D reflectance maps, which held the view direction fixed. First, we show how a DAM can be learned from images or video frames and later be used to synthesize appearance, given new surface orientations and viewer positions. Second, we demonstrate how another network can be used to map from an image or video frames to a DAM network to reproduce this appearance, without using a lengthy optimization such as stochastic gradient descent (learning-to-learn). Finally, we generalize this to an appearance estimation-and-segmentation task, where we map from an image showing multiple materials to multiple networks reproducing their appearance, as well as per-pixel segmentation. 
### 81.Exploring Multi-Branch and High-Level Semantic Networks for Improving  Pedestrian Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00872.pdf)
> To better detect pedestrians of various scales, deep multi-scale methods usually detect pedestrians of different scales by different in-network layers. However, the semantic levels of features from different layers are usually inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a multi-branch and high-level semantic network by gradually splitting a base network into multiple different branches. As a result, the different branches have the same depth and the output features of different branches have similarly high-level semantics. Due to the difference of receptive fields, the different branches are suitable to detect pedestrians of different scales. Meanwhile, the multi-branch network does not introduce additional parameters by sharing convolutional weights of different branches. To further improve detection performance, skip-layer connections among different branches are used to add context to the branch of relatively small receptive filed, and dilated convolution is incorporated into part branches to enlarge the resolutions of output feature maps. When they are embedded into Faster RCNN architecture, the weighted scores of proposal generation network and proposal classification network are further proposed. Experiments on KITTI dataset, Caltech pedestrian dataset, and Citypersons dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. On these pedestrian datasets, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance. Moreover, experiments on COCO benchmark show the proposed method is also suitable for general object detection. 
### 82.CodeSLAM - Learning a Compact, Optimisable Representation for Dense  Visual SLAM [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00874.pdf)
> The representation of geometry in real-time 3D perception systems continues to be a critical research issue. Dense maps capture complete surface shape and can be augmented with semantic labels, but their high dimensionality makes them computationally costly to store and process, and unsuitable for rigorous probabilistic inference. Sparse feature-based representations avoid these problems, but capture only partial scene information and are mainly useful for localisation only. <br />We present a new compact but dense representation of scene geometry which is conditioned on the intensity data from a single image and generated from a code consisting of a small number of parameters. We are inspired by work both on learned depth from images, and auto-encoders. Our approach is suitable for use in a keyframe-based monocular dense SLAM system: While each keyframe with a code can produce a depth map, the code can be optimised efficiently jointly with pose variables and together with the codes of overlapping keyframes to attain global consistency. Conditioning the depth map on the image allows the code to only represent aspects of the local geometry which cannot directly be predicted from the image. We explain how to learn our code representation, and demonstrate its advantageous properties in monocular SLAM. 
### 83.Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation using Class Peak Response [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00880.pdf)
> Weakly supervised instance segmentation with image-level labels, instead of expensive pixel-level masks, remains unexplored. In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem by exploiting class peak responses to enable a classification network for instance mask extraction. With image labels supervision only, CNN classifiers in a fully convolutional manner can produce class response maps, which specify classification confidence at each image location. We observed that local maximums, i.e., peaks, in a class response map typically correspond to strong visual cues residing inside each instance. Motivated by this, we first design a process to stimulate peaks to emerge from a class response map. The emerged peaks are then back-propagated and effectively mapped to highly informative regions of each object instance, such as instance boundaries. We refer to the above maps generated from class peak responses as Peak Response Maps (PRMs). PRMs provide a fine-detailed instance-level representation, which allows instance masks to be extracted even with some off-the-shelf methods. To the best of our knowledge, we for the first time report results for the challenging image-level supervised instance segmentation task. Extensive experiments show that our method also boosts weakly supervised pointwise localization as well as semantic segmentation performance, and reports state-of-the-art results on popular benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO. 
### 84.PhaseNet for Video Frame Interpolation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00884.pdf)
> Most approaches for video frame interpolation require accurate dense correspondences to synthesize an in-between frame. Therefore, they do not perform well in challenging scenarios with e.g. lighting changes or motion blur. Recent deep learning approaches that rely on kernels to represent motion can only alleviate these problems to some extent. In those cases, methods that use a per-pixel phase-based motion representation have been shown to work well. However, they are only applicable for a limited amount of motion. We propose a new approach, PhaseNet, that is designed to robustly handle challenging scenarios while also coping with larger motion. Our approach consists of a neural network decoder that directly estimates the phase decomposition of the intermediate frame. We show that this is superior to the hand-crafted heuristics previously used in phase-based methods and also compares favorably to recent deep learning based approaches for video frame interpolation on challenging datasets. 
### 85.Learning to Guide Decoding for Image Captioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00887.pdf)
> Recently, much advance has been made in image captioning, and an encoder-decoder framework has achieved outstanding performance for this task. In this paper, we propose an extension of the encoder-decoder framework by adding a component called guiding network. The guiding network models the attribute properties of input images, and its output is leveraged to compose the input of the decoder at each time step. The guiding network can be plugged into the current encoder-decoder framework and trained in an end-to-end manner. Hence, the guiding vector can be adaptively learned according to the signal from the decoder, making itself to embed information from both image and language. Additionally, discriminative supervision can be employed to further improve the quality of guidance. The advantages of our proposed approach are verified by experiments carried out on the MS COCO dataset. 
### 86.When will you do what? - Anticipating Temporal Occurrences of Activities [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00892.pdf)
> Analyzing human actions in videos has gained increased attention recently. While most works focus on classifying and labeling observed video frames or anticipating the very recent future, making long-term predictions over more than just a few seconds is a task with many practical applications that has not yet been addressed. In this paper, we propose two methods to predict a considerably large amount of future actions and their durations. Both, a CNN and an RNN are trained to learn future video labels based on previously seen content. We show that our methods generate accurate predictions of the future even for long videos with a huge amount of different actions and can even deal with noisy or erroneous input information. 
### 87.Towards whole-body CT Bone Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00908.pdf)
> Bone segmentation from CT images is a task that has been worked on for decades. It is an important ingredient to several diagnostics or treatment planning approaches and relevant to various diseases. As high-quality manual and semi-automatic bone segmentation is very time-consuming, a reliable and fully automatic approach would be of great interest in many scenarios. In this publication, we propose a UNet inspired architecture to address the task using Deep Learning. We evaluated the approach on whole-body CT scans of patients suffering from multiple myeloma. As the disease decomposes the bone, an accurate segmentation is of utmost importance for the evaluation of bone density, disease staging and localization of focal lesions. The method was evaluated on an in-house data-set of 6000 2D image slices taken from 15 whole-body CT scans, achieving a dice score of 0.96 and an IOU of 0.94. 
### 88.Dynamic Video Segmentation Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00931.pdf)
> In this paper, we present a detailed design of dynamic video segmentation network (DVSNet) for fast and efficient semantic video segmentation. DVSNet consists of two convolutional neural networks: a segmentation network and a flow network. The former generates highly accurate semantic segmentations, but is deeper and slower. The latter is much faster than the former, but its output requires further processing to generate less accurate semantic segmentations. We explore the use of a decision network to adaptively assign different frame regions to different networks based on a metric called expected confidence score. Frame regions with a higher expected confidence score traverse the flow network. Frame regions with a lower expected confidence score have to pass through the segmentation network. We have extensively performed experiments on various configurations of DVSNet, and investigated a number of variants for the proposed decision network. The experimental results show that our DVSNet is able to achieve up to 70.4% mIoU at 19.8 fps on the Cityscape dataset. A high speed version of DVSNet is able to deliver an fps of 30.4 with 63.2% mIoU on the same dataset. DVSNet is also able to reduce up to 95% of the computational workloads. 
### 89.Unsupervised Learning of Sequence Representations by Autoencoders [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00946.pdf)
> Sequence data is challenging for machine learning approaches, because the lengths of the sequences may vary between samples. In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning model for sequence data, called the Integrated Sequence Autoencoder (ISA), to learn a fixed-length vectorial representation by minimizing the reconstruction error. Specifically, we propose to integrate two classical mechanisms for sequence reconstruction which takes into account both the global silhouette information and the local temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose a stop feature that serves as a temporal stamp to guide the reconstruction process, which results in a higher-quality representation. The learned representation is able to effectively summarize not only the apparent features, but also the underlying and high-level style information. Take for example a speech sequence sample: our ISA model can not only recognize the spoken text (apparent feature), but can also discriminate the speaker who utters the audio (more high-level style). One promising application of the ISA model is that it can be readily used in the semi-supervised learning scenario, in which a large amount of unlabeled data is leveraged to extract high-quality sequence representations and thus to improve the performance of the subsequent supervised learning tasks on limited labeled data. 
### 90.Face Alignment in Full Pose Range: A 3D Total Solution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01005.pdf)
> Face alignment, which fits a face model to an image and extracts the semantic meanings of facial pixels, has been an important topic in the computer vision community. However, most algorithms are designed for faces in small to medium poses (yaw angle is smaller than 45 degrees), which lack the ability to align faces in large poses up to 90 degrees. The challenges are three-fold. Firstly, the commonly used landmark face model assumes that all the landmarks are visible and is therefore not suitable for large poses. Secondly, the face appearance varies more drastically across large poses, from the frontal view to the profile view. Thirdly, labelling landmarks in large poses is extremely challenging since the invisible landmarks have to be guessed. In this paper, we propose to tackle these three challenges in an new alignment framework termed 3D Dense Face Alignment (3DDFA), in which a dense 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is fitted to the image via Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks. We also utilize 3D information to synthesize face images in profile views to provide abundant samples for training. Experiments on the challenging AFLW database show that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 91.DOCK: Detecting Objects by transferring Common-sense Knowledge [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01077.pdf)
> We present a scalable approach for Detecting Objects by transferring Common-sense Knowledge (DOCK) from source to target categories. In our setting, the training data for the source categories have bounding box annotations, while those for the target categories only have image-level annotations. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on image-level visual or semantic similarity to adapt a detector trained on the source categories to the new target categories. In contrast, our key idea is to (i) use similarity not at the image-level, but rather at the region-level, and (ii) leverage richer common-sense (based on attribute, spatial, etc.) to guide the algorithm towards learning the correct detections. We acquire such common-sense cues automatically from readily-available knowledge bases without any extra human effort. On the challenging MS COCO dataset, we find that common-sense knowledge can substantially improve detection performance over existing transfer-learning baselines. 
### 92.Unsupervised Geometry-Aware Representation for 3D Human Pose Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01110.pdf)
> Modern 3D human pose estimation techniques rely on deep networks, which require large amounts of training data. While weakly-supervised methods require less supervision, by utilizing 2D poses or multi-view imagery without annotations, they still need a sufficiently large set of samples with 3D annotations for learning to succeed. <br />In this paper, we propose to overcome this problem by learning a geometry-aware body representation from multi-view images without annotations. To this end, we use an encoder-decoder that predicts an image from one viewpoint given an image from another viewpoint. Because this representation encodes 3D geometry, using it in a semi-supervised setting makes it easier to learn a mapping from it to 3D human pose. As evidenced by our experiments, our approach significantly outperforms fully-supervised methods given the same amount of labeled data, and improves over other semi-supervised methods while using as little as 1% of the labeled data. 
### 93.Visual Object Categorization Based on Hierarchical Shape Motifs Learned  From Noisy Point Cloud Decompositions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01117.pdf)
> Object shape is a key cue that contributes to the semantic understanding of objects. In this work we focus on the categorization of real-world object point clouds to particular shape types. Therein surface description and representation of object shape structure have significant influence on shape categorization accuracy, when dealing with real-world scenes featuring noisy, partial and occluded object observations. An unsupervised hierarchical learning procedure is utilized here to symbolically describe surface characteristics on multiple semantic levels. Furthermore, a constellation model is proposed that hierarchically decomposes objects. The decompositions are described as constellations of symbols (shape motifs) in a gradual order, hence reflecting shape structure from local to global, i.e., from parts over groups of parts to entire objects. The combination of this multi-level description of surfaces and the hierarchical decomposition of shapes leads to a representation which allows to conceptualize shapes. An object discrimination has been observed in experiments with seven categories featuring instances with sensor noise, occlusions as well as inter-category and intra-category similarities. Experiments include the evaluation of the proposed description and shape decomposition approach, and comparisons to Fast Point Feature Histograms, a Vocabulary Tree and a neural network-based Deep Learning method. Furthermore, experiments are conducted with alternative datasets which analyze the generalization capability of the proposed approach. 
### 94.Synthesizing Programs for Images using Reinforced Adversarial Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01118.pdf)
> Advances in deep generative networks have led to impressive results in recent years. Nevertheless, such models can often waste their capacity on the minutiae of datasets, presumably due to weak inductive biases in their decoders. This is where graphics engines may come in handy since they abstract away low-level details and represent images as high-level programs. Current methods that combine deep learning and renderers are limited by hand-crafted likelihood or distance functions, a need for large amounts of supervision, or difficulties in scaling their inference algorithms to richer datasets. To mitigate these issues, we present SPIRAL, an adversarially trained agent that generates a program which is executed by a graphics engine to interpret and sample images. The goal of this agent is to fool a discriminator network that distinguishes between real and rendered data, trained with a distributed reinforcement learning setup without any supervision. A surprising finding is that using the discriminator's output as a reward signal is the key to allow the agent to make meaningful progress at matching the desired output rendering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an end-to-end, unsupervised and adversarial inverse graphics agent on challenging real world (MNIST, Omniglot, CelebA) and synthetic 3D datasets. 
### 95.A Modified Image Comparison Algorithm Using Histogram Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01142.pdf)
> This article discuss the problem of color image content comparison. Particularly, methods of image content comparison are analyzed, restrictions of color histogram are described and a modified method of images content comparison is proposed. This method uses the color histograms and considers color locations. Testing and analyzing of based and modified algorithms are performed. The modified method shows 97% average precision for a collection containing about 700 images without loss of the advantages of based method, i.e. scale and rotation invariant. 
### 96.Crystal Loss and Quality Pooling for Unconstrained Face Verification and  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01159.pdf)
> In recent years, the performance of face verification and recognition systems based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) has significantly improved. A typical pipeline for face verification includes training a deep network for subject classification with softmax loss, using the penultimate layer output as the feature descriptor, and generating a cosine similarity score given a pair of face images or videos. The softmax loss function does not optimize the features to have higher similarity score for positive pairs and lower similarity score for negative pairs, which leads to a performance gap. In this paper, we propose a new loss function, called Crystal Loss, that restricts the features to lie on a hypersphere of a fixed radius. The loss can be easily implemented using existing deep learning frameworks. We show that integrating this simple step in the training pipeline significantly improves the performance of face verification and recognition systems. We achieve state-of-the-art performance for face verification and recognition on challenging LFW, IJB-A, IJB-B and IJB-C datasets over a large range of false alarm rates (10-1 to 10-7). 
### 97.Towards Deep Learning based Hand Keypoints Detection for Rapid  Sequential Movements from RGB Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01174.pdf)
> Hand keypoints detection and pose estimation has numerous applications in computer vision, but it is still an unsolved problem in many aspects. An application of hand keypoints detection is in performing cognitive assessments of a subject by observing the performance of that subject in physical tasks involving rapid finger motion. As a part of this work, we introduce a novel hand key-points benchmark dataset that consists of hand gestures recorded specifically for cognitive behavior monitoring. We explore the state of the art methods in hand keypoint detection and we provide quantitative evaluations for the performance of these methods on our dataset. In future, these results and our dataset can serve as a useful benchmark for hand keypoint recognition for rapid finger movements. 
### 98.Depth Pooling Based Large-scale 3D Action Recognition with Convolutional  Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01194.pdf)
> This paper proposes three simple, compact yet effective representations of depth sequences, referred to respectively as Dynamic Depth Images (DDI), Dynamic Depth Normal Images (DDNI) and Dynamic Depth Motion Normal Images (DDMNI), for both isolated and continuous action recognition. These dynamic images are constructed from a segmented sequence of depth maps using hierarchical bidirectional rank pooling to effectively capture the spatial-temporal information. Specifically, DDI exploits the dynamics of postures over time and DDNI and DDMNI exploit the 3D structural information captured by depth maps. Upon the proposed representations, a ConvNet based method is developed for action recognition. The image-based representations enable us to fine-tune the existing Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) models trained on image data without training a large number of parameters from scratch. The proposed method achieved the state-of-art results on three large datasets, namely, the Large-scale Continuous Gesture Recognition Dataset (means Jaccard index 0.4109), the Large-scale Isolated Gesture Recognition Dataset (59.21%), and the NTU RGB+D Dataset (87.08% cross-subject and 84.22% cross-view) even though only the depth modality was used. 
### 99.A Segmentation-aware Deep Fusion Network for Compressed Sensing MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01210.pdf)
> Compressed sensing MRI is a classic inverse problem in the field of computational imaging, accelerating the MR imaging by measuring less k-space data. The deep neural network models provide the stronger representation ability and faster reconstruction compared with "shallow" optimization-based methods. However, in the existing deep-based CS-MRI models, the high-level semantic supervision information from massive segmentation-labels in MRI dataset is overlooked. In this paper, we proposed a segmentation-aware deep fusion network called SADFN for compressed sensing MRI. The multilayer feature aggregation (MLFA) method is introduced here to fuse all the features from different layers in the segmentation network. Then, the aggregated feature maps containing semantic information are provided to each layer in the reconstruction network with a feature fusion strategy. This guarantees the reconstruction network is aware of the different regions in the image it reconstructs, simplifying the function mapping. We prove the utility of the cross-layer and cross-task information fusion strategy by comparative study. Extensive experiments on brain segmentation benchmark MRBrainS validated that the proposed SADFN model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in compressed sensing MRI. This paper provides a novel approach to guide the low-level visual task using the information from mid- or high-level task. 
### 100.Self-Supervised Adversarial Hashing Networks for Cross-Modal Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01223.pdf)
> Thanks to the success of deep learning, cross-modal retrieval has made significant progress recently. However, there still remains a crucial bottleneck: how to bridge the modality gap to further enhance the retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised adversarial hashing (\textbf{SSAH}) approach, which lies among the early attempts to incorporate adversarial learning into cross-modal hashing in a self-supervised fashion. The primary contribution of this work is that two adversarial networks are leveraged to maximize the semantic correlation and consistency of the representations between different modalities. In addition, we harness a self-supervised semantic network to discover high-level semantic information in the form of multi-label annotations. Such information guides the feature learning process and preserves the modality relationships in both the common semantic space and the Hamming space. Extensive experiments carried out on three benchmark datasets validate that the proposed SSAH surpasses the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 101.Discriminative Cross-View Binary Representation Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01233.pdf)
> Learning compact representation is vital and challenging for large scale multimedia data. Cross-view/cross-modal hashing for effective binary representation learning has received significant attention with exponentially growing availability of multimedia content. Most existing cross-view hashing algorithms emphasize the similarities in individual views, which are then connected via cross-view similarities. In this work, we focus on the exploitation of the discriminative information from different views, and propose an end-to-end method to learn semantic-preserving and discriminative binary representation, dubbed Discriminative Cross-View Hashing (DCVH), in light of learning multitasking binary representation for various tasks including cross-view retrieval, image-to-image retrieval, and image annotation/tagging. The proposed DCVH has the following key components. First, it uses convolutional neural network (CNN) based nonlinear hashing functions and multilabel classification for both images and texts simultaneously. Such hashing functions achieve effective continuous relaxation during training without explicit quantization loss by using Direct Binary Embedding (DBE) layers. Second, we propose an effective view alignment via Hamming distance minimization, which is efficiently accomplished by bit-wise XOR operation. Extensive experiments on two image-text benchmark datasets demonstrate that DCVH outperforms state-of-the-art cross-view hashing algorithms as well as single-view image hashing algorithms. In addition, DCVH can provide competitive performance for image annotation/tagging. 
### 102.Building Efficient CNN Architecture for Offline Handwritten Chinese  Character Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01259.pdf)
> Deep convolutional networks based methods have brought great breakthrough in images classification, which provides an end-to-end solution for handwritten Chinese character recognition(HCCR) problem through learning discriminative features automatically. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art CNNs appear to incur huge computation cost, and require the storage of a large number of parameters especially in fully connected layers, which is difficult to deploy such networks into alternative hardware device with the limit of computation amount. To solve the storage problem, we propose a novel technique called Global Weighted Arverage Pooling for reducing the parameters in fully connected layer without loss in accuracy. Besides, we implement a cascaded model in single CNN by adding mid output layer to complete recognition as early as possible, which reduces average inference time significantly. Experiments were performed on the ICDAR-2013 offline HCCR dataset, and it is found that the proposed approach only needs 6.9ms for classfying a chracter image on average, and achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 97.1% while requiring only 3.3MB for storage. 
### 103.Gaussian Process Uncertainty in Age Estimation as a Measure of Brain  Abnormality [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01296.pdf)
> Multivariate regression models for age estimation are a powerful tool for assessing abnormal brain morphology associated to neuropathology. Age prediction models are built on cohorts of healthy subjects and are built to reflect normal aging patterns. The application of these multivariate models to diseased subjects usually results in high prediction errors, under the hypothesis that neuropathology presents a similar degenerative pattern as that of accelerated aging. In this work, we propose an alternative to the idea that pathology follows a similar trajectory than normal aging. Instead, we propose the use of metrics which measure deviations from the mean aging trajectory. We propose to measure these deviations using two different metrics: uncertainty in a Gaussian process regression model and a newly proposed age weighted uncertainty measure. Consequently, our approach assumes that pathologic brain patterns are different to those of normal aging. We present results for subjects with autism, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease to highlight the versatility of the approach to different diseases and age ranges. We evaluate volume, thickness, and VBM features for quantifying brain morphology. Our evaluations are performed on a large number of images obtained from a variety of publicly available neuroimaging databases. Across all features, our uncertainty based measurements yield a better separation between diseased subjects and healthy individuals than the prediction error. Finally, we illustrate differences in the disease pattern to normal aging, supporting the application of uncertainty as a measure of neuropathology. 
### 104.A Unifying Contrast Maximization Framework for Event Cameras, with  Applications to Motion, Depth, and Optical Flow Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01306.pdf)
> We present a unifying framework to solve several computer vision problems with event cameras: motion, depth and optical flow estimation. The main idea of our framework is to find the point trajectories on the image plane that are best aligned with the event data by maximizing an objective function: the contrast of an image of warped events. Our method implicitly handles data association between the events, and therefore, does not rely on additional appearance information about the scene. In addition to accurately recovering the motion parameters of the problem, our framework produces motion-corrected edge-like images with high dynamic range that can be used for further scene analysis. The proposed method is not only simple, but more importantly, it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that can be successfully applied to such a diverse set of important vision tasks with event cameras. 
### 105.Btrfly Net: Vertebrae Labelling with Energy-based Adversarial Learning  of Local Spine Prior [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01307.pdf)
> Robust localisation and identification of vertebrae is an essential part of automated spine analysis. The contribution of this work to the task is two-fold: (1) Inspired by the human expert, we hypothesise that a sagittal and coronal reformation of the spine contain sufficient information for labelling the vertebrae. Thereby, we propose a butterfly-shaped network architecture (termed Btrfly Net) that efficiently combines the information across the reformations. (2) Underpinning the Btrfly net, we present an energy-based adversarial training regime that encodes the local spine structure as an anatomical prior into the network, thereby enabling it to achieve state-of-art performance in all standard metrics on a benchmark dataset of 302 scans without any post-processing during inference. 
### 106.Event-based Vision meets Deep Learning on Steering Prediction for  Self-driving Cars [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01310.pdf)
> Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that naturally capture the dynamics of a scene, filtering out redundant information. This paper presents a deep neural network approach that unlocks the potential of event cameras on a challenging motion-estimation task: prediction of a vehicle's steering angle. To make the best out of this sensor-algorithm combination, we adapt state-of-the-art convolutional architectures to the output of event sensors and extensively evaluate the performance of our approach on a publicly available large scale event-camera dataset (~1000 km). We present qualitative and quantitative explanations of why event cameras allow robust steering prediction even in cases where traditional cameras fail, e.g. challenging illumination conditions and fast motion. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of leveraging transfer learning from traditional to event-based vision, and show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms based on standard cameras. 
### 107.A Multi-Stage Multi-Task Neural Network for Aerial Scene Interpretation  and Geolocalization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01322.pdf)
> Semantic segmentation and vision-based geolocalization in aerial images are challenging tasks in computer vision. Due to the advent of deep convolutional nets and the availability of relatively low cost UAVs, they are currently generating a growing attention in the field. We propose a novel multi-task multi-stage neural network that is able to handle the two problems at the same time, in a single forward pass. The first stage of our network predicts pixelwise class labels, while the second stage provides a precise location using two branches. One branch uses a regression network, while the other is used to predict a location map trained as a segmentation task. From a structural point of view, our architecture uses encoder-decoder modules at each stage, having the same encoder structure re-used. Furthermore, its size is limited to be tractable on an embedded GPU. We achieve commercial GPS-level localization accuracy from satellite images with spatial resolution of 1 square meter per pixel in a city-wide area of interest. On the task of semantic segmentation, we obtain state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets, the Inria Aerial Image Labeling dataset and Massachusetts Buildings. 
### 108.Normalized Cut Loss for Weakly-supervised CNN Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01346.pdf)
> Most recent semantic segmentation methods train deep convolutional neural networks with fully annotated masks requiring pixel-accuracy for good quality training. Common weakly-supervised approaches generate full masks from partial input (e.g. scribbles or seeds) using standard interactive segmentation methods as preprocessing. But, errors in such masks result in poorer training since standard loss functions (e.g. cross-entropy) do not distinguish seeds from potentially mislabeled other pixels. Inspired by the general ideas in semi-supervised learning, we address these problems via a new principled loss function evaluating network output with criteria standard in "shallow" segmentation, e.g. normalized cut. Unlike prior work, the cross entropy part of our loss evaluates only seeds where labels are known while normalized cut softly evaluates consistency of all pixels. We focus on normalized cut loss where dense Gaussian kernel is efficiently implemented in linear time by fast Bilateral filtering. Our normalized cut loss approach to segmentation brings the quality of weakly-supervised training significantly closer to fully supervised methods. 
### 109.Fine-grained Video Attractiveness Prediction Using Multimodal Deep  Learning on a Large Real-world Dataset [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01373.pdf)
> Nowadays, billions of videos are online ready to be viewed and shared. Among an enormous volume of videos, some popular ones are widely viewed by online users while the majority attract little attention. Furthermore, within each video, different segments may attract significantly different numbers of views. This phenomenon leads to a challenging yet important problem, namely fine-grained video attractiveness prediction. However, one major obstacle for such a challenging problem is that no suitable benchmark dataset currently exists. To this end, we construct the first fine-grained video attractiveness dataset, which is collected from one of the most popular video websites in the world. In total, the constructed FVAD consists of 1,019 drama episodes with 780.6 hours covering different categories and a wide variety of video contents. Apart from the large amount of videos, hundreds of millions of user behaviors during watching videos are also included, such as "view counts", "fast-forward", "fast-rewind", and so on, where "view counts" reflects the video attractiveness while other engagements capture the interactions between the viewers and videos. First, we demonstrate that video attractiveness and different engagements present different relationships. Second, FVAD provides us an opportunity to study the fine-grained video attractiveness prediction problem. We design different sequential models to perform video attractiveness prediction by relying solely on video contents. The sequential models exploit the multimodal relationships between visual and audio components of the video contents at different levels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed sequential models with different visual and audio representations, the necessity of incorporating the two modalities, and the complementary behaviors of the sequential prediction models at different levels. 
### 110.SketchMate: Deep Hashing for Million-Scale Human Sketch Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01401.pdf)
> We propose a deep hashing framework for sketch retrieval that, for the first time, works on a multi-million scale human sketch dataset. Leveraging on this large dataset, we explore a few sketch-specific traits that were otherwise under-studied in prior literature. Instead of following the conventional sketch recognition task, we introduce the novel problem of sketch hashing retrieval which is not only more challenging, but also offers a better testbed for large-scale sketch analysis, since: (i) more fine-grained sketch feature learning is required to accommodate the large variations in style and abstraction, and (ii) a compact binary code needs to be learned at the same time to enable efficient retrieval. Key to our network design is the embedding of unique characteristics of human sketch, where (i) a two-branch CNN-RNN architecture is adapted to explore the temporal ordering of strokes, and (ii) a novel hashing loss is specifically designed to accommodate both the temporal and abstract traits of sketches. By working with a 3.8M sketch dataset, we show that state-of-the-art hashing models specifically engineered for static images fail to perform well on temporal sketch data. Our network on the other hand not only offers the best retrieval performance on various code sizes, but also yields the best generalization performance under a zero-shot setting and when re-purposed for sketch recognition. Such superior performances effectively demonstrate the benefit of our sketch-specific design. 
### 111.Patch-based Face Recognition using a Hierarchical Multi-label Matcher [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01417.pdf)
> This paper proposes a hierarchical multi-label matcher for patch-based face recognition. In signature generation, a face image is iteratively divided into multi-level patches. Two different types of patch divisions and signatures are introduced for 2D facial image and texture-lifted image, respectively. The matcher training consists of three steps. First, local classifiers are built to learn the local matching of each patch. Second, the hierarchical relationships defined between local patches are used to learn the global matching of each patch. Three ways are introduced to learn the global matching: majority voting, l1-regularized weighting, and decision rule. Last, the global matchings of different levels are combined as the final matching. Experimental results on different face recognition tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed matcher at the cost of gallery generalization. Compared with the UR2D system, the proposed matcher improves the Rank-1 accuracy significantly by 3% and 0.18% on the UHDB31 dataset and IJB-A dataset, respectively. 
### 112.Unsupervised Semantic-based Aggregation of Deep Convolutional Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01422.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a simple but effective semantic-based aggregation (SBA) method. The proposed SBA utilizes the discriminative filters of deep convolutional layers as semantic detectors. Moreover, we propose the effective unsupervised strategy to select some semantic detectors to generate the "probabilistic proposals", which highlight certain discriminative pattern of objects and suppress the noise of background. The final global SBA representation could then be acquired by aggregating the regional representations weighted by the selected "probabilistic proposals" corresponding to various semantic content. Our unsupervised SBA is easy to generalize and achieves excellent performance on various tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that our unsupervised SBA outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised aggregation methods on image retrieval, place recognition and cloud classification. 
### 113.Representing Videos based on Scene Layouts for Recognizing  Agent-in-Place Actions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01429.pdf)
> We address the recognition of agent-in-place actions, which are associated with agents who perform them and places where they occur, in the context of outdoor home surveillance. We introduce a representation of the geometry and topology of scene layouts so that a network can generalize from the layouts observed in the training set to unseen layouts in the test set. This Layout-Induced Video Representation (LIVR) abstracts away low-level appearance variance and encodes geometric and topological relationships of places in a specific scene layout. LIVR partitions the semantic features of a video clip into different places to force the network to learn place-based feature descriptions; to predict the confidence of each action, LIVR aggregates features from the place associated with an action and its adjacent places on the scene layout. We introduce the Agent-in-Place Action dataset to show that our method allows neural network models to generalize significantly better to unseen scenes. 
### 114.Learning Discriminative Features with Multiple Granularities for Person  Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01438.pdf)
> The combination of global and partial features has been an essential solution to improve discriminative performances in person re-identification (Re-ID) tasks. Previous part-based methods mainly focus on locating regions with specific pre-defined semantics to learn local representations, which increases learning difficulty but not efficient or robust to scenarios with large variances. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end feature learning strategy integrating discriminative information with various granularities. We carefully design the Multiple Granularity Network (MGN), a multi-branch deep network architecture consisting of one branch for global feature representations and two branches for local feature representations. Instead of learning on semantic regions, we uniformly partition the images into several stripes, and vary the number of parts in different local branches to obtain local feature representations with multiple granularities. Comprehensive experiments implemented on the mainstream evaluation datasets including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reid and CUHK03 indicate that our method has robustly achieved state-of-the-art performances and outperformed any existing approaches by a large margin. For example, on Market-1501 dataset in single query mode, we achieve a state-of-the-art result of Rank-1/mAP=96.6%/94.2% after re-ranking. 
### 115.Jointly Discovering Visual Objects and Spoken Words from Raw Sensory  Input [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01452.pdf)
> In this paper, we explore neural network models that learn to associate segments of spoken audio captions with the semantically relevant portions of natural images that they refer to. We demonstrate that these audio-visual associative localizations emerge from network-internal representations learned as a by-product of training to perform an image-audio retrieval task. Our models operate directly on the image pixels and speech waveform, and do not rely on any conventional supervision in the form of labels, segmentations, or alignments between the modalities during training. We perform analysis using the Places 205 and ADE20k datasets demonstrating that our models implicitly learn semantically-coupled object and word detectors. 
### 116.Density Adaptive Point Set Registration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01495.pdf)
> Probabilistic methods for point set registration have demonstrated competitive results in recent years. These techniques estimate a probability distribution model of the point clouds. While such a representation has shown promise, it is highly sensitive to variations in the density of 3D points. This fundamental problem is primarily caused by changes in the sensor location across point sets. We revisit the foundations of the probabilistic registration paradigm. Contrary to previous works, we model the underlying structure of the scene as a latent probability distribution, and thereby induce invariance to point set density changes. Both the probabilistic model of the scene and the registration parameters are inferred by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence in an Expectation Maximization based framework. Our density-adaptive registration successfully handles severe density variations commonly encountered in terrestrial Lidar applications. We perform extensive experiments on several challenging real-world Lidar datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic methods for multi-view registration, without the need of re-sampling. 
### 117.Stochastic Adversarial Video Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01523.pdf)
> Being able to predict what may happen in the future requires an in-depth understanding of the physical and causal rules that govern the world. A model that is able to do so has a number of appealing applications, from robotic planning to representation learning. However, learning to predict raw future observations, such as frames in a video, is exceedingly challenging -- the ambiguous nature of the problem can cause a naively designed model to average together possible futures into a single, blurry prediction. Recently, this has been addressed by two distinct approaches: (a) latent variational variable models that explicitly model underlying stochasticity and (b) adversarially-trained models that aim to produce naturalistic images. However, a standard latent variable model can struggle to produce realistic results, and a standard adversarially-trained model underutilizes latent variables and fails to produce diverse predictions. We show that these distinct methods are in fact complementary. Combining the two produces predictions that look more realistic to human raters and better cover the range of possible futures. Our method outperforms prior and concurrent work in these aspects. 
### 118.Boosting Handwriting Text Recognition in Small Databases with Transfer  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01527.pdf)
> In this paper we deal with the offline handwriting text recognition (HTR) problem with reduced training datasets. Recent HTR solutions based on artificial neural networks exhibit remarkable solutions in referenced databases. These deep learning neural networks are composed of both convolutional (CNN) and long short-term memory recurrent units (LSTM). In addition, connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is the key to avoid segmentation at character level, greatly facilitating the labeling task. One of the main drawbacks of the CNNLSTM-CTC (CLC) solutions is that they need a considerable part of the text to be transcribed for every type of calligraphy, typically in the order of a few thousands of lines. Furthermore, in some scenarios the text to transcribe is not that long, e.g. in the Washington database. The CLC typically overfits for this reduced number of training samples. Our proposal is based on the transfer learning (TL) from the parameters learned with a bigger database. We first investigate, for a reduced and fixed number of training samples, 350 lines, how the learning from a large database, the IAM, can be transferred to the learning of the CLC of a reduced database, Washington. We focus on which layers of the network could be not re-trained. We conclude that the best solution is to re-train the whole CLC parameters initialized to the values obtained after the training of the CLC from the larger database. We also investigate results when the training size is further reduced. The differences in the CER are more remarkable when training with just 350 lines, a CER of 3.3% is achieved with TL while we have a CER of 18.2% when training from scratch. As a byproduct, the learning times are quite reduced. Similar good results are obtained from the Parzival database when trained with this reduced number of lines and this new approach. 
### 119.Self-supervised Learning of Geometrically Stable Features Through  Probabilistic Introspection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01552.pdf)
> Self-supervision can dramatically cut back the amount of manually-labelled data required to train deep neural networks. While self-supervision has usually been considered for tasks such as image classification, in this paper we aim at extending it to geometry-oriented tasks such as semantic matching and part detection. We do so by building on several recent ideas in unsupervised landmark detection. Our approach learns dense distinctive visual descriptors from an unlabelled dataset of images using synthetic image transformations. It does so by means of a robust probabilistic formulation that can introspectively determine which image regions are likely to result in stable image matching. We show empirically that a network pre-trained in this manner requires significantly less supervision to learn semantic object parts compared to numerous pre-training alternatives. We also show that the pre-trained representation is excellent for semantic object matching. 
### 120.Semi-Supervised Deep Metrics for Image Registration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01565.pdf)
> Deep metrics have been shown effective as similarity measures in multi-modal image registration; however, the metrics are currently constructed from aligned image pairs in the training data. In this paper, we propose a strategy for learning such metrics from roughly aligned training data. Symmetrizing the data corrects bias in the metric that results from misalignment in the data (at the expense of increased variance), while random perturbations to the data, i.e. dithering, ensures that the metric has a single mode, and is amenable to registration by optimization. Evaluation is performed on the task of registration on separate unseen test image pairs. The results demonstrate the feasibility of learning a useful deep metric from substantially misaligned training data, in some cases the results are significantly better than from Mutual Information. Data augmentation via dithering is, therefore, an effective strategy for discharging the need for well-aligned training data; this brings deep metric registration from the realm of supervised to semi-supervised machine learning. 
### 121.StainGAN: Stain Style Transfer for Digital Histological Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01601.pdf)
> Digitized Histological diagnosis is in increasing demand. However, color variations due to various factors are imposing obstacles to the diagnosis process. The problem of stain color variations is a well-defined problem with many proposed solutions. Most of these solutions are highly dependent on a reference template slide. We propose a deep-learning solution inspired by CycleGANs that is trained end-to-end, eliminating the need for an expert to pick a representative reference slide. Our approach showed superior results quantitatively and qualitatively against the state of the art methods (10% improvement visually using SSIM). We further validated our method on a clinical use-case, namely Breast Cancer tumor classification, showing 12% increase in AUC. The code will be made publicly available. 
### 122.Learnable Exposure Fusion for Dynamic Scenes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01611.pdf)
> In this paper, we focus on Exposure Fusion (EF) [ExposFusi2] for dynamic scenes. The task is to fuse multiple images obtained by exposure bracketing to create an image which comprises a high level of details. Typically, such images are not possible to obtain directly from a camera due to hardware limitations, e.g., a limited dynamic range of the sensor. A major problem of such tasks is that the images may not be spatially aligned due to scene motion or camera motion. It is known that the required alignment by image registration problems is ill-posed. In this case, the images to be aligned vary in their intensity range, which makes the problem even more difficult. <br />To address the mentioned problems, we propose an end-to-end \emph{Convolutional Neural Network} (CNN) based approach to learn to estimate exposure fusion from $2$ and $3$ Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images depicting different scene contents. To the best of our knowledge, no efficient and robust CNN-based end-to-end approach can be found in the literature for this kind of problem. The idea is to create a dataset with perfectly aligned LDR images to obtain ground-truth exposure fusion images. At the same time, we obtain additional LDR images with some motion, having the same exposure fusion ground-truth as the perfectly aligned LDR images. This way, we can train an end-to-end CNN having misaligned LDR input images, but with a proper ground truth exposure fusion image. We propose a specific CNN-architecture to solve this problem. In various experiments, we show that the proposed approach yields excellent results. 
### 123.Image Generation from Scene Graphs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01622.pdf)
> To truly understand the visual world our models should be able not only to recognize images but also generate them. To this end, there has been exciting recent progress on generating images from natural language descriptions. These methods give stunning results on limited domains such as descriptions of birds or flowers, but struggle to faithfully reproduce complex sentences with many objects and relationships. To overcome this limitation we propose a method for generating images from scene graphs, enabling explicitly reasoning about objects and their relationships. Our model uses graph convolution to process input graphs, computes a scene layout by predicting bounding boxes and segmentation masks for objects, and converts the layout to an image with a cascaded refinement network. The network is trained adversarially against a pair of discriminators to ensure realistic outputs. We validate our approach on Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff, where qualitative results, ablations, and user studies demonstrate our method's ability to generate complex images with multiple objects. 
### 124.Evaluation of Object Trackers in Distorted Surveillance Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01624.pdf)
> Object tracking in realistic scenarios is a difficult problem affected by various image factors such as occlusion, clutter, confusion, object shape, unstable speed, and zooming. While these conditions do affect tracking performance, there is no clear distinction between the scene dependent challenges like occlusion, clutter, etc., and the challenges imposed by traditional notions of impairments from capture, compression, processing, and transmission. This paper is concerned with the latter interpretation of quality as it affects video tracking performance. In this work we aim to evaluate two state-of-the-art trackers (STRUCK and TLD) systematically and experimentally in surveillance videos affected by in-capture distortions such as under-exposure and defocus. We evaluate these trackers with the area under curve (AUC) values of success plots and precision curves. In spite of the fact that STRUCK and TLD have ranked high in video tracking surveys. This study concludes that incapture distortions severely affect the performance of these trackers. For this reason, the design and construction of a robust tracker with respect to these distortions remains an open question that can be answered by creating algorithms that makes use of perceptual features to compensate the degradations provided by these distortions. 
### 125.Unifying Bilateral Filtering and Adversarial Training for Robust Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01635.pdf)
> Recent analysis of deep neural networks has revealed their vulnerability to carefully structured adversarial examples. Many effective algorithms exist to craft these adversarial examples, but performant defenses seem to be far away. In this work, we explore the use of edge-aware bilateral filtering as a projection back to the space of natural images. We show that bilateral filtering is an effective defense in multiple attack settings, where the strength of the adversary gradually increases. In the case of adversary who has no knowledge of the defense, bilateral filtering can remove more than 90% of adversarial examples from a variety of different attacks. To harden our network against an adversary with complete knowledge of our defense, we adapt the bilateral filter as a trainable layer in a neural network. When trained under a framework of robust optimization, we show that the resulting model is hard to fool with even the best attack methods. 
### 126.A Pyramid CNN for Dense-Leaves Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01646.pdf)
> Automatic detection and segmentation of overlapping leaves in dense foliage can be a difficult task, particularly for leaves with strong textures and high occlusions. We present Dense-Leaves, an image dataset with ground truth segmentation labels that can be used to train and quantify algorithms for leaf segmentation in the wild. We also propose a pyramid convolutional neural network with multi-scale predictions that detects and discriminates leaf boundaries from interior textures. Using these detected boundaries, closed-contour boundaries around individual leaves are estimated with a watershed-based algorithm. The result is an instance segmenter for dense leaves. Promising segmentation results for leaves in dense foliage are obtained. 
### 127.Pixel2Mesh: Generating 3D Mesh Models from Single RGB Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01654.pdf)
> We propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture that produces a 3D shape in triangular mesh from a single color image. Limited by the nature of deep neural network, previous methods usually represent a 3D shape in volume or point cloud, and it is non-trivial to convert them to the more ready-to-use mesh model. Unlike the existing methods, our network represents 3D mesh in a graph-based convolutional neural network and produces correct geometry by progressively deforming an ellipsoid, leveraging perceptual features extracted from the input image. We adopt a coarse-to-fine strategy to make the whole deformation procedure stable, and define various of mesh related losses to capture properties of different levels to guarantee visually appealing and physically accurate 3D geometry. Extensive experiments show that our method not only qualitatively produces mesh model with better details, but also achieves higher 3D shape estimation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. 
### 128.Learning Strict Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01661.pdf)
> A family of super deep networks, referred to as residual networks or ResNet, achieved record-beating performance in various visual tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The ability to train very deep networks naturally pushed the researchers to use enormous resources to achieve the best performance. Consequently, in many applications super deep residual networks were employed for just a marginal improvement in performance. In this paper, we propose epsilon-ResNet that allows us to automatically discard redundant layers, which produces responses that are smaller than a threshold epsilon, with a marginal or no loss in performance. The epsilon-ResNet architecture can be achieved using a few additional rectified linear units in the original ResNet. Our method does not use any additional variables nor numerous trials like other hyper-parameter optimization techniques. The layer selection is achieved using a single training process and the evaluation is performed on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets. In some instances, we achieve about 80% reduction in the number of parameters. 
### 129.Learning to Separate Object Sounds by Watching Unlabeled Video [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01665.pdf)
> Perceiving a scene most fully requires all the senses. Yet modeling how objects look and sound is challenging: most natural scenes and events contain multiple objects, and the audio track mixes all the sound sources together. We propose to learn audio-visual object models from unlabeled video, then exploit the visual context to perform audio source separation in novel videos. Our approach relies on a deep multi-instance multi-label learning framework to disentangle the audio frequency bases that map to individual visual objects, even without observing/hearing those objects in isolation. We show how the recovered disentangled bases can be used to guide audio source separation to obtain better-separated, object-level sounds. Our work is the first to learn audio source separation from large-scale "in the wild" videos containing multiple audio sources per video. We obtain state-of-the-art results on visually-aided audio source separation and audio denoising.

### 130.Cancelable Indexing Based on Low-rank Approximation of  Correlation-invariant Random Filtering for Fast and Secure Biometric  Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01670.pdf)
> A cancelable biometric scheme called correlation-invariant random filtering (CIRF) is known as a promising template protection scheme. This scheme transforms a biometric feature represented as an image via the 2D number theoretic transform (NTT) and random filtering. CIRF has perfect secrecy in that the transformed feature leaks no information about the original feature. However, CIRF cannot be applied to large-scale biometric identification, since the 2D inverse NTT in the matching phase requires high computational time. Furthermore, existing biometric indexing schemes cannot be used in conjunction with template protection schemes to speed up biometric identification, since a biometric index leaks some information about the original feature. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing scheme called "cancelable indexing" to speed up CIRF without losing its security properties. The proposed scheme is based on fast computation of CIRF via low-rank approximation of biometric images and via a minimum spanning tree representation of low-rank matrices in the Fourier domain. We prove that the transformed index leaks no information about the original index and the original biometric feature (i.e., perfect secrecy), and thoroughly discuss the security of the proposed scheme. We also demonstrate that it significantly reduces the one-to-many matching time using a finger-vein dataset that includes six fingers from 505 subjects. 
### 131.Hallucinated-IQA: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment via Adversarial  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01681.pdf)
> No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) is a fundamental yet challenging task in low-level computer vision community. The difficulty is particularly pronounced for the limited information, for which the corresponding reference for comparison is typically absent. Although various feature extraction mechanisms have been leveraged from natural scene statistics to deep neural networks in previous methods, the performance bottleneck still exists. In this work, we propose a hallucination-guided quality regression network to address the issue. We firstly generate a hallucinated reference constrained on the distorted image, to compensate the absence of the true reference. Then, we pair the information of hallucinated reference with the distorted image, and forward them to the regressor to learn the perceptual discrepancy with the guidance of an implicit ranking relationship within the generator, and therefore produce the precise quality prediction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, comprehensive experiments are evaluated on four popular image quality assessment benchmarks. Our method significantly outperforms all the previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins. The code and model will be publicly available on the project page <a href="https://kwanyeelin.github.io/projects/HIQA/HIQA.html.">this https URL</a> 
### 132.Markerless Inside-Out Tracking for Interventional Applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01708.pdf)
> Tracking of rotation and translation of medical instruments plays a substantial role in many modern interventions. Traditional external optical tracking systems are often subject to line-of-sight issues, in particular when the region of interest is difficult to access or the procedure allows only for limited rigid body markers. The introduction of inside-out tracking systems aims to overcome these issues. We propose a marker-less tracking system based on visual SLAM to enable tracking of instruments in an interventional scenario. To achieve this goal, we mount a miniature multi-modal (monocular, stereo, active depth) vision system on the object of interest and relocalize its pose within an adaptive map of the operating room. We compare state-of-the-art algorithmic pipelines and apply the idea to transrectal 3D Ultrasound (TRUS) compounding of the prostate. Obtained volumes are compared to reconstruction using a commercial optical tracking system as well as a robotic manipulator. Feature-based binocular SLAM is identified as the most promising method and is tested extensively in challenging clinical environment under severe occlusion and for the use case of prostate US biopsies. 
### 133.Finding beans in burgers: Deep semantic-visual embedding with  localization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01720.pdf)
> Several works have proposed to learn a two-path neural network that maps images and texts, respectively, to a same shared Euclidean space where geometry captures useful semantic relationships. Such a multi-modal embedding can be trained and used for various tasks, notably image captioning. In the present work, we introduce a new architecture of this type, with a visual path that leverages recent space-aware pooling mechanisms. Combined with a textual path which is jointly trained from scratch, our semantic-visual embedding offers a versatile model. Once trained under the supervision of captioned images, it yields new state-of-the-art performance on cross-modal retrieval. It also allows the localization of new concepts from the embedding space into any input image, delivering state-of-the-art result on the visual grounding of phrases. 
### 134.Identifying Cross-Depicted Historical Motifs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01728.pdf)
> Cross-depiction is the problem of identifying the same object even when it is depicted in a variety of manners. This is a common problem in handwritten historical documents image analysis, for instance when the same letter or motif is depicted in several different ways. It is a simple task for humans yet conventional heuristic computer vision methods struggle to cope with it. In this paper we address this problem using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques on a dataset of historical watermarks containing images created with different methods of reproduction, such as hand tracing, rubbing, and radiography. To study the robustness of deep learning based approaches to the cross-depiction problem, we measure their performance on two different tasks: classification and similarity rankings. For the former we achieve a classification accuracy of 96% using deep convolutional neural networks. For the latter we have a false positive rate at 95% true positive rate of 0.11. These results outperform state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. 
### 135.Missing Slice Recovery for Tensors Using a Low-rank Model in Embedded  Space [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01736.pdf)
> Let us consider a case where all of the elements in some continuous slices are missing in tensor data. <br />In this case, the nuclear-norm and total variation regularization methods usually fail to recover the missing elements. <br />The key problem is capturing some delay/shift-invariant structure. <br />In this study, we consider a low-rank model in an embedded space of a tensor. <br />For this purpose, we extend a delay embedding for a time series to a "multi-way delay-embedding transform" for a tensor, which takes a given incomplete tensor as the input and outputs a higher-order incomplete Hankel tensor. <br />The higher-order tensor is then recovered by Tucker-based low-rank tensor factorization. <br />Finally, an estimated tensor can be obtained by using the inverse multi-way delay embedding transform of the recovered higher-order tensor. <br />Our experiments showed that the proposed method successfully recovered missing slices for some color images and functional magnetic resonance images. 
### 136.Bringing Cartoons to Life: Towards Improved Cartoon Face Detection and  Recognition Systems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01753.pdf)
> Given the recent deep learning advancements in face detection and recognition techniques for human faces, this paper answers the question "how well would they work for cartoons'?" - a domain that remains largely unexplored until recently, mainly due to the unavailability of large scale datasets and the failure of traditional methods on these. Our work studies and extends multiple frameworks for the aforementioned tasks. For face detection, we incorporate the Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN) architecture and contrast it with conventional methods. For face recognition, our two-fold contributions include: (i) an inductive transfer learning approach combining the feature learning capability of the Inception v3 network and the feature recognizing capability of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), (ii) a proposed Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN) framework trained over a fusion of pixel values and 15 manually located facial keypoints. All the methods are evaluated on the Cartoon Faces in the Wild (IIIT-CFW) database. We demonstrate that the HCNN model offers stability superior to that of Inception+SVM over larger input variations, and explore the plausible architectural principles. We show that the Inception+SVM model establishes a state-of-the-art F1 score on the task of gender recognition of cartoon faces. Further, we introduce a small database hosting location coordinates of 15 points on the cartoon faces belonging to 50 public figures of the IIIT-CFW database. 
### 137.Learning a Robust Society of Tracking Parts using Co-occurrence  Constraints [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01771.pdf)
> Object tracking is an essential problem in computer vision that has been researched for several decades. One of the main challenges in tracking is to adapt to object appearance changes over time, in order to avoid drifting to background clutter. We address this challenge by proposing a deep neural network architecture composed of different parts, which functions as a society of tracking parts. The parts work in conjunction according to a certain policy and learn from each other in a robust manner, using co-occurrence constraints that ensure robust inference and learning. From a structural point of view, our network is composed of two main pathways. One pathway is more conservative. It carefully monitors a large set of simple tracker parts learned as linear filters over deep feature activation maps. It assigns the parts different roles. It promotes the reliable ones and removes the inconsistent ones. We learn these filters simultaneously in an efficient way, with a single closed-form formulation for which we propose novel theoretical properties. The second pathway is more progressive. It is learned completely online and thus it is able to better model object appearance changes. In order to adapt in a robust manner, it is learned only on highly confident frames, which are decided using co-occurrences with the first pathway. Thus, our system has the full benefit of two main approaches in tracking. The larger set of simpler filter parts offers robustness, while the full deep network learned online provides adaptability to change. As shown in the experimental section, our approach achieves state of the art performance on the challenging VOT17 benchmark, outperforming the existing published methods both on the general EAO metric as well as in the number of fails by a significant margin. 
### 138.End-to-End Saliency Mapping via Probability Distribution Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01793.pdf)
> Most saliency estimation methods aim to explicitly model low-level conspicuity cues such as edges or blobs and may additionally incorporate top-down cues using face or text detection. Data-driven methods for training saliency models using eye-fixation data are increasingly popular, particularly with the introduction of large-scale datasets and deep architectures. However, current methods in this latter paradigm use loss functions designed for classification or regression tasks whereas saliency estimation is evaluated on topographical maps. In this work, we introduce a new saliency map model which formulates a map as a generalized Bernoulli distribution. We then train a deep architecture to predict such maps using novel loss functions which pair the softmax activation function with measures designed to compute distances between probability distributions. We show in extensive experiments the effectiveness of such loss functions over standard ones on four public benchmark datasets, and demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art saliency methods. 
### 139.Guess Where? Actor-Supervision for Spatiotemporal Action Localization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01824.pdf)
> This paper addresses the problem of spatiotemporal localization of actions in videos. Compared to leading approaches, which all learn to localize based on carefully annotated boxes on training video frames, we adhere to a weakly-supervised solution that only requires a video class label. We introduce an actor-supervised architecture that exploits the inherent compositionality of actions in terms of actor transformations, to localize actions. We make two contributions. First, we propose actor proposals derived from a detector for human and non-human actors intended for images, which is linked over time by Siamese similarity matching to account for actor deformations. Second, we propose an actor-based attention mechanism that enables the localization of the actions from action class labels and actor proposals and is end-to-end trainable. Experiments on three human and non-human action datasets show actor supervision is state-of-the-art for weakly-supervised action localization and is even competitive to some fully-supervised alternatives. 
### 140.Towards radiologist-level cancer risk assessment in CT lung screening  using deep learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01901.pdf)
> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the US, responsible for more deaths than breast, prostate, colon and pancreas cancer combined. Recently, it has been demonstrated that screening those at high-risk for lung cancer low-dose computed tomography (CT) of the chest can significantly reduce this death rate. The process of evaluating a chest CT scan involves the identification of nodules that are contained within a scan as well as the evaluation of the likelihood that a nodule is malignant based on its imaging characteristics. This has motivated researchers to develop image analysis research tools, such as nodule detectors and nodule classifiers that can assist radiologists to make accurate assessments of the patient cancer risk. <br />In this work, we propose a two-stage framework that can assess the lung cancer risk associated with a low-dose chest CT scan. At the first stage, our framework employs a nodule detector; while in the second stage, we use both the image area around the nodules and nodule features as inputs to a neural network that estimates the malignancy risk of the whole CT scan. The proposed approach: (a) has better performance than the PanCan Risk Model, a widely accepted method for cancer malignancy assessment, achieving around 7% better Area Under Curve score in two independent datasets we have employed; (b) has comparable performance to radiologists in estimating cancer risk at patient level; (c) employs a novel multi-instance weakly-labeled approach to train the deep learning network that requires confirmed cancer diagnosis only at the patient level (not at the nodule level); and (d) employs a large number of lung CT scans (more than 8000) from heterogeneous data sources (NLST, LHMC, and Kaggle competition data) to validate and compare model performance. AUC scores for our model, evaluated against confirmed cancer diagnosis, range between 82% to 90%. 
### 141.Multi-level Activation for Segmentation of Hierarchically-nested Classes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01910.pdf)
> For many biological image segmentation tasks, including topological knowledge, such as the nesting of classes, can greatly improve results. However, most `out-of-the-box' CNN models are still blind to such prior information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to encode this information, through a multi-level activation layer and three compatible losses. We benchmark all of them on nuclei segmentation in bright-field microscopy cell images from the 2018 Data Science Bowl challenge, offering an exemplary segmentation task with cells and nested subcellular structures. Our scheme greatly speeds up learning, and outperforms standard multi-class classification with soft-max activation and a previously proposed method stemming from it, improving the Dice score significantly (p-values&lt;0.007). Our approach is conceptually simple, easy to implement and can be integrated in any CNN architecture. It can be generalized to a higher number of classes, with or without further relations of containment. 
### 142.Iris Recognition After Death [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01962.pdf)
> This paper presents a comprehensive study of post-mortem human iris recognition carried out for 1,200 near-infrared and 1,787 visible-light samples collected from 37 deceased individuals kept in the mortuary conditions. We used four independent iris recognition methods (three commercial and one academic) to analyze genuine and impostor comparison scores and check the dynamics of iris quality decay over a period of up to 814 hours after death. This study shows that post-mortem iris recognition may be close-to-perfect approximately 5 to 7 hours after death and occasionally is still viable even 21 days after death. These conclusions contradict the statements present in past literature that the iris is unusable as a biometrics shortly after death, and show that the dynamics of post-mortem changes to the iris that are important for biometric identification are more moderate than previously hypothesized. The paper contains a thorough medical commentary that helps to understand which post-mortem metamorphoses of the eye may impact the performance of automatic iris recognition. We also show that post-mortem iris recognition works equally well for images taken in near-infrared and when the red channel of visible-light sample is used. However, cross-wavelength matching presents significantly worse performance. This paper conforms to reproducible research and the database used in this study is made publicly available to facilitate research of post-mortem iris recognition. To our knowledge, this paper offers the most comprehensive evaluation of post-mortem iris recognition and the largest database of post-mortem iris images. 
### 143.CBMV: A Coalesced Bidirectional Matching Volume for Disparity Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01967.pdf)
> Recently, there has been a paradigm shift in stereo matching with learning-based methods achieving the best results on all popular benchmarks. The success of these methods is due to the availability of training data with ground truth; training learning-based systems on these datasets has allowed them to surpass the accuracy of conventional approaches based on heuristics and assumptions. Many of these assumptions, however, had been validated extensively and hold for the majority of possible inputs. In this paper, we generate a matching volume leveraging both data with ground truth and conventional wisdom. We accomplish this by coalescing diverse evidence from a bidirectional matching process via random forest classifiers. We show that the resulting matching volume estimation method achieves similar accuracy to purely data-driven alternatives on benchmarks and that it generalizes to unseen data much better. In fact, the results we submitted to the KITTI and ETH3D benchmarks were generated using a classifier trained on the Middlebury 2014 dataset. 
### 144.Look into Person: Joint Body Parsing &amp; Pose Estimation Network and A New  Benchmark [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01984.pdf)
> Human parsing and pose estimation have recently received considerable interest due to their substantial application potentials. However, the existing datasets have limited numbers of images and annotations and lack a variety of human appearances and coverage of challenging cases in unconstrained environments. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark named "Look into Person (LIP)" that provides a significant advancement in terms of scalability, diversity, and difficulty, which are crucial for future developments in human-centric analysis. This comprehensive dataset contains over 50,000 elaborately annotated images with 19 semantic part labels and 16 body joints, which are captured from a broad range of viewpoints, occlusions, and background complexities. Using these rich annotations, we perform detailed analyses of the leading human parsing and pose estimation approaches, thereby obtaining insights into the successes and failures of these methods. To further explore and take advantage of the semantic correlation of these two tasks, we propose a novel joint human parsing and pose estimation network to explore efficient context modeling, which can simultaneously predict parsing and pose with extremely high quality. Furthermore, we simplify the network to solve human parsing by exploring a novel self-supervised structure-sensitive learning approach, which imposes human pose structures into the parsing results without resorting to extra supervision. The dataset, code and models are available at <a href="http://www.sysu-hcp.net/lip/.">this http URL</a> 
### 145.Regularizing Deep Networks by Modeling and Predicting Label Structure [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02009.pdf)
> We construct custom regularization functions for use in supervised training of deep neural networks. Our technique is applicable when the ground-truth labels themselves exhibit internal structure; we derive a regularizer by learning an autoencoder over the set of annotations. Training thereby becomes a two-phase procedure. The first phase models labels with an autoencoder. The second phase trains the actual network of interest by attaching an auxiliary branch that must predict output via a hidden layer of the autoencoder. After training, we discard this auxiliary branch. <br />We experiment in the context of semantic segmentation, demonstrating this regularization strategy leads to consistent accuracy boosts over baselines, both when training from scratch, or in combination with ImageNet pretraining. Gains are also consistent over different choices of convolutional network architecture. As our regularizer is discarded after training, our method has zero cost at test time; the performance improvements are essentially free. We are simply able to learn better network weights by building an abstract model of the label space, and then training the network to understand this abstraction alongside the original task. 
### 146.A Multi-Layer Approach to Superpixel-based Higher-order Conditional  Random Field for Semantic Image Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02032.pdf)
> Superpixel-based Higher-order Conditional random fields (SP-HO-CRFs) are known for their effectiveness in enforcing both short and long spatial contiguity for pixelwise labelling in computer vision. However, their higher-order potentials are usually too complex to learn and often incur a high computational cost in performing inference. We propose an new approximation approach to SP-HO-CRFs that resolves these problems. Our approach is a multi-layer CRF framework that inherits the simplicity from pairwise CRFs by formulating both the higher-order and pairwise cues into the same pairwise potentials in the first layer. Essentially, this approach provides accuracy enhancement on the basis of pairwise CRFs without training by reusing their pre-trained parameters and/or weights. The proposed multi-layer approach performs especially well in delineating the boundary details (boarders) of object categories such as "trees" and "bushes". Multiple sets of experiments conducted on dataset MSRC-21 and PASCAL VOC 2012 validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods. 
### 147.Pedestrian-Synthesis-GAN: Generating Pedestrian Data in Real Scene and  Beyond [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02047.pdf)
> State-of-the-art pedestrian detection models have achieved great success in many benchmarks. However, these models require lots of annotation information and the labeling process usually takes much time and efforts. In this paper, we propose a method to generate labeled pedestrian data and adapt them to support the training of pedestrian detectors. The proposed framework is built on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with multiple discriminators, trying to synthesize realistic pedestrians and learn the background context simultaneously. To handle the pedestrians of different sizes, we adopt the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer in the discriminator. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks. The results show that our framework can smoothly synthesize pedestrians on background images of variations and different levels of details. To quantitatively evaluate our approach, we add the generated samples into training data of the baseline pedestrian detectors and show the synthetic images are able to improve the detectors' performance. 
### 148.Average Biased ReLU Based CNN Descriptor for Improved Face Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02051.pdf)
> The convolutional neural networks (CNN) like AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGGNet, etc. have been proven as the very discriminative feature descriptor for many computer vision problems. The trained CNN model over one dataset performs reasonably well over another dataset of similar type and outperforms the hand-designed feature descriptor. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer discards some information in order to introduce the non-linearity. In this paper, it is proposed that the discriminative ability of deep image representation using trained model can be improved by Average Biased ReLU (AB-ReLU) at last few layers. Basically, AB-ReLU improves the discriminative ability by two ways: 1) it also exploits some of the discriminative and discarded negative information of ReLU and 2) it kills the irrelevant and positive information used by ReLU. The VGGFace model already trained in MatConvNet over the VGG-Face dataset is used as the feature descriptor for face retrieval over other face datasets. The proposed approach is tested over six challenging unconstrained and robust face datasets like PubFig, LFW, PaSC, AR, etc. in retrieval framework. It is observed that AB-ReLU is consistently performed better than ReLU using VGGFace pretrained model over face datasets. 
### 149.FPAN: Fine-grained and Progressive Attention Localization Network for  Data Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02056.pdf)
> The Localization of the target object for data retrieval is a key issue in the Intelligent and Connected Transportation Systems (ICTS). However, due to lack of intelligence in the traditional transportation system, it can take tremendous resources to manually retrieve and locate the queried objects among a large number of images. In order to solve this issue, we propose an effective method to query-based object localization that uses artificial intelligence techniques to automatically locate the queried object in the complex background. The presented method is termed as Fine-grained and Progressive Attention Localization Network (FPAN), which uses an image and a queried object as input to accurately locate the target object in the image. Specifically, the fine-grained attention module is naturally embedded into each layer of the convolution neural network (CNN), thereby gradually suppressing the regions that are irrelevant to the queried object and eventually shrinking attention to the target area. We further employ top-down attentions fusion algorithm operated by a learnable cascade up-sampling structure to establish the connection between the attention map and the exact location of the queried object in the original image. Furthermore, the FPAN is trained by multi-task learning with box segmentation loss and cosine loss. At last, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both queried-based digit localization and object tracking with synthetic and benchmark datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that our algorithm is far superior to other algorithms in the synthesis datasets and outperforms most existing trackers on the OTB and VOT datasets.

> The generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is used to derive a detector for solid sub-pixel targets in hyperspectral imagery. A closed-form solution is obtained that optimizes the replacement target model when the background is a fat-tailed elliptically-contoured multivariate t-distribution. This generalizes GLRT-based detectors that have previously been derived for the replacement target model with Gaussian background, and for the additive target model with an elliptically-contoured background. Experiments with simulated hyperspectral data illustrate the performance of this detector in various parameter regimes. 
### 151.Noise-resistant Deep Learning for Object Classification in 3D Point  Clouds Using a Point Pair Descriptor [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02077.pdf)
> Object retrieval and classification in point cloud data is challenged by noise, irregular sampling density and occlusion. To address this issue, we propose a point pair descriptor that is robust to noise and occlusion and achieves high retrieval accuracy. We further show how the proposed descriptor can be used in a 4D convolutional neural network for the task of object classification. We propose a novel 4D convolutional layer that is able to learn class-specific clusters in the descriptor histograms. Finally, we provide experimental validation on 3 benchmark datasets, which confirms the superiority of the proposed approach. 
### 152.Performance Evaluation of 3D Correspondence Grouping Algorithms [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02085.pdf)
> This paper presents a thorough evaluation of several widely-used 3D correspondence grouping algorithms, motived by their significance in vision tasks relying on correct feature correspondences. A good correspondence grouping algorithm is desired to retrieve as many as inliers from initial feature matches, giving a rise in both precision and recall. Towards this rule, we deploy the experiments on three benchmarks respectively addressing shape retrieval, 3D object recognition and point cloud registration scenarios. The variety in application context brings a rich category of nuisances including noise, varying point densities, clutter, occlusion and partial overlaps. It also results to different ratios of inliers and correspondence distributions for comprehensive evaluation. Based on the quantitative outcomes, we give a summarization of the merits/demerits of the evaluated algorithms from both performance and efficiency perspectives. 
### 153.Question Type Guided Attention in Visual Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02088.pdf)
> Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires integration of feature maps with drastically different structures and focus of the correct regions. Image descriptors have structures at multiple spatial scales, while lexical inputs inherently follow a temporal sequence and naturally cluster into semantically different question types. A lot of previous works use complex models to extract feature representations but neglect to use high-level information summary such as question types in learning. In this work, we propose Question Type-guided Attention (QTA). It utilizes the information of question type to dynamically balance between bottom-up and top-down visual features, respectively extracted from ResNet and Faster R-CNN networks. We experiment with multiple VQA architectures with extensive input ablation studies over the TDIUC dataset and show that QTA systematically improves the performance by more than 5% across multiple question type categories such as "Activity Recognition", "Utility" and "Counting" on TDIUC dataset. By adding QTA on the state-of-art model MCB, we achieve 3% improvement for overall accuracy. Finally, we propose a multi-task extension to predict question types which generalizes QTA to applications that lack of question type, with minimal performance loss. 
### 154.Impact of ultrasound image reconstruction method on breast lesion  classification with neural transfer learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02119.pdf)
> Deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks, have become a methodology of choice in medical image analysis. However, recent studies in computer vision show that even a small modification of input image intensities may cause a deep learning model to classify the image differently. In medical imaging, the distribution of image intensities is related to applied image reconstruction algorithm. In this paper we investigate the impact of ultrasound image reconstruction method on breast lesion classification with neural transfer learning. Due to high dynamic range raw ultrasonic signals are commonly compressed in order to reconstruct B-mode images. Based on raw data acquired from breast lesions, we reconstruct B-mode images using different compression levels. Next, transfer learning is applied for classification. Differently reconstructed images are employed for training and evaluation. We show that the modification of the reconstruction algorithm leads to decrease of classification performance. As a remedy, we propose a method of data augmentation. We show that the augmentation of the training set with differently reconstructed B-mode images leads to a more robust and efficient classification. Our study suggests that it is important to take into account image reconstruction algorithms implemented in medical scanners during development of computer aided diagnosis systems. 
### 155.Motion Segmentation by Exploiting Complementary Geometric Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02142.pdf)
> Many real-world sequences cannot be conveniently categorized as general or degenerate; in such cases, imposing a false dichotomy in using the fundamental matrix or homography model for motion segmentation would lead to difficulty. Even when we are confronted with a general scene-motion, the fundamental matrix approach as a model for motion segmentation still suffers from several defects, which we discuss in this paper. The full potential of the fundamental matrix approach could only be realized if we judiciously harness information from the simpler homography model. From these considerations, we propose a multi-view spectral clustering framework that synergistically combines multiple models together. We show that the performance can be substantially improved in this way. We perform extensive testing on existing motion segmentation datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all of them; we also put forth a more realistic and challenging dataset adapted from the KITTI benchmark, containing real-world effects such as strong perspectives and strong forward translations not seen in the traditional datasets. 
### 156.Adaptive Quantile Sparse Image (AQuaSI) Prior for Inverse Imaging  Problems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02152.pdf)
> Inverse problems play a central role for many classical computer vision and image processing tasks. A key challenge in solving an inverse problem is to find an appropriate prior to convert an ill-posed problem into a well-posed task. Many of the existing priors, like total variation, are based on ad-hoc assumptions that have difficulties to represent the actual distribution of natural images. <br />In this work, we propose the Adaptive Quantile Sparse Image (AQuaSI) prior. It is based on a quantile filter, can be used as a joint filter on guidance data, and be readily plugged into a wide range of numerical optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed prior in joint RGB/depth upsampling, on RGB/NIR image restoration, and in a comparison with related regularization by denoising approaches. 
### 157.Mix and match networks: encoder-decoder alignment for zero-pair image  translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02199.pdf)
> We address the problem of image translation between domains or modalities for which no direct paired data is available (i.e. zero-pair translation). We propose mix and match networks, based on multiple encoders and decoders aligned in such a way that other encoder-decoder pairs can be composed at test time to perform unseen image translation tasks between domains or modalities for which explicit paired samples were not seen during training. We study the impact of autoencoders, side information and losses in improving the alignment and transferability of trained pairwise translation models to unseen translations. We show our approach is scalable and can perform colorization and style transfer between unseen combinations of domains. We evaluate our system in a challenging cross-modal setting where semantic segmentation is estimated from depth images, without explicit access to any depth-semantic segmentation training pairs. Our model outperforms baselines based on pix2pix and CycleGAN models. 
### 158.Ensemble Manifold Segmentation for Model Distillation and  Semi-supervised Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02201.pdf)
> Manifold theory has been the central concept of many learning methods. However, learning modern CNNs with manifold structures has not raised due attention, mainly because of the inconvenience of imposing manifold structures onto the architecture of the CNNs. In this paper we present ManifoldNet, a novel method to encourage learning of manifold-aware representations. Our approach segments the input manifold into a set of fragments. By assigning the corresponding segmentation id as a pseudo label to every sample, we convert the problem of preserving the local manifold structure into a point-wise classification task. Due to its unsupervised nature, the segmentation tends to be noisy. We mitigate this by introducing ensemble manifold segmentation (EMS). EMS accounts for the manifold structure by dividing the training data into an ensemble of classification training sets that contain samples of local proximity. CNNs are trained on these ensembles under a multi-task learning framework to conform to the manifold. ManifoldNet can be trained with only the pseudo labels or together with task-specific labels. We evaluate ManifoldNet on two different tasks: network imitation (distillation) and semi-supervised learning. Our experiments show that the manifold structures are effectively utilized for both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. 
### 159.Automatic Prediction of Building Age from Photographs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02205.pdf)
> We present a first method for the automated age estimation of buildings from unconstrained photographs. To this end, we propose a two-stage approach that firstly learns characteristic visual patterns for different building epochs at patch-level and then globally aggregates patch-level age estimates over the building. We compile evaluation datasets from different sources and perform an detailed evaluation of our approach, its sensitivity to parameters, and the capabilities of the employed deep networks to learn characteristic visual age-related patterns. Results show that our approach is able to estimate building age at a surprisingly high level that even outperforms human evaluators and thereby sets a new performance baseline. This work represents a first step towards the automated assessment of building parameters for automated price prediction. 
### 160.Telepresence System based on Simulated Holographic Display [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02343.pdf)
> We present a telepresence system based on a custom-made simulated holographic display that produces a full 3D model of the remote participants using commodity depth sensors. Our display is composed of a video projector and a quadrangular pyramid made of acrylic, that allows the user to experience an omnidirectional visualization of a remote person without the need for head-mounted displays. To obtain a precise representation of the participants, we fuse together multiple views extracted using a deep background subtraction method. Our system represents an attempt to democratize high-fidelity 3D telepresence using off-the-shelf components. 
### 161.Cross-Domain Image Matching with Deep Feature Maps [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02367.pdf)
> We investigate the problem of automatically determining what type of shoe left an impression found at a crime scene. This recognition problem is made difficult by the variability in types of crime scene evidence (ranging from traces of dust or oil on hard surfaces to impressions made in soil) and the lack of comprehensive databases of shoe outsole tread patterns. We find that mid-level features extracted by pre-trained convolutional neural nets are surprisingly effective descriptors for this specialized domains. However, the choice of similarity measure for matching exemplars to a query image is essential to good performance. For matching multi-channel deep features, we propose the use of multi-channel normalized cross-correlation and analyze its effectiveness. Our proposed metric significantly improves performance in matching crime scene shoeprints to laboratory test impressions. We also show its effectiveness in other cross-domain image retrieval problems: matching facade images to segmentation labels and aerial photos to map images. Finally, we introduce a discriminatively trained variant and fine-tune our system through our proposed metric, obtaining state-of-the-art performance. 
### 162.EPINET: A Fully-Convolutional Neural Network Using Epipolar Geometry for  Depth from Light Field Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02379.pdf)
> Light field cameras capture both the spatial and the angular properties of light rays in space. Due to its property, one can compute the depth from light fields in uncontrolled lighting environments, which is a big advantage over active sensing devices. Depth computed from light fields can be used for many applications including 3D modelling and refocusing. However, light field images from hand-held cameras have very narrow baselines with noise, making the depth estimation difficult. any approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations for the light field depth estimation, but there is a clear trade-off between the accuracy and the speed in these methods. In this paper, we introduce a fast and accurate light field depth estimation method based on a fully-convolutional neural network. Our network is designed by considering the light field geometry and we also overcome the lack of training data by proposing light field specific data augmentation methods. We achieved the top rank in the HCI 4D Light Field Benchmark on most metrics, and we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on real-world light-field images. 
### 163.Learn To Pay Attention [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02391.pdf)
> We propose an end-to-end-trainable attention module for convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures built for image classification. The module takes as input the 2D feature vector maps which form the intermediate representations of the input image at different stages in the CNN pipeline, and outputs a 2D matrix of scores for each map. Standard CNN architectures are modified through the incorporation of this module, and trained under the constraint that a convex combination of the intermediate 2D feature vectors, as parameterised by the score matrices, must \textit{alone} be used for classification. Incentivised to amplify the relevant and suppress the irrelevant or misleading, the scores thus assume the role of attention values. Our experimental observations provide clear evidence to this effect: the learned attention maps neatly highlight the regions of interest while suppressing background clutter. Consequently, the proposed function is able to bootstrap standard CNN architectures for the task of image classification, demonstrating superior generalisation over 6 unseen benchmark datasets. When binarised, our attention maps outperform other CNN-based attention maps, traditional saliency maps, and top object proposals for weakly supervised segmentation as demonstrated on the Object Discovery dataset. We also demonstrate improved robustness against the fast gradient sign method of adversarial attack. 
### 164.Image Segmentation Using Subspace Representation and Sparse  Decomposition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02419.pdf)
> Image foreground extraction is a classical problem in image processing and vision, with a large range of applications. In this dissertation, we focus on the extraction of text and graphics in mixed-content images, and design novel approaches for various aspects of this problem. <br />We first propose a sparse decomposition framework, which models the background by a subspace containing smooth basis vectors, and foreground as a sparse and connected component. We then formulate an optimization framework to solve this problem, by adding suitable regularizations to the cost function to promote the desired characteristics of each component. We present two techniques to solve the proposed optimization problem, one based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and the other one based on robust regression. Promising results are obtained for screen content image segmentation using the proposed algorithm. <br />We then propose a robust subspace learning algorithm for the representation of the background component using training images that could contain both background and foreground components, as well as noise. With the learnt subspace for the background, we can further improve the segmentation results, compared to using a fixed subspace. Lastly, we investigate a different class of signal/image decomposition problem, where only one signal component is active at each signal element. In this case, besides estimating each component, we need to find their supports, which can be specified by a binary mask. We propose a mixed-integer programming problem, that jointly estimates the two components and their supports through an alternating optimization scheme. We show the application of this algorithm on various problems, including image segmentation, video motion segmentation, and also separation of text from textured images. 
### 165.MVSNet: Depth Inference for Unstructured Multi-view Stereo [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02505.pdf)
> We present an end-to-end deep learning architecture for depth map inference from multi-view images. In the network, we first extract deep visual image features, and then build the 3D cost volume upon the reference camera frustum via the differentiable homography warping. Next, we apply 3D convolutions to regularize and regress the initial depth map, which is then refined with the reference image to generate the final output. Our framework flexibly adapts arbitrary N-view inputs using a variance-based cost metric that maps multiple features into one cost feature. The proposed MVSNet is demonstrated on the large-scale indoor DTU dataset. With simple post-processing, our method not only significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts, but also is several times faster in runtime. We also evaluate MVSNet on the complex outdoor Tanks and Temples dataset, where our method ranks first before April 18, 2018 without any fine-tuning, showing the strong generalization ability of MVSNet. 
### 166.Learning a Text-Video Embedding from Incomplete and Heterogeneous Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02516.pdf)
> Joint understanding of video and language is an active research area with many applications. Prior work in this domain typically relies on learning text-video embeddings. One difficulty with this approach, however, is the lack of large-scale annotated video-caption datasets for training. To address this issue, we aim at learning text-video embeddings from heterogeneous data sources. To this end, we propose a Mixture-of-Embedding-Experts (MEE) model with ability to handle missing input modalities during training. As a result, our framework can learn improved text-video embeddings simultaneously from image and video datasets. We also show the generalization of MEE to other input modalities such as face descriptors. We evaluate our method on the task of video retrieval and report results for the MPII Movie Description and MSR-VTT datasets. The proposed MEE model demonstrates significant improvements and outperforms previously reported methods on both text-to-video and video-to-text retrieval tasks. Code is available at: <a href="https://github.com/antoine77340/Mixture-of-Embedding-Experts">this https URL</a> 
### 167.Statistical transformer networks: learning shape and appearance models  via self supervision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02541.pdf)
> We generalise Spatial Transformer Networks (STN) by replacing the parametric transformation of a fixed, regular sampling grid with a deformable, statistical shape model which is itself learnt. We call this a Statistical Transformer Network (StaTN). By training a network containing a StaTN end-to-end for a particular task, the network learns the optimal nonrigid alignment of the input data for the task. Moreover, the statistical shape model is learnt with no direct supervision (such as landmarks) and can be reused for other tasks. Besides training for a specific task, we also show that a StaTN can learn a shape model using generic loss functions. This includes a loss inspired by the minimum description length principle in which an appearance model is also learnt from scratch. In this configuration, our model learns an active appearance model and a means to fit the model from scratch with no supervision at all, even identity labels. 
### 168.Not quite unreasonable effectiveness of machine learning algorithms [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02543.pdf)
> State-of-the-art machine learning algorithms demonstrate close to absolute performance in selected challenges. We provide arguments that the reason can be in low variability of the samples and high effectiveness in learning typical patterns. Due to this fact, standard performance metrics do not reveal model capacity and new metrics are required for the better understanding of state-of-the-art. 
### 169.Efficient No-Reference Quality Assessment and Classification Model for  Contrast Distorted Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02554.pdf)
> In this paper, an efficient Minkowski Distance based Metric (MDM) for no-reference (NR) quality assessment of contrast distorted images is proposed. It is shown that higher orders of Minkowski distance and entropy provide accurate quality prediction for the contrast distorted images. The proposed metric performs predictions by extracting only three features from the distorted images followed by a regression analysis. Furthermore, the proposed features are able to classify type of the contrast distorted images with a high accuracy. Experimental results on four datasets CSIQ, TID2013, CCID2014, and SIQAD show that the proposed metric with a very low complexity provides better quality predictions than the state-of-the-art NR metrics. The MATLAB source code of the proposed metric is available to public at <a href="http://www.synchromedia.ca/system/files/MDM.zip.">this http URL</a> 
### 170.Drive Video Analysis for the Detection of Traffic Near-Miss Incidents [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02555.pdf)
> Because of their recent introduction, self-driving cars and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) equipped vehicles have had little opportunity to learn, the dangerous traffic (including near-miss incident) scenarios that provide normal drivers with strong motivation to drive safely. Accordingly, as a means of providing learning depth, this paper presents a novel traffic database that contains information on a large number of traffic near-miss incidents that were obtained by mounting driving recorders in more than 100 taxis over the course of a decade. The study makes the following two main contributions: (i) In order to assist automated systems in detecting near-miss incidents based on database instances, we created a large-scale traffic near-miss incident database (NIDB) that consists of video clip of dangerous events captured by monocular driving recorders. (ii) To illustrate the applicability of NIDB traffic near-miss incidents, we provide two primary database-related improvements: parameter fine-tuning using various near-miss scenes from NIDB, and foreground/background separation into motion representation. Then, using our new database in conjunction with a monocular driving recorder, we developed a near-miss recognition method that provides automated systems with a performance level that is comparable to a human-level understanding of near-miss incidents (64.5% vs. 68.4% at near-miss recognition, 61.3% vs. 78.7% at near-miss detection). 
### 171.Application of Superpixels to Segment Several Landmarks in Running  Rodents [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02574.pdf)
> Examining locomotion has improved our basic understanding of motor control and aided in treating motor impairment. Mice and rats are the model system of choice for basic neuroscience studies of human disease. High frame rates are needed to quantify the kinematics of running rodents, due to their high stride frequency. Manual tracking, especially for multiple body landmarks, becomes extremely time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we proposed the use of superpixels based image segmentation as superpixels utilized both spatial and color information for segmentation. We segmented some parts of body and tested the success of segmentation as a function of color space and SLIC segment size. We used a simple merging function to connect the segmented regions considered as neighbor and having the same intensity value range. In addition, 28 features were extracted, and t-SNE was used to demonstrate how much the methods are capable to differentiate the regions. Finally, we compared the segmented regions to a manually outlined region. The results showed for segmentation, using the RGB image was slightly better compared to the hue channel. For merg- ing and classification, however, the hue representation was better as it captures the relevant color information in a single channel. 
### 172.POL-LWIR Vehicle Detection: Convolutional Neural Networks Meet Polarised  Infrared Sensors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02576.pdf)
> For vehicle autonomy, driver assistance and situational awareness, it is necessary to operate at day and night, and in all weather conditions. In particular, long wave infrared (LWIR) sensors that receive predominantly emitted radiation have the capability to operate at night as well as during the day. In this work, we employ a polarised LWIR (POL-LWIR) camera to acquire data from a mobile vehicle, to compare and contrast four different convolutional neural network (CNN) configurations to detect other vehicles in video sequences. We evaluate two distinct and promising approaches, two-stage detection (Faster-RCNN) and one-stage detection (SSD), in four different configurations. We also employ two different image decompositions: the first based on the polarisation ellipse and the second on the Stokes parameters themselves. To evaluate our approach, the experimental trials were quantified by mean average precision (mAP) and processing time, showing a clear trade-off between the two factors. For example, the best mAP result of 80.94% was achieved using Faster-RCNN, but at a frame rate of 6.4 fps. In contrast, MobileNet SSD achieved only 64.51% mAP, but at 53.4 fps. 
### 173.Semi-Supervised Multi-Organ Segmentation via Deep Multi-Planar  Co-Training [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02586.pdf)
> In multi-organ segmentation of abdominal CT scans, most existing fully supervised deep learning algorithms require lots of voxel-wise annotations, which are usually difficult, expensive, and slow to obtain. In comparison, massive unlabeled 3D CT volumes are usually easily accessible. Current mainstream works to address the semi-supervised biomedical image segmentation problem are mostly graph-based. By contrast, deep network based semi-supervised learning methods have not drawn much attention in this field. In this work, we propose Deep Multi-Planar Co-Training (DMPCT), whose contributions can be divided into two folds: 1) The deep model is learned in a co-training style which can mine consensus information from multiple planes like the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes; 2) Multi-planar fusion is applied to generate more reliable pseudo-labels, which alleviates the errors occurring in the pseudo-labels and thus can help to train better segmentation networks. Experiments are done on our newly collected large dataset with 100 unlabeled cases as well as 210 labeled cases where 16 anatomical structures are manually annotated by four radiologists and confirmed by a senior expert. The results suggest that DMPCT significantly outperforms the fully supervised method by more than 4% especially when only a small set of annotations is used. 
### 174.Estimation of Camera Locations in Highly Corrupted Scenarios: All About  that Base, No Shape Trouble [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02591.pdf)
> We propose a strategy for improving camera location estimation in structure from motion. Our setting assumes highly corrupted pairwise directions (i.e., normalized relative location vectors), so there is a clear room for improving current state-of-the-art solutions for this problem. Our strategy identifies severely corrupted pairwise directions by using a geometric consistency condition. It then selects a cleaner set of pairwise directions as a preprocessing step for common solvers. We theoretically guarantee the successful performance of a basic version of our strategy under a synthetic corruption model. Numerical results on artificial and real data demonstrate the significant improvement obtained by our strategy. 
### 175.Training Multi-organ Segmentation Networks with Sample Selection by  Relaxed Upper Confident Bound [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02595.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially fully convolutional networks, have been widely applied to automatic medical image segmentation problems, e.g., multi-organ segmentation. Existing CNN-based segmentation methods mainly focus on looking for increasingly powerful network architectures, but pay less attention to data sampling strategies for training networks more effectively. In this paper, we present a simple but effective sample selection method for training multi-organ segmentation networks. Sample selection exhibits an exploitation-exploration strategy, i.e., exploiting hard samples and exploring less frequently visited samples. Based on the fact that very hard samples might have annotation errors, we propose a new sample selection policy, named Relaxed Upper Confident Bound (RUCB). Compared with other sample selection policies, e.g., Upper Confident Bound (UCB), it exploits a range of hard samples rather than being stuck with a small set of very hard ones, which mitigates the influence of annotation errors during training. We apply this new sample selection policy to training a multi-organ segmentation network on a dataset containing 120 abdominal CT scans and show that it boosts segmentation performance significantly. 
### 176.Real-world Noisy Image Denoising: A New Benchmark [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02603.pdf)
> Most of previous image denoising methods focus on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). However,the real-world noisy image denoising problem with the advancing of the computer vision techiniques. In order to promote the study on this problem while implementing the concurrent real-world image denoising datasets, we construct a new benchmark dataset which contains comprehensive real-world noisy images of different natural scenes. These images are captured by different cameras under different camera settings. We evaluate the different denoising methods on our new dataset as well as previous datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the recently proposed methods designed specifically for realistic noise removal based on sparse or low rank theories achieve better denoising performance and are more robust than other competing methods, and the newly proposed dataset is more challenging. The constructed dataset of real photographs is publicly available at \url{<a href="https://github.com/csjunxu/PolyUDataset">this https URL</a>} for researchers to investigate new real-world image denoising methods. We will add more analysis on the noise statistics in the real photographs of our new dataset in the next version of this article. 
### 177.Dimensionality&#x27;s Blessing: Clustering Images by Underlying Distribution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02624.pdf)
> Many high dimensional vector distances tend to a constant. This is typically considered a negative "contrast-loss" phenomenon that hinders clustering and other machine learning techniques. We reinterpret "contrast-loss" as a blessing. Re-deriving "contrast-loss" using the law of large numbers, we show it results in a distribution's instances concentrating on a thin "hyper-shell". The hollow center means apparently chaotically overlapping distributions are actually intrinsically separable. We use this to develop distribution-clustering, an elegant algorithm for grouping of data points by their (unknown) underlying distribution. Distribution-clustering, creates notably clean clusters from raw unlabeled data, estimates the number of clusters for itself and is inherently robust to "outliers" which form their own clusters. This enables trawling for patterns in unorganized data and may be the key to enabling machine intelligence. 
### 178.OATM: Occlusion Aware Template Matching by Consensus Set Maximization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02638.pdf)
> We present a novel approach to template matching that is efficient, can handle partial occlusions, and comes with provable performance guarantees. A key component of the method is a reduction that transforms the problem of searching a nearest neighbor among $N$ high-dimensional vectors, to searching neighbors among two sets of order $\sqrt{N}$ vectors, which can be found efficiently using range search techniques. This allows for a quadratic improvement in search complexity, and makes the method scalable in handling large search spaces. The second contribution is a hashing scheme based on consensus set maximization, which allows us to handle occlusions. The resulting scheme can be seen as a randomized hypothesize-and-test algorithm, which is equipped with guarantees regarding the number of iterations required for obtaining an optimal solution with high probability. The predicted matching rates are validated empirically and the algorithm shows a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art in both speed and robustness to occlusions. 
### 179.Anticipating Traffic Accidents with Adaptive Loss and Large-scale  Incident DB [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02675.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel approach for traffic accident anticipation through (i) Adaptive Loss for Early Anticipation (AdaLEA) and (ii) a large-scale self-annotated incident database for anticipation. The proposed AdaLEA allows a model to gradually learn an earlier anticipation as training progresses. The loss function adaptively assigns penalty weights depending on how early the model can an- ticipate a traffic accident at each epoch. Additionally, we construct a Near-miss Incident DataBase for anticipation. This database contains an enormous number of traffic near- miss incident videos and annotations for detail evaluation of two tasks, risk anticipation and risk-factor anticipation. In our experimental results, we found our proposal achieved the highest scores for risk anticipation (+6.6% better on mean average precision (mAP) and 2.36 sec earlier than previous work on the average time-to-collision (ATTC)) and risk-factor anticipation (+4.3% better on mAP and 0.70 sec earlier than previous work on ATTC). 
### 180.Supervised Convolutional Sparse Coding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02678.pdf)
> Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) is a well-established image representation model especially suited for image restoration tasks. In this work, we extend the applicability of this model by proposing a supervised approach to convolutional sparse coding, which aims at learning discriminative dictionaries instead of purely reconstructive ones. We incorporate a supervised regularization term into the traditional unsupervised CSC objective to encourage the final dictionary elements to be discriminative. Experimental results show that using supervised convolutional learning results in two key advantages. First, we learn more semantically relevant filters in the dictionary and second, we achieve improved image reconstruction on unseen data. 
### 181.Learning-based Video Motion Magnification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02684.pdf)
> Video motion magnification techniques allow us to see small motions previously invisible to the naked eyes, such as those of vibrating airplane wings, or swaying buildings under the influence of the wind. Because the motion is small, the magnification results are prone to noise or excessive blurring. The state of the art relies on hand-designed filters to extract representations that may not be optimal. In this paper, we seek to learn the filters directly from examples using deep convolutional neural networks. To make training tractable, we carefully design a synthetic dataset that captures small motion well, and use two-frame input for training. We show that the learned filters achieve high-quality results on real videos, with less ringing artifacts and better noise characteristics than previous methods. While our model is not trained with temporal filters, we found that the temporal filters can be used with our extracted representations up to a moderate magnification, enabling a frequency-based motion selection. Finally, we analyze the learned filters and show that they behave similarly to the derivative filters used in previous works. Our code, trained model, and datasets will be available online. 
### 182.Fast Single Image Rain Removal via a Deep Decomposition-Composition  Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02688.pdf)
> Rain effect in images typically is annoying for many multimedia and computer vision tasks. For removing rain effect from a single image, deep leaning techniques have been attracting considerable attentions. This paper designs a novel multi-task leaning architecture in an end-to-end manner to reduce the mapping range from input to output and boost the performance. Concretely, a decomposition net is built to split rain images into clean background and rain layers. Different from previous architectures, our model consists of, besides a component representing the desired clean image, an extra component for the rain layer. During the training phase, we further employ a composition structure to reproduce the input by the separated clean image and rain information for improving the quality of decomposition. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images are conducted to reveal the high-quality recovery by our design, and show its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our design is also applicable to other layer decomposition tasks like dust removal. More importantly, our method only requires about 50ms, significantly faster than the competitors, to process a testing image in VGA resolution on a GTX 1080 GPU, making it attractive for practical use. 
### 183.Detecting Multi-Oriented Text with Corner-based Region Proposals [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02690.pdf)
> Previous approaches for scene text detection usually rely on manually defined sliding windows. In this paper, an intuitive region-based method is presented to detect multi-oriented text without any prior knowledge regarding the textual shape. We first introduce a Corner-based Region Proposal Network (CRPN) that employs corners to estimate the possible locations of text instances instead of shifting a set of default anchors. The proposals generated by CRPN are geometry adaptive, which makes our method robust to various text aspect ratios and orientations. Moreover, we design a simple embedded data augmentation module inside the region-wise subnetwork, which not only ensures the model utilizes training data more efficiently, but also learns to find the most representative instance of the input images for training. Experimental results on public benchmarks confirm that the proposed method is capable of achieving comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods. On the ICDAR 2013 and 2015 datasets, it obtains F-measure of 0.876 and 0.845 respectively. The code is publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/xhzdeng/crpn">this https URL</a> 
### 184.Ordinal Pooling Networks: For Preserving Information over Shrinking  Feature Maps [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02702.pdf)
> In the framework of convolutional neural networks that lie at the heart of deep learning, downsampling is often performed with a max-pooling operation that only retains the element with maximum activation, while completely discarding the information contained in other elements in a pooling region. To address this issue, a novel pooling scheme, Ordinal Pooling Network (OPN), is introduced in this work. OPN rearranges all the elements of a pooling region in a sequence and assigns different weights to these elements based upon their orders in the sequence, where the weights are learned via the gradient-based optimisation. The results of our small-scale experiments on image classification task demonstrate that this scheme leads to a consistent improvement in the accuracy over max-pooling operation. This improvement is expected to increase in deeper networks, where several layers of pooling become necessary. 
### 185.Image Segmentation using Sparse Subset Selection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02721.pdf)
> In this paper, we present a new image segmentation method based on the concept of sparse subset selection. Starting with an over-segmentation, we adopt local spectral histogram features to encode the visual information of the small segments into high-dimensional vectors, called superpixel features. Then, the superpixel features are fed into a novel convex model which efficiently leverages the features to group the superpixels into a proper number of coherent regions. Our model automatically determines the optimal number of coherent regions and superpixels assignment to shape final segments. To solve our model, we propose a numerical algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), whose iterations consist of two highly parallelizable sub-problems. We show each sub-problem enjoys closed-form solution which makes the ADMM iterations computationally very efficient. Extensive experiments on benchmark image segmentation datasets demonstrate that our proposed method in combination with an over-segmentation can provide high quality and competitive results compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. 
### 186.Facial Aging and Rejuvenation by Conditional Multi-Adversarial  Autoencoder with Ordinal Regression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02740.pdf)
> Facial aging and facial rejuvenation analyze a given face photograph to predict a future look or estimate a past look of the person. To achieve this, it is critical to preserve human identity and the corresponding aging progression and regression with high accuracy. However, existing methods cannot simultaneously handle these two objectives well. We propose a novel generative adversarial network based approach, named the Conditional Multi-Adversarial AutoEncoder with Ordinal Regression (CMAAE-OR). It utilizes an age estimation technique to control the aging accuracy and takes a high-level feature representation to preserve personalized identity. Specifically, the face is first mapped to a latent vector through a convolutional encoder. The latent vector is then projected onto the face manifold conditional on the age through a deconvolutional generator. The latent vector preserves personalized face features and the age controls facial aging and rejuvenation. A discriminator and an ordinal regression are imposed on the encoder and the generator in tandem, making the generated face images to be more photorealistic while simultaneously exhibiting desirable aging effects. Besides, a high-level feature representation is utilized to preserve personalized identity of the generated face. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate appealing performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art. 
### 187.Direct Estimation of Pharmacokinetic Parameters from DCE-MRI using Deep  CNN with Forward Physical Model Loss [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02745.pdf)
> Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is an evolving imaging technique that provides a quantitative measure of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in body tissues, in which series of T1-weighted images are collected following the administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent. Unfortunately, in many applications, conventional clinical DCE-MRI suffers from low spatiotemporal resolution and insufficient volume coverage. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based approach to directly estimate the PK parameters from undersampled DCE-MRI data. Specifically, we design a custom loss function where we incorporate a forward physical model that relates the PK parameters to corrupted image-time series obtained due to subsampling in k-space. This allows the network to directly exploit the knowledge of true contrast agent kinetics in the training phase, and hence provide more accurate restoration of PK parameters. Experiments on clinical brain DCE datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of fidelity of PK parameter reconstruction and significantly faster parameter inference compared to a model-based iterative reconstruction method. 
### 188.Scaling Egocentric Vision: The EPIC-KITCHENS Dataset [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02748.pdf)
> First-person vision is gaining interest as it offers a unique viewpoint on people's interaction with objects, their attention, and even intention. However, progress in this challenging domain has been relatively slow due to the lack of sufficiently large datasets. In this paper, we introduce EPIC-KITCHENS, a large-scale egocentric video benchmark recorded by 32 participants in their native kitchen environments. Our videos depict nonscripted daily activities: we simply asked each participant to start recording every time they entered their kitchen. Recording took place in 4 cities (in North America and Europe) by participants belonging to 10 different nationalities, resulting in highly diverse cooking styles. Our dataset features 55 hours of video consisting of 11.5M frames, which we densely labeled for a total of 39.6K action segments and 454.3K object bounding boxes. Our annotation is unique in that we had the participants narrate their own videos (after recording), thus reflecting true intention, and we crowd-sourced ground-truths based on these. We describe our object, action and anticipation challenges, and evaluate several baselines over two test splits, seen and unseen kitchens.

### 189.DeepASL: Kinetic Model Incorporated Loss for Denoising Arterial Spin  Labeled MRI via Deep Residual Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02755.pdf)
> Arterial spin labeling (ASL) allows to quantify the cerebral blood flow (CBF) by magnetic labeling of the arterial blood water. ASL is increasingly used in clinical studies due to its noninvasiveness, repeatability and benefits in quantification. However, ASL suffers from an inherently low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requiring repeated measurements of control/spin-labeled (C/L) pairs to achieve a reasonable image quality, which in return increases motion sensitivity. This leads to clinically prolonged scanning times increasing the risk of motion artifacts. Thus, there is an immense need of advanced imaging and processing techniques in ASL. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based approach to improve the perfusion-weighted image quality obtained from a subset of all available pairwise C/L subtractions. Specifically, we train a deep fully convolutional network (FCN) to learn a mapping from noisy perfusion-weighted image and its subtraction (residual) from the clean image. Additionally, we incorporate the CBF estimation model in the loss function during training, which enables the network to produce high quality images while simultaneously enforcing the CBF estimates to be as close as reference CBF values. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical ASL datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of improved ASL image quality, accurate CBF parameter estimation and considerably small computation time during testing. 
### 190.YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02767.pdf)
> We present some updates to YOLO! We made a bunch of little design changes to make it better. We also trained this new network that's pretty swell. It's a little bigger than last time but more accurate. It's still fast though, don't worry. At 320x320 YOLOv3 runs in 22 ms at 28.2 mAP, as accurate as SSD but three times faster. When we look at the old .5 IOU mAP detection metric YOLOv3 is quite good. It achieves 57.9 mAP@50 in 51 ms on a Titan X, compared to 57.5 mAP@50 in 198 ms by RetinaNet, similar performance but 3.8x faster.

### 191.Estimating Depth from RGB and Sparse Sensing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02771.pdf)
> We present a deep model that can accurately produce dense depth maps given an RGB image with known depth at a very sparse set of pixels. The model works simultaneously for both indoor/outdoor scenes and produces state-of-the-art dense depth maps at nearly real-time speeds on both the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets. We surpass the state-of-the-art for monocular depth estimation even with depth values for only 1 out of every ~10000 image pixels, and we outperform other sparse-to-dense depth methods at all sparsity levels. With depth values for 1/256 of the image pixels, we achieve a mean absolute error of less than 1% of actual depth on indoor scenes, comparable to the performance of consumer-grade depth sensor hardware. Our experiments demonstrate that it would indeed be possible to efficiently transform sparse depth measurements obtained using e.g. lower-power depth sensors or SLAM systems into high-quality dense depth maps. 
### 192.Occluded Person Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02792.pdf)
> Person re-identification (re-id) suffers from a serious occlusion problem when applied to crowded public places. In this paper, we propose to retrieve a full-body person image by using a person image with occlusions. This differs significantly from the conventional person re-id problem where it is assumed that person images are detected without any occlusion. We thus call this new problem the occluded person re-identitification. To address this new problem, we propose a novel Attention Framework of Person Body (AFPB) based on deep learning, consisting of 1) an Occlusion Simulator (OS) which automatically generates artificial occlusions for full-body person images, and 2) multi-task losses that force the neural network not only to discriminate a person's identity but also to determine whether a sample is from the occluded data distribution or the full-body data distribution. Experiments on a new occluded person re-id dataset and three existing benchmarks modified to include full-body person images and occluded person images show the superiority of the proposed method. 
### 193.A Novel Multi-Task Tensor Correlation Neural Network for Facial  Attribute Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02810.pdf)
> Face multi-attribute prediction benefits substantially from multi-task learning (MTL), which learns multiple face attributes simultaneously to achieve shared or mutually related representations of different attributes. The most widely used MTL convolutional neural network is heuristically or empirically designed by sharing all of the convolutional layers and splitting at the fully connected layers for task-specific losses. However, it is improper to view all low and mid-level features for different attributes as being the same, especially when these attributes are only loosely related. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-attribute tensor correlation neural network (MTCN) for face attribute prediction. The structure shares the information in low-level features (e.g., the first two convolutional layers) but splits that in high-level features (e.g., from the third convolutional layer to the fully connected layer). At the same time, during high-level feature extraction, each subnetwork (e.g., Age-Net, Gender-Net, ..., and Smile-Net) excavates closely related features from other networks to enhance its features. Then, we project the features of the C9 layers of the fine-tuned subnetworks into a highly correlated space by using a novel tensor correlation analysis algorithm (NTCCA). The final face attribute prediction is made based on the correlation matrix. Experimental results on benchmarks with multiple face attributes (CelebA and LFWA) show that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. 
### 194.Recovering Realistic Texture in Image Super-resolution by Deep Spatial  Feature Transform [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02815.pdf)
> Despite that convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently demonstrated high-quality reconstruction for single-image super-resolution (SR), recovering natural and realistic texture remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we show that it is possible to recover textures faithful to semantic classes. In particular, we only need to modulate features of a few intermediate layers in a single network conditioned on semantic segmentation probability maps. This is made possible through a novel Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) layer that generates affine transformation parameters for spatial-wise feature modulation. SFT layers can be trained end-to-end together with the SR network using the same loss function. During testing, it accepts an input image of arbitrary size and generates a high-resolution image with just a single forward pass conditioned on the categorical priors. Our final results show that an SR network equipped with SFT can generate more realistic and visually pleasing textures in comparison to state-of-the-art SRGAN and EnhanceNet. 
### 195.Composing photomosaic images using clustering based evolutionary  programming [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02827.pdf)
> Photomosaic images are a type of images consisting of various tiny images. A complete form can be seen clearly by viewing it from a long distance. Small tiny images which replace blocks of the original image can be seen clearly by viewing it from a short distance. In the past, many algorithms have been proposed trying to automatically compose photomosaic images. Most of these algorithms are designed with greedy algorithms to match the blocks with the tiny images. To obtain a better visual sense and satisfy some commercial requirements, a constraint that a tiny image should not be repeatedly used many times is usually added. With the constraint, the photomosaic problem becomes a combinatorial optimization problem. Evolutionary algorithms imitating the process of natural selection are popular and powerful in combinatorial optimization problems. However, little work has been done on applying evolutionary algorithms to photomosaic problem. In this paper, we present an algorithm called clustering based evolutionary programming to deal with the problem. We give prior knowledge to the optimization algorithm which makes the optimization process converges faster. In our experiment, the proposed algorithm is compared with the state of the art algorithms and software. The results indicate that our algorithm performs the best. 
### 196.Photometric Stereo in Participating Media Considering Shape-Dependent  Forward Scatter [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02836.pdf)
> Images captured in participating media such as murky water, fog, or smoke are degraded by scattered light. Thus, the use of traditional three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques in such environments is difficult. In this paper, we propose a photometric stereo method for participating media. The proposed method differs from previous studies with respect to modeling shape-dependent forward scatter. In the proposed model, forward scatter is described as an analytical form using lookup tables and is represented by spatially-variant kernels. We also propose an approximation of a large-scale dense matrix as a sparse matrix, which enables the removal of forward scatter. Experiments with real and synthesized data demonstrate that the proposed method improves 3D reconstruction in participating media. 
### 197.Viewpoint-aware Video Summarization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02843.pdf)
> This paper introduces a novel variant of video summarization, namely building a summary that depends on the particular aspect of a video the viewer focuses on. We refer to this as $\textit{viewpoint}$. To infer what the desired $\textit{viewpoint}$ may be, we assume that several other videos are available, especially groups of videos, e.g., as folders on a person's phone or laptop. The semantic similarity between videos in a group vs. the dissimilarity between groups is used to produce $\textit{viewpoint}$-specific summaries. For considering similarity as well as avoiding redundancy, output summary should be (A) diverse, (B) representative of videos in the same group, and (C) discriminative against videos in the different groups. To satisfy these requirements (A)-(C) simultaneously, we proposed a novel video summarization method from multiple groups of videos. Inspired by Fisher's discriminant criteria, it selects summary by optimizing the combination of three terms (a) inner-summary, (b) inner-group, and (c) between-group variances defined on the feature representation of summary, which can simply represent (A)-(C). Moreover, we developed a novel dataset to investigate how well the generated summary reflects the underlying $\textit{viewpoint}$. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. 
### 198.Semantic Edge Detection with Diverse Deep Supervision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02864.pdf)
> Semantic edge detection (SED), which aims at jointly extracting edges as well as their category information, has far-reaching applications in domains such as semantic segmentation, object proposal generation, and object recognition. SED naturally requires achieving two distinct supervision targets: locating fine detailed edges and identifying high-level semantics. We shed light on how such distracted supervision targets prevent state-of-the-art SED methods from effectively using deep supervision to improve results. In this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional neural network architecture using diverse deep supervision (DDS) within a multi-task framework where lower layers aim at generating category-agnostic edges, while higher layers are responsible for the detection of category-aware semantic edges. To overcome the distracted supervision challenge, a novel information converter unit is introduced, whose effectiveness has been extensively evaluated in several popular benchmark datasets, including SBD, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC2012. Source code will be released upon paper acceptance. 
### 199.Variational 3D-PIV with Sparse Descriptors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02872.pdf)
> 3D Particle Imaging Velocimetry (3D-PIV) aim to recover the flow field in a volume of fluid, which has been seeded with tracer particles and observed from multiple camera viewpoints. The first step of 3D-PIV is to reconstruct the 3D locations of the tracer particles from synchronous views of the volume. We propose a new method for iterative particle reconstruction (IPR), in which the locations and intensities of all particles are inferred in one joint energy minimization. The energy function is designed to penalize deviations between the reconstructed 3D particles and the image evidence, while at the same time aiming for a sparse set of particles. We find that the new method, without any post-processing, achieves significantly cleaner particle volumes than a conventional, tomographic MART reconstruction, and can handle a wide range of particle densities. The second step of 3D-PIV is to then recover the dense motion field from two consecutive particle reconstructions. We propose a variational model, which makes it possible to directly include physical properties, such as incompressibility and viscosity, in the estimation of the motion field. To further exploit the sparse nature of the input data, we propose a novel, compact descriptor of the local particle layout. Hence, we avoid the memory-intensive storage of high-resolution intensity volumes. Our framework is generic and allows for a variety of different data costs (correlation measures) and regularizers. We quantitatively evaluate it with both the sum of squared differences (SSD) and the normalized cross-correlation (NCC), respectively with both a hard and a soft version of the incompressibility constraint. 
### 200.A Fully Progressive Approach to Single-Image Super-Resolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02900.pdf)
> Recent deep learning approaches to single image super-resolution have achieved impressive results in terms of traditional error measures and perceptual quality. However, in each case it remains challenging to achieve high quality results for large upsampling factors. To this end, we propose a method (ProSR) that is progressive both in architecture and training: the network upsamples an image in intermediate steps, while the learning process is organized from easy to hard, as is done in curriculum learning. To obtain more photorealistic results, we design a generative adversarial network (GAN), named ProGanSR, that follows the same progressive multi-scale design principle. This not only allows to scale well to high upsampling factors (e.g., 8x) but constitutes a principled multi-scale approach that increases the reconstruction quality for all upsampling factors simultaneously. In particular ProSR ranks 2nd in terms of SSIM and 4th in terms of PSNR in the NTIRE2018 SISR challenge [34]. Compared to the top-ranking team, our model is marginally lower, but runs 5 times faster. 
### 201.Bringing Alive Blurred Moments! [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02913.pdf)
> We present a solution for the novel goal of extracting a video from a single blurred image to sequentially reconstruct the views of a scene as beheld by the camera during the time of exposure. We approach this task by first learning a motion representation for videos in an unsupervised manner through training of a novel video autoencoder network that performs a surrogate task of video reconstruction. Instead of enforc- ing temporal constraints on features learned at the image level, we em- ploy a recurrent design with convolutional filters to directly learn tempo- rally correlated representations. Once trained, this network is employed for the guided training of a motion encoder for blurred images. This net- work extracts embedded motion information from a single blurred image so as to generate a sharp video in conjunction with the trained recur- rent video decoder. Experiments on real scenes and standard data-sets demonstrate our framework's ability to generate a plausible sequence of sharp frames. 
### 202.Distribution-Aware Binarization of Neural Networks for Sketch  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02941.pdf)
> Deep neural networks are highly effective at a range of computational tasks. However, they tend to be computationally expensive, especially in vision-related problems, and also have large memory requirements. One of the most effective methods to achieve significant improvements in computational/spatial efficiency is to binarize the weights and activations in a network. However, naive binarization results in accuracy drops when applied to networks for most tasks. In this work, we present a highly generalized, distribution-aware approach to binarizing deep networks that allows us to retain the advantages of a binarized network, while reducing accuracy drops. We also develop efficient implementations for our proposed approach across different architectures. We present a theoretical analysis of the technique to show the effective representational power of the resulting layers, and explore the forms of data they model best. Experiments on popular datasets show that our technique offers better accuracies than naive binarization, while retaining the same benefits that binarization provides - with respect to run-time compression, reduction of computational costs, and power consumption. 
### 203.Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Segmentation with a Small Number of Training  Subjects [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02943.pdf)
> Pre-operative Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) 3D shape is critical for customized stent-graft design in Fenestrated Endovascular Aortic Repair (FEVAR). Traditional segmentation approaches implement expert-designed feature extractors while recent deep neural networks extract features automatically with multiple non-linear modules. Usually, a large training dataset is essential for applying deep learning on AAA segmentation. In this paper, the AAA was segmented using U-net with a small number (two) of training subjects. Firstly, Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) slices were augmented with gray value variation and translation to avoid the overfitting caused by the small number of training subjects. Then, U-net was trained to segment the AAA. Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) over 0.8 were achieved on the testing subjects. The PLZ, DLZ and aortic branches are all reconstructed reasonably, which will facilitate stent graft customization and help shape instantiation for intra-operative surgery navigation in FEVAR. 
### 204.Generative Adversarial Networks for Extreme Learned Image Compression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02958.pdf)
> We propose a framework for extreme learned image compression based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), obtaining visually pleasing images at significantly lower bitrates than previous methods. This is made possible through our GAN formulation of learned compression combined with a generator/decoder which operates on the full-resolution image and is trained in combination with a multi-scale discriminator. Additionally, our method can fully synthesize unimportant regions in the decoded image such as streets and trees from a semantic label map extracted from the original image, therefore only requiring the storage of the preserved region and the semantic label map. A user study confirms that for low bitrates, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, saving up to 67% compared to the next-best method BPG. 
### 205.HyperDense-Net: A hyper-densely connected CNN for multi-modal image  segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02967.pdf)
> Recently, dense connections have attracted substantial attention in computer vision because they facilitate gradient flow and implicit deep supervision during training. Particularly, DenseNet, which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion, has shown impressive performances in natural image classification tasks. We propose HyperDenseNet, a 3D fully convolutional neural network that extends the definition of dense connectivity to multi-modal segmentation problems. Each imaging modality has a path, and dense connections occur not only between the pairs of layers within the same path, but also between those across different paths. This contrasts with the existing multi-modal CNN approaches, in which modeling several modalities relies entirely on a single joint layer (or level of abstraction) for fusion, typically either at the input or at the output of the network. Therefore, the proposed network has total freedom to learn more complex combinations between the modalities, within and in-between all the levels of abstraction, which increases significantly the learning representation. We report extensive evaluations over two different and highly competitive multi-modal brain tissue segmentation challenges, iSEG 2017 and MRBrainS 2013, with the former focusing on 6-month infant data and the latter on adult images. HyperDenseNet yielded significant improvements over many state-of-the-art segmentation networks, ranking at the top on both benchmarks. We further provide a comprehensive experimental analysis of features re-use, which confirms the importance of hyper-dense connections in multi-modal representation learning.

### 206.Face Sketch Synthesis Style Similarity:A New Structure Co-occurrence  Texture Measure [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02975.pdf)
> Existing face sketch synthesis (FSS) similarity measures are sensitive to slight image degradation (e.g., noise, blur). However, human perception of the similarity of two sketches will consider both structure and texture as essential factors and is not sensitive to slight ("pixel-level") mismatches. Consequently, the use of existing similarity measures can lead to better algorithms receiving a lower score than worse algorithms. This unreliable evaluation has significantly hindered the development of the FSS field. To solve this problem, we propose a novel and robust style similarity measure called Scoot-measure (Structure CO-Occurrence Texture Measure), which simultaneously evaluates "block-level" spatial structure and co-occurrence texture statistics. In addition, we further propose 4 new meta-measures and create 2 new datasets to perform a comprehensive evaluation of several widely-used FSS measures on two large databases. Experimental results demonstrate that our measure not only provides a reliable evaluation but also achieves significantly improved performance. Specifically, the study indicated a higher degree (78.8%) of correlation between our measure and human judgment than the best prior measure (58.6%). Our code will be made available. 
### 207.Multi-views Fusion CNN for Left Ventricular Volumes Estimation on  Cardiac MR Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03008.pdf)
> Left ventricular (LV) volumes estimation is a critical procedure for cardiac disease diagnosis. The objective of this paper is to address direct LV volumes prediction task. Methods: In this paper, we propose a direct volumes prediction method based on the end-to-end deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). We study the end-to-end LV volumes prediction method in items of the data preprocessing, networks structure, and multi-views fusion strategy. The main contributions of this paper are the following aspects. First, we propose a new data preprocessing method on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Second, we propose a new networks structure for end-to-end LV volumes estimation. Third, we explore the representational capacity of different slices, and propose a fusion strategy to improve the prediction accuracy. Results: The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art LV volumes estimation methods on the open accessible benchmark datasets. The clinical indexes derived from the predicted volumes agree well with the ground truth (EDV: R2=0.974, RMSE=9.6ml; ESV: R2=0.976, RMSE=7.1ml; EF: R2=0.828, RMSE =4.71%). Conclusion: Experimental results prove that the proposed method may be useful for LV volumes prediction task. Significance: The proposed method not only has application potential for cardiac diseases screening for large-scale CMR data, but also can be extended to other medical image research fields 
### 208.3D Fluid Flow Estimation with Integrated Particle Reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03037.pdf)
> The standard approach to densely reconstruct the motion in a volume of fluid is to inject high-contrast tracer particles and record their motion with multiple high-speed cameras. Almost all existing work processes the acquired multi-view video in two separate steps: first, a per-frame reconstruction of the particles, usually in the form of soft occupancy likelihoods in a voxel representation; followed by 3D motion estimation, with some form of dense matching between the precomputed voxel grids from different time steps. In this sequential procedure, the first step cannot use temporal consistency considerations to support the reconstruction, while the second step has no access to the original, high-resolution image data. We show, for the first time, how to jointly reconstruct both the individual tracer particles and a dense 3D fluid motion field from the image data, using an integrated energy minimization. Our hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian model explicitly reconstructs individual particles, and at the same time recovers a dense 3D motion field in the entire domain. Making particles explicit greatly reduces the memory consumption and allows one to use the high-resolution input images for matching. Whereas the dense motion field makes it possible to include physical a-priori constraints and account for the incompressibility and viscosity of the fluid. The method exhibits greatly (~70%) improved results over a recent baseline with two separate steps for 3D reconstruction and motion estimation. Our results with only two time steps are comparable to those of state-of-the-art tracking-based methods that require much longer sequences. 
### 209.Binge Watching: Scaling Affordance Learning from Sitcoms [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03080.pdf)
> In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in jointly modeling perception and action. At the core of this investigation is the idea of modeling affordances(Affordances are opportunities of interaction in the scene. In other words, it represents what actions can the object be used for). However, when it comes to predicting affordances, even the state of the art approaches still do not use any ConvNets. Why is that? Unlike semantic or 3D tasks, there still does not exist any large-scale dataset for affordances. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of creating one of the biggest dataset for learning affordances. We use seven sitcoms to extract a diverse set of scenes and how actors interact with different objects in the scenes. Our dataset consists of more than 10K scenes and 28K ways humans can interact with these 10K images. We also propose a two-step approach to predict affordances in a new scene. In the first step, given a location in the scene we classify which of the 30 pose classes is the likely affordance pose. Given the pose class and the scene, we then use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to extract the scale and deformation of the pose. The VAE allows us to sample the distribution of possible poses at test time. Finally, we show the importance of large-scale data in learning a generalizable and robust model of affordances. 
### 210.Attribute-Centered Loss for Soft-Biometrics Guided Face Sketch-Photo  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03082.pdf)
> Face sketches are able to capture the spatial topology of a face while lacking some facial attributes such as race, skin, or hair color. Existing sketch-photo recognition approaches have mostly ignored the importance of facial attributes. In this paper, we propose a new loss function, called attribute-centered loss, to train a Deep Coupled Convolutional Neural Network (DCCNN) for the facial attribute guided sketch to photo matching. Specifically, an attribute-centered loss is proposed which learns several distinct centers, in a shared embedding space, for photos and sketches with different combinations of attributes. The DCCNN simultaneously is trained to map photos and pairs of testified attributes and corresponding forensic sketches around their associated centers, while preserving the spatial topology information. Importantly, the centers learn to keep a relative distance from each other, related to their number of contradictory attributes. Extensive experiments are performed on composite (E-PRIP) and semi-forensic (IIIT-D Semi-forensic) databases. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. 
### 211.Blazingly Fast Video Object Segmentation with Pixel-Wise Metric Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03131.pdf)
> This paper tackles the problem of video object segmentation, given some user annotation which indicates the object of interest. The problem is formulated as pixel-wise retrieval in a learned embedding space: we embed pixels of the same object instance into the vicinity of each other, using a fully convolutional network trained by a modified triplet loss as the embedding model. Then the annotated pixels are set as reference and the rest of the pixels are classified using a nearest-neighbor approach. The proposed method supports different kinds of user input such as segmentation mask in the first frame (semi-supervised scenario), or a sparse set of clicked points (interactive scenario). In the semi-supervised scenario, we achieve results competitive with the state of the art but at a fraction of computation cost (275 milliseconds per frame). In the interactive scenario where the user is able to refine their input iteratively, the proposed method provides instant response to each input, and reaches comparable quality to competing methods with much less interaction. 
### 212.Markerless tracking of user-defined features with deep learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03142.pdf)
> Quantifying behavior is crucial for many applications in neuroscience. Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies, humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with computer-based tracking, yet markers are intrusive (especially for smaller animals), and the number and location of the markers must be determined a priori. Here, we present a highly efficient method for markerless tracking based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in a broad collection of experimental settings: mice odor trail-tracking, egg-laying behavior in drosophila, and mouse hand articulation in a skilled forelimb task. For example, during the skilled reaching behavior, individual joints can be automatically tracked (and a confidence score is reported). Remarkably, even when a small number of frames are labeled ($\approx 200$), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy. 
### 213.The Sound of Pixels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03160.pdf)
> We introduce PixelPlayer, a system that, by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled videos, learns to locate image regions which produce sounds and separate the input sounds into a set of components that represents the sound from each pixel. Our approach capitalizes on the natural synchronization of the visual and audio modalities to learn models that jointly parse sounds and images, without requiring additional manual supervision. Experimental results on a newly collected MUSIC dataset show that our proposed Mix-and-Separate framework outperforms several baselines on source separation. Qualitative results suggest our model learns to ground sounds in vision, enabling applications such as independently adjusting the volume of sound sources. 
### 214.$\mathcal{G}$-Distillation: Reducing Overconfident Errors on Novel  Samples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03166.pdf)
> Counter to the intuition that unfamiliarity should lead to lack of confidence, current algorithms often make highly confident yet wrong predictions when faced with unexpected test samples from an unknown distribution different from training. Unlike all domain adaptation methods, we cannot gather an "unexpected dataset" prior to test. We propose a simple solution that reduces overconfident errors of samples from an unknown novel distribution without increasing evaluation time: train an ensemble of classifiers and then distill into a single model using both labeled and unlabeled examples. Experimentally, we investigate the overconfidence problem and evaluate our solution by creating "familiar" and "novel" test splits, where "familiar" are identically distributed with training and "novel" are not. We show that our solution yields more appropriate prediction confidences, on familiar and novel data, compared to single models and ensembles distilled on training data only. For example, we reduce confident errors in gender recognition by 94% on demographic groups different from the training data. 
### 215.Exploiting Partial Structural Symmetry For Patient-Specific Image  Augmentation in Trauma Interventions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03224.pdf)
> In unilateral pelvic fracture reductions, surgeons attempt to reconstruct the bone fragments such that bilateral symmetry in the bony anatomy is restored. We propose to exploit this "structurally symmetric" nature of the pelvic bone, and provide intra-operative image augmentation to assist the surgeon in repairing dislocated fragments. The main challenge is to automatically estimate the desired plane of symmetry within the patient's pre-operative CT. We propose to estimate this plane using a non-linear optimization strategy, by minimizing Tukey's biweight robust estimator, relying on the partial symmetry of the anatomy. Moreover, a regularization term is designed to enforce the similarity of bone density histograms on both sides of this plane, relying on the biological fact that, even if injured, the dislocated bone segments remain within the body. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in estimating this "plane of partial symmetry" using CT images of both healthy and injured anatomy. Examples of unilateral pelvic fractures are used to show how intra-operative X-ray images could be augmented with the forward-projections of the mirrored anatomy, acting as objective road-map for fracture reduction procedures. 
### 216.NetAdapt: Platform-Aware Neural Network Adaptation for Mobile  Applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03230.pdf)
> This work proposes an automated algorithm, called NetAdapt, that adapts a pre-trained deep neural network to a mobile platform given a resource budget. While many existing algorithms simplify networks based on the number of MACs or the number of parameters, optimizing those indirect metrics may not necessarily reduce the direct metrics, such as latency and energy consumption. To solve this problem, NetAdapt incorporates direct metrics into its adaptation algorithm. These direct metrics are evaluated using empirical measurements, so that detailed knowledge of the platform and toolchain is not required. NetAdapt automatically and progressively simplifies a pre-trained network until the resource budget (e.g., latency) is met while maximizing the accuracy. Experiment results show that NetAdapt achieves better accuracy versus latency trade-offs on both mobile CPU and mobile GPU, compared with the state-of-the-art automated network simplification algorithms. For image classification on the ImageNet dataset, NetAdapt achieves up to a 1.66$\times$ speedup in measured inference latency with higher accuracy. 
### 217.Fine-grained Activity Recognition in Baseball Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03247.pdf)
> In this paper, we introduce a challenging new dataset, MLB-YouTube, designed for fine-grained activity detection. The dataset contains two settings: segmented video classification as well as activity detection in continuous videos. We experimentally compare various recognition approaches capturing temporal structure in activity videos, by classifying segmented videos and extending those approaches to continuous videos. We also compare models on the extremely difficult task of predicting pitch speed and pitch type from broadcast baseball videos. We find that learning temporal structure is valuable for fine-grained activity recognition. 
### 218.Towards Deep Cellular Phenotyping in Placental Histology [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03270.pdf)
> The placenta is a complex organ, playing multiple roles during fetal development. Very little is known about the association between placental morphological abnormalities and fetal physiology. In this work, we present an open sourced, computationally tractable deep learning pipeline to analyse placenta histology at the level of the cell. By utilising two deep Convolutional Neural Network architectures and transfer learning, we can robustly localise and classify placental cells within five classes with an accuracy of 89%. Furthermore, we learn deep embeddings encoding phenotypic knowledge that is capable of both stratifying five distinct cell populations and learn intraclass phenotypic variance. We envisage that the automation of this pipeline to population scale studies of placenta histology has the potential to improve our understanding of basic cellular placental biology and its variations, particularly its role in predicting adverse birth outcomes. 
### 219.Recurrent Neural Networks for Person Re-identification Revisited [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03281.pdf)
> The task of person re-identification has recently received rising attention due to the high performance achieved by new methods based on deep learning. In particular, in the context of video-based re-identification, many state-of-the-art works have explored the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process input sequences. In this work, we revisit this tool by deriving an approximation which reveals the small effect of recurrent connections, leading to a much simpler feed-forward architecture. Using the same parameters as the recurrent version, our proposed feed-forward architecture obtains very similar accuracy. More importantly, our model can be combined with a new training process to significantly improve re-identification performance. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed models converge substantially faster than recurrent ones, with accuracy improvements by up to 5% on two datasets. The performance achieved is better or on par with other RNN-based person re-identification techniques. 
### 220.On the Robustness of the CVPR 2018 White-Box Adversarial Example  Defenses [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03286.pdf)
> Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this note, we evaluate the two white-box defenses that appeared at CVPR 2018 and find they are ineffective: when applying existing techniques, we can reduce the accuracy of the defended models to 0%. 
### 221.Understanding Humans in Crowded Scenes: Deep Nested Adversarial Learning  and A New Benchmark for Multi-Human Parsing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03287.pdf)
> Despite the noticeable progress in perceptual tasks like detection, instance segmentation and human parsing, computers still perform unsatisfactorily on visually understanding humans in crowded scenes, such as group behavior analysis, person re-identification and autonomous driving, etc. To this end, models need to comprehensively perceive the semantic information and the differences between instances in a multi-human image, which is recently defined as the multi-human parsing task. In this paper, we present a new large-scale database "Multi-Human Parsing (MHP)" for algorithm development and evaluation, and advances the state-of-the-art in understanding humans in crowded scenes. MHP contains 25,403 elaborately annotated images with 58 fine-grained semantic category labels, involving 2-26 persons per image and captured in real-world scenes from various viewpoints, poses, occlusion, interactions and background. We further propose a novel deep Nested Adversarial Network (NAN) model for multi-human parsing. NAN consists of three Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-like sub-nets, respectively performing semantic saliency prediction, instance-agnostic parsing and instance-aware clustering. These sub-nets form a nested structure and are carefully designed to learn jointly in an end-to-end way. NAN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions on our MHP and several other datasets, and serves as a strong baseline to drive the future research for multi-human parsing. 
### 222.Crafting a Toolchain for Image Restoration by Deep Reinforcement  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03312.pdf)
> We investigate a novel approach for image restoration by reinforcement learning. Unlike existing studies that mostly train a single large network for a specialized task, we prepare a toolbox consisting of small-scale convolutional networks of different complexities and specialized in different tasks. Our method, RL-Restore, then learns a policy to select appropriate tools from the toolbox to progressively restore the quality of a corrupted image. We formulate a step-wise reward function proportional to how well the image is restored at each step to learn the action policy. We also devise a joint learning scheme to train the agent and tools for better performance in handling uncertainty. In comparison to conventional human-designed networks, RL-Restore is capable of restoring images corrupted with complex and unknown distortions in a more parameter-efficient manner using the dynamically formed toolchain. 
### 223.Modular Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03343.pdf)
> Existing methods for multi-domain image-to-image translation (or generation) attempt to directly map an input image (or a random vector) to an image in one of the output domains. However, most existing methods have limited scalability and robustness, since they require building independent models for each pair of domains in question. This leads to two significant shortcomings: (1) the need to train exponential number of pairwise models, and (2) the inability to leverage data from other domains when training a particular pairwise mapping. Inspired by recent work on module networks, this paper proposes ModularGAN for multi-domain image generation and image-to-image translation. ModularGAN consists of several reusable and composable modules that carry on different functions (e.g., encoding, decoding, transformations). These modules can be trained simultaneously, leveraging data from all domains, and then combined to construct specific GAN networks at test time, according to the specific image translation task. This leads to ModularGAN's superior flexibility of generating (or translating to) an image in any desired domain. Experimental results demonstrate that our model not only presents compelling perceptual results but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multi-domain facial attribute transfer. 
### 224.Mean Field Network based Graph Refinement with application to Airway  Tree Extraction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03348.pdf)
> We present tree extraction in 3D images as a graph refinement task, of obtaining a subgraph from an over-complete input graph. To this end, we formulate an approximate Bayesian inference framework on undirected graphs using mean field approximation (MFA). Mean field networks are used for inference based on the interpretation that iterations of MFA can be seen as feed-forward operations in a neural network. This allows us to learn the model parameters from training data using back-propagation algorithm. We demonstrate usefulness of the model to extract airway trees from 3D chest CT data. We first obtain probability images using a voxel classifier that distinguishes airways from background and use Bayesian smoothing to model individual airway branches. This yields us joint Gaussian density estimates of position, orientation and scale as node features of the input graph. Performance of the method is compared with two methods: the first uses probability images from a trained voxel classifier with region growing, which is similar to one of the best performing methods at EXACT'09 airway challenge, and the second method is based on Bayesian smoothing on these probability images. Using centerline distance as error measure the presented method shows significant improvement compared to these two methods. 
### 225.Reference-Conditioned Super-Resolution by Neural Texture Transfer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03360.pdf)
> With the recent advancement in deep learning, we have witnessed a great progress in single image super-resolution. However, due to the significant information loss of the image downscaling process, it has become extremely challenging to further advance the state-of-the-art, especially for large upscaling factors. This paper explores a new research direction in super resolution, called reference-conditioned super-resolution, in which a reference image containing desired high-resolution texture details is provided besides the low-resolution image. We focus on transferring the high-resolution texture from reference images to the super-resolution process without the constraint of content similarity between reference and target images, which is a key difference from previous example-based methods. Inspired by recent work on image stylization, we address the problem via neural texture transfer. We design an end-to-end trainable deep model which generates detail enriched results by adaptively fusing the content from the low-resolution image with the texture patterns from the reference image. We create a benchmark dataset for the general research of reference-based super-resolution, which contains reference images paired with low-resolution inputs with varying degrees of similarity. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the great potential of using reference images as well as the superiority of our results over other state-of-the-art methods. 
### 226.Learning an Optimizer for Image Deconvolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03368.pdf)
> As an integral component of blind image deblurring, non-blind deconvolution removes image blur with a given blur kernel, which is essential but difficult due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. The predominant approach is based on optimization subject to regularization functions that are either manually designed, or learned from examples. Existing learning based methods have shown superior restoration quality but are not practical enough due to their restricted model design. They solely focus on learning a prior and require to know the noise level for deconvolution. We address the gap between the optimization-based and learning-based approaches by learning an optimizer. We propose a Recurrent Gradient Descent Network (RGDN) by systematically incorporating deep neural networks into a fully parameterized gradient descent scheme. A parameter-free update unit is used to generate updates from the current estimates, based on a convolutional neural network. By training on diverse examples, the Recurrent Gradient Descent Network learns an implicit image prior and a universal update rule through recursive supervision. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and challenging real-world images demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and robust to produce favorable results as well as practical for real-world image deblurring applications. 
### 227.Learning Pose Specific Representations by Predicting Different Views [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03390.pdf)
> The labeled data required to learn pose estimation for articulated objects is difficult to provide in the desired quantity, realism, density, and accuracy. To address this issue, we develop a method to learn representations, which are very specific for articulated poses, without the need for labeled training data. We exploit the observation that the object pose of a known object is predictive for the appearance in any known view. That is, given only the pose and shape parameters of a hand, the hand's appearance from any viewpoint can be approximated. To exploit this observation, we train a model that -- given input from one view -- estimates a latent representation, which is trained to be predictive for the appearance of the object when captured from another viewpoint. Thus, the only necessary supervision is the second view. The training process of this model reveals an implicit pose representation in the latent space. Importantly, at test time the pose representation can be inferred using only a single view. In qualitative and quantitative experiments we show that the learned representations capture detailed pose information. Moreover, when training the proposed method jointly with labeled and unlabeled data, it consistently surpasses the performance of its fully supervised counterpart, while reducing the amount of needed labeled samples by at least one order of magnitude. 
### 228.Roto-Translation Covariant Convolutional Networks for Medical Image  Analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03393.pdf)
> We propose a framework for rotation and translation covariant deep learning using $SE(2)$ group convolutions. The group product of the special Euclidean motion group $SE(2)$ describes how a concatenation of two roto-translations results in a net roto-translation. We encode this geometric structure into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) via $SE(2)$ group convolutional layers, which fit into the standard 2D CNN framework, and which allow to generically deal with rotated input samples without the need for data augmentation. <br />We introduce three layers: a lifting layer which lifts a 2D (vector valued) image to an $SE(2)$-image, i.e., 3D (vector valued) data whose domain is $SE(2)$; a group convolution layer from and to an $SE(2)$-image; and a projection layer from an $SE(2)$-image to a 2D image. The lifting and group convolution layers are $SE(2)$ covariant (the output roto-translates with the input). The final projection layer, a maximum intensity projection over rotations, makes the full CNN rotation invariant. <br />We show with three different problems in histopathology, retinal imaging, and electron microscopy that with the proposed group CNNs, state-of-the-art performance can be achieved, without the need for data augmentation by rotation and with increased performance compared to standard CNNs that do rely on augmentation. 
### 229.RSGAN: Face Swapping and Editing using Face and Hair Representation in  Latent Spaces [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03447.pdf)
> In this paper, we present an integrated system for automatically generating and editing face images through face swapping, attribute-based editing, and random face parts synthesis. The proposed system is based on a deep neural network that variationally learns the face and hair regions with large-scale face image datasets. Different from conventional variational methods, the proposed network represents the latent spaces individually for faces and hairs. We refer to the proposed network as region-separative generative adversarial network (RSGAN). The proposed network independently handles face and hair appearances in the latent spaces, and then, face swapping is achieved by replacing the latent-space representations of the faces, and reconstruct the entire face image with them. This approach in the latent space robustly performs face swapping even for images which the previous methods result in failure due to inappropriate fitting or the 3D morphable models. In addition, the proposed system can further edit face-swapped images with the same network by manipulating visual attributes or by composing them with randomly generated face or hair parts. 
### 230.Exploring Disentangled Feature Representation Beyond Face Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03487.pdf)
> This paper proposes learning disentangled but complementary face features with minimal supervision by face identification. Specifically, we construct an identity Distilling and Dispelling Autoencoder (D2AE) framework that adversarially learns the identity-distilled features for identity verification and the identity-dispelled features to fool the verification system. Thanks to the design of two-stream cues, the learned disentangled features represent not only the identity or attribute but the complete input image. Comprehensive evaluations further demonstrate that the proposed features not only maintain state-of-the-art identity verification performance on LFW, but also acquire competitive discriminative power for face attribute recognition on CelebA and LFWA. Moreover, the proposed system is ready to semantically control the face generation/editing based on various identities and attributes in an unsupervised manner. 
### 231.PointNetVLAD: Deep Point Cloud Based Retrieval for Large-Scale Place  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03492.pdf)
> Unlike its image based counterpart, point cloud based retrieval for place recognition has remained as an unexplored and unsolved problem. This is largely due to the difficulty in extracting local feature descriptors from a point cloud that can subsequently be encoded into a global descriptor for the retrieval task. In this paper, we propose the PointNetVLAD where we leverage on the recent success of deep networks to solve point cloud based retrieval for place recognition. Specifically, our PointNetVLAD is a combination/modification of the existing PointNet and NetVLAD, which allows end-to-end training and inference to extract the global descriptor from a given 3D point cloud. Furthermore, we propose the "lazy triplet and quadruplet" loss functions that can achieve more discriminative and generalizable global descriptors to tackle the retrieval task. We create benchmark datasets for point cloud based retrieval for place recognition, and the experimental results on these datasets show the feasibility of our PointNetVLAD. Our code and the link for the benchmark dataset downloads are available in our project website. <a href="http://github.com/mikacuy/pointnetvlad/">this http URL</a> 
### 232.The Monge-Kantorovich Optimal Transport Distance for Image Comparison [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03531.pdf)
> This paper focuses on the Monge-Kantorovich formulation of the optimal transport problem and the associated $L^2$ Wasserstein distance. We use the $L^2$ Wasserstein distance in the Nearest Neighbour (NN) machine learning architecture to demonstrate the potential power of the optimal transport distance for image comparison. We compare the Wasserstein distance to other established distances - including the partial differential equation (PDE) formulation of the optimal transport problem - and demonstrate that on the well known MNIST optical character recognition dataset, it achieves excellent results. 
### 233.A real-time and unsupervised face Re-Identification system for  Human-Robot Interaction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03547.pdf)
> In the context of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), face Re-Identification (face Re-ID) aims to verify if certain detected faces have already been observed by robots. The ability of distinguishing between different users is crucial in social robots as it will enable the robot to tailor the interaction strategy toward the users' individual preferences. So far face recognition research has achieved great success, however little attention has been paid to the realistic applications of Face Re-ID in social robots. In this paper, we present an effective and unsupervised face Re-ID system which simultaneously re-identifies multiple faces for HRI. This Re-ID system employs Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to extract features, and an online clustering algorithm to determine the face's ID. Its performance is evaluated on two datasets: the TERESA video dataset collected by the TERESA robot, and the YouTube Face Dataset (YTF Dataset). We demonstrate that the optimised combination of techniques achieves an overall 93.55% accuracy on TERESA dataset and an overall 90.41% accuracy on YTF dataset. We have implemented the proposed method into a software module in the HCI^2 Framework for it to be further integrated into the TERESA robot, and has achieved real-time performance at 10~26 Frames per second. 
### 234.Two Stream 3D Semantic Scene Completion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03550.pdf)
> Inferring the 3D geometry and the semantic meaning of surfaces, which are occluded, is a very challenging task. Recently, a first end-to-end learning approach has been proposed that completes a scene from a single depth image. The approach voxelizes the scene and predicts for each voxel if it is occupied and, if it is occupied, the semantic class label. In this work, we propose a two stream approach that leverages depth information and semantic information, which is inferred from the RGB image, for this task. The approach constructs an incomplete 3D semantic tensor, which uses a compact three-channel encoding for the inferred semantic information, and uses a 3D CNN to infer the complete 3D semantic tensor. In our experimental evaluation, we show that the proposed two stream approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art for semantic scene completion. 
### 235.Evaluation of the visual odometry methods for semi-dense real-time [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03558.pdf)
> Recent decades have witnessed a significant increase in the use of visual odometry(VO) in the computer vision area. It has also been used in varieties of robotic applications, for example on the Mars Exploration Rovers. This paper, firstly, discusses two popular existing visual odometry approaches, namely LSD-SLAM and ORB-SLAM2 to improve the performance metrics of visual SLAM systems using Umeyama Method. We carefully evaluate the methods referred to above on three different well-known KITTI datasets, EuRoC MAV dataset, and TUM RGB-D dataset to obtain the best results and graphically compare the results to evaluation metrics from different visual odometry approaches. Secondly, we propose an approach running in real-time with a stereo camera, which combines an existing feature-based (indirect) method and an existing feature-less (direct) method matching with accurate semidense direct image alignment and reconstructing an accurate 3D environment directly on pixels that have image gradient. Keywords VO, performance metrics, Umeyama Method, feature-based method, feature-less method &amp; semi-dense real-time. 
### 236.Large Field and High Resolution: Detecting Needle in Haystack [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03576.pdf)
> The growing use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for a broad range of visual tasks, including tasks involving fine details, raises the problem of applying such networks to a large field of view, since the amount of computations increases significantly with the number of pixels. To deal effectively with this difficulty, we develop and compare methods of using CNNs for the task of small target localization in natural images, given a limited "budget" of samples to form an image. Inspired in part by human vision, we develop and compare variable sampling schemes, with peak resolution at the center and decreasing resolution with eccentricity, applied iteratively by re-centering the image at the previous predicted target location. The results indicate that variable resolution models significantly outperform constant resolution models. Surprisingly, variable resolution models and in particular multi-channel models, outperform the optimal, "budget-free" full-resolution model, using only 5\% of the samples. 
### 237.Classification of Point Cloud Scenes with Multiscale Voxel Deep Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03583.pdf)
> In this article we describe a new convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify 3D point clouds of urban or indoor scenes. Solutions are given to the problems encountered working on scene point clouds, and a network is described that allows for point classification using only the position of points in a multi-scale neighborhood. <br />On the reduced-8 Semantic3D benchmark [Hackel et al., 2017], this network, ranked second, beats the state of the art of point classification methods (those not using a regularization step). 
### 238.Geometrical analysis of polynomial lens distortion models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03584.pdf)
> Polynomial functions are a usual choice to model the nonlinearity of lenses. Typically, these models are obtained through physical analysis of the lens system or on purely empirical grounds. The aim of this work is to facilitate an alternative approach to the selection or design of these models based on establishing a priori the desired geometrical properties of the distortion functions. With this purpose we obtain all the possible isotropic linear models and also those that are formed by functions with symmetry with respect to some axis. In this way, the classical models (decentering, thin prism distortion) are found to be particular instances of the family of models found by geometric considerations. These results allow to find generalizations of the most usually employed models while preserving the desired geometrical properties. Our results also provide a better understanding of the geometric properties of the models employed in the most usual computer vision software libraries. 
### 239.A Deep Information Sharing Network for Multi-contrast Compressed Sensing  MRI Reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03596.pdf)
> In multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compressed sensing theory can accelerate imaging by sampling fewer measurements within each contrast. The conventional optimization-based models suffer several limitations: strict assumption of shared sparse support, time-consuming optimization and "shallow" models with difficulties in encoding the rich patterns hiding in massive MRI data. In this paper, we propose the first deep learning model for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction. We achieve information sharing through feature sharing units, which significantly reduces the number of parameters. The feature sharing unit is combined with a data fidelity unit to comprise an inference block. These inference blocks are cascaded with dense connections, which allows for information transmission across different depths of the network efficiently. Our extensive experiments on various multi-contrast MRI datasets show that proposed model outperforms both state-of-the-art single-contrast and multi-contrast MRI methods in accuracy and efficiency. We show the improved reconstruction quality can bring great benefits for the later medical image analysis stage. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed model to the non-registration environment shows its potential in real MRI applications. 
### 240.Imagine This! Scripts to Compositions to Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03608.pdf)
> Imagining a scene described in natural language with realistic layout and appearance of entities is the ultimate test of spatial, visual, and semantic world knowledge. Towards this goal, we present the Composition, Retrieval, and Fusion Network (CRAFT), a model capable of learning this knowledge from video-caption data and applying it while generating videos from novel captions. CRAFT explicitly predicts a temporal-layout of mentioned entities (characters and objects), retrieves spatio-temporal entity segments from a video database and fuses them to generate scene videos. Our contributions include sequential training of components of CRAFT while jointly modeling layout and appearances, and losses that encourage learning compositional representations for retrieval. We evaluate CRAFT on semantic fidelity to caption, composition consistency, and visual quality. CRAFT outperforms direct pixel generation approaches and generalizes well to unseen captions and to unseen video databases with no text annotations. We demonstrate CRAFT on FLINTSTONES, a new richly annotated video-caption dataset with over 25000 videos. For a glimpse of videos generated by CRAFT, see <a href="https://youtu.be/688Vv86n0z8.">this https URL</a> 
### 241.Audio-Visual Scene Analysis with Self-Supervised Multisensory Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03641.pdf)
> The thud of a bouncing ball, the onset of speech as lips open -- when visual and audio events occur together, it suggests that there might be a common, underlying event that produced both signals. In this paper, we argue that the visual and audio components of a video signal should be modeled jointly using a fused multisensory representation. We propose to learn such a representation in a self-supervised way, by training a neural network to predict whether video frames and audio are temporally aligned. We use this learned representation for three applications: (a) sound source localization, i.e. visualizing the source of sound in a video; (b) audio-visual action recognition; and (c) on/off-screen audio source separation, e.g. removing the off-screen translator's voice from a foreign official's speech. Code, models, and video results are available on our webpage: <a href="http://andrewowens.com/multisensory">this http URL</a> 
### 242.Semi-supervised Adversarial Learning to Generate Photorealistic Face  Images of New Identities from 3D Morphable Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03675.pdf)
> We propose a novel end-to-end semi-supervised adversarial framework to generate photorealistic face images of new identities with wide ranges of expressions, poses, and illuminations conditioned by a 3D morphable model. Previous adversarial style-transfer methods either supervise their networks with large volume of paired data or use unpaired data with a highly under-constrained two-way generative framework in an unsupervised fashion. We introduce pairwise adversarial supervision to constrain two-way domain adaptation by a small number of paired real and synthetic images for training along with the large volume of unpaired data. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are performed to validate our idea. Generated face images of new identities contain pose, lighting and expression diversity and qualitative results show that they are highly constraint by the synthetic input image while adding photorealism and retaining identity information. We combine face images generated by the proposed method with the real data set to train face recognition algorithms. We evaluated the model on two challenging data sets: LFW and IJB-A. We observe that the generated images from our framework consistently improves over the performance of deep face recognition network trained with Oxford VGG Face dataset and achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art. 
### 243.French Word Recognition through a Quick Survey on Recurrent Neural  Networks Using Long-Short Term Memory RNN-LSTM [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03683.pdf)
> Optical character recognition (OCR) is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Research studies have shown significant progress in classifying printed characters using deep learning-based methods and topologies. Among current algorithms, recurrent neural networks with long-short term memory blocks called RNN-LSTM have provided the highest performance in terms of accuracy rate. Using the top 5,000 French words collected from the internet including all signs and accents, RNN-LSTM models were trained and tested for several cases. Six fonts were used to generate OCR samples and an additional dataset that included all samples from these six fonts was prepared for training and testing purposes. The trained RNN-LSTM models were tested and achieved the accuracy rates of 99.98798% and 99.91889% for edit distance and sequence error, respectively. An accurate preprocessing followed by height normalization (standardization methods in deep learning) enabled the RNN-LSTM model to be trained in the most efficient way. This machine learning work also revealed the robustness of RNN-LSTM topology to recognize printed characters. 
### 244.Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning with Categorical Generative  Adversarial Networks assisted by Wasserstein distance for dermoscopy image  Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03700.pdf)
> Melanoma is a curable aggressive skin cancer if detected early. Typically, the diagnosis involves initial screening with subsequent biopsy and histopathological examination if necessary. Computer aided diagnosis offers an objective score that is independent of clinical experience and the potential to lower the workload of a dermatologist. In the recent past, success of deep learning algorithms in the field of general computer vision has motivated successful application of supervised deep learning methods in computer aided melanoma recognition. However, large quantities of labeled images are required to make further improvements on the supervised method. A good annotation generally requires clinical and histological confirmation, which requires significant effort. In an attempt to alleviate this constraint, we propose to use categorical generative adversarial network to automatically learn the feature representation of dermoscopy images in an unsupervised and semi-supervised manner. Thorough experiments on ISIC 2016 skin lesion chal- lenge demonstrate that the proposed feature learning method has achieved an average precision score of 0.424 with only 140 labeled images. Moreover, the proposed method is also capable of generating real-world like dermoscopy images. 
### 245.Graph Matching with Anchor Nodes: A Learning Approach [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03715.pdf)
> In this paper, we consider the weighted graph matching problem with partially disclosed correspondences between a number of anchor nodes. Our construction exploits recently introduced node signatures based on graph Laplacians, namely the Laplacian family signature (LFS) on the nodes, and the pairwise heat kernel map on the edges. In this paper, without assuming an explicit form of parametric dependence nor a distance metric between node signatures, we formulate an optimization problem which incorporates the knowledge of anchor nodes. Solving this problem gives us an optimized proximity measure specific to the graphs under consideration. Using this as a first order compatibility term, we then set up an integer quadratic program (IQP) to solve for a near optimal graph matching. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on randomly generated graphs and on two widely-used image sequences, when compared with other existing signature and adjacency matrix based graph matching methods. 
### 246.Nonlinear 3D Face Morphable Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03786.pdf)
> As a classic statistical model of 3D facial shape and texture, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is widely used in facial analysis, e.g., model fitting, image synthesis. Conventional 3DMM is learned from a set of well-controlled 2D face images with associated 3D face scans, and represented by two sets of PCA basis functions. Due to the type and amount of training data, as well as the linear bases, the representation power of 3DMM can be limited. To address these problems, this paper proposes an innovative framework to learn a nonlinear 3DMM model from a large set of unconstrained face images, without collecting 3D face scans. Specifically, given a face image as input, a network encoder estimates the projection, shape and texture parameters. Two decoders serve as the nonlinear 3DMM to map from the shape and texture parameters to the 3D shape and texture, respectively. With the projection parameter, 3D shape, and texture, a novel analytically-differentiable rendering layer is designed to reconstruct the original input face. The entire network is end-to-end trainable with only weak supervision. We demonstrate the superior representation power of our nonlinear 3DMM over its linear counterpart, and its contribution to face alignment and 3D reconstruction. 
### 247.Multi-Scale Generalized Plane Match for Optical Flow [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03787.pdf)
> Despite recent advances, estimating optical flow remains a challenging problem in the presence of illumination change, large occlusions or fast movement. In this paper, we propose a novel optical flow estimation framework which can provide accurate dense correspondence and occlusion localization through a multi-scale generalized plane matching approach. In our method, we regard the scene as a collection of planes at multiple scales, and for each such plane, compensate motion in consensus to improve match quality. We estimate the square patch plane distortion using a robust plane model detection method and iteratively apply a plane matching scheme within a multi-scale framework. During the flow estimation process, our enhanced plane matching method also clearly localizes the occluded regions. In experiments on MPI-Sintel datasets, our method robustly estimated optical flow from given noisy correspondences, and also revealed the occluded regions accurately. Compared to other state-of-the-art optical flow methods, our method shows accurate occlusion localization, comparable optical flow quality, and better thin object detection. 
### 248.Decoupled Novel Object Captioner [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03803.pdf)
> Image captioning is a challenging task where the machine automatically describes an image by sentences or phrases. It often requires a large number of paired image-sentence annotations for training. However, a pre-trained captioning model can hardly be applied to a new domain in which some novel object categories exist, i.e., the objects and their description words are unseen during model training. To correctly caption the novel object, it requires professional human workers to annotate the images by sentences with the novel words. It is labor expensive and thus limits its usage in real-world applications. <br />In this paper, we introduce the zero-shot novel object captioning task where the machine generates descriptions without extra sentences about the novel object. To tackle the challenging problem, we propose a Decoupled Novel Object Captioner (DNOC) framework that can fully decouple the language sequence model from the object descriptions. DNOC has two components. 1) A Sequence Model with the Placeholder (SM-P) generates a sentence containing placeholders. The placeholder represents an unseen novel object. Thus, the sequence model can be decoupled from the novel object descriptions. 2) A key-value object memory built upon the freely available detection model, contains the visual information and the corresponding word for each object. The SM-P will generate a query to retrieve the words from the object memory. The placeholder will then be filled with the correct word, resulting in a caption with novel object descriptions. The experimental results on the held-out MSCOCO dataset demonstrate the ability of DNOC in describing novel concepts in the zero-shot novel object captioning task. 
### 249.ExFuse: Enhancing Feature Fusion for Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03821.pdf)
> Modern semantic segmentation frameworks usually combine low-level and high-level features from pre-trained backbone convolutional models to boost performance. In this paper, we first point out that a simple fusion of low-level and high-level features could be less effective because of the gap in semantic levels and spatial resolution. We find that introducing semantic information into low-level features and high-resolution details into high-level features is more effective for the later fusion. Based on this observation, we propose a new framework, named ExFuse, to bridge the gap between low-level and high-level features thus significantly improve the segmentation quality by 4.0\% in total. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark and achieve 87.9\% mean IoU, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art results. 
### 250.Unsupervised Pathology Image Segmentation Using Representation Learning  with Spherical K-means [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03828.pdf)
> This paper presents a novel method for unsupervised segmentation of pathology images. Staging of lung cancer is a major factor of prognosis. Measuring the maximum dimensions of the invasive component in a pathology images is an essential task. Therefore, image segmentation methods for visualizing the extent of invasive and noninvasive components on pathology images could support pathological examination. However, it is challenging for most of the recent segmentation methods that rely on supervised learning to cope with unlabeled pathology images. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to unsupervised representation learning and clustering for pathology image segmentation. Our method consists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn feature representations of training patches from a target image using the spherical k-means. The purpose of this phase is to obtain cluster centroids which could be used as filters for feature extraction. In the second phase, we apply conventional k-means to the representations extracted by the centroids and then project cluster labels to the target images. We evaluated our methods on pathology images of lung cancer specimen. Our experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms traditional k-means segmentation and the multithreshold Otsu method both quantitatively and qualitatively with an improved normalized mutual information (NMI) score of 0.626 compared to 0.168 and 0.167, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the centroids can be applied to the segmentation of other slices from the same sample. 
### 251.Unsupervised Segmentation of 3D Medical Images Based on Clustering and  Deep Representation Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03830.pdf)
> This paper presents a novel unsupervised segmentation method for 3D medical images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought significant advances in image segmentation. However, most of the recent methods rely on supervised learning, which requires large amounts of manually annotated data. Thus, it is challenging for these methods to cope with the growing amount of medical images. This paper proposes a unified approach to unsupervised deep representation learning and clustering for segmentation. Our proposed method consists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn deep feature representations of training patches from a target image using joint unsupervised learning (JULE) that alternately clusters representations generated by a CNN and updates the CNN parameters using cluster labels as supervisory signals. We extend JULE to 3D medical images by utilizing 3D convolutions throughout the CNN architecture. In the second phase, we apply k-means to the deep representations from the trained CNN and then project cluster labels to the target image in order to obtain the fully segmented image. We evaluated our methods on three images of lung cancer specimens scanned with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The automatic segmentation of pathological regions in micro-CT could further contribute to the pathological examination process. Hence, we aim to automatically divide each image into the regions of invasive carcinoma, noninvasive carcinoma, and normal tissue. Our experiments show the potential abilities of unsupervised deep representation learning for medical image segmentation. 
### 252.Real-world plant species identification based on deep convolutional  neural networks and visual attention [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03853.pdf)
> This paper investigates the issue of real-world identification to fulfill better species protection. We focus on plant species identification as it is a classic and hot issue. In tradition plant species identification the samples are scanned specimen and the background is simple. However, real-world species recognition is more challenging. We first systematically investigate what is realistic species recognition and the difference from tradition plant species recognition. To deal with the challenging task, an interdisciplinary collaboration is presented based on the latest advances in computer science and technology. We propose a novel framework and an effective data augmentation method for deep learning in this paper. We first crop the image in terms with visual attention before general recognition. Besides, we apply it as a data augmentation method. We call the novel data augmentation approach attention cropping (AC). Deep convolutional neural networks are trained to predict species from a large amount of data. Extensive experiments on traditional dataset and specific dataset for real-world recognition are conducted to evaluate the performance of our approach. Experiments first demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on different types of datasets. Besides, we also evaluate the performance of data augmentation method AC. Results show that AC provides superior performance. Compared with the precision of methods without AC, the results with AC achieve substantial improvement. 
### 253.MaskReID: A Mask Based Deep Ranking Neural Network for Person  Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03864.pdf)
> In this paper, a novel mask based deep ranking neural network with skipped fusing layer (MaskReID) is proposed for person re-identification (Re-ID). For person Re-ID, there are multiple challenges co-exist throughout the re-identification process, including cluttered background, appearance variations (illumination, pose, occlusion, etc.) among different camera views and interference of samples of similar appearance. A compact framework is proposed to address these problems. Firstly, to address the problem of cluttered background, masked images which are the image segmentations of the original images are incorporated as input in the proposed neural network. Then, to remove the appearance variations so as to obtain more discriminative feature, a new network structure is proposed which fuses feature of different layers as the final feature. This makes the final feature a combination of all the low, middle and high level feature, which is more informative. Lastly, as person Re-ID is a special image retrieval task, a novel ranking loss is designed to optimize the whole network. The ranking loss relieved the interference problem of similar samples while producing ranking results. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on many person Re-ID datasets, especially large-scale datasets, such as, CUHK03, Market1501 and DukeMTMC-reID. 
### 254.Hybrid Binary Networks: Optimizing for Accuracy, Efficiency and Memory [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03867.pdf)
> Binarization is an extreme network compression approach that provides large computational speedups along with energy and memory savings, albeit at significant accuracy costs. We investigate the question of where to binarize inputs at layer-level granularity and show that selectively binarizing the inputs to specific layers in the network could lead to significant improvements in accuracy while preserving most of the advantages of binarization. We analyze the binarization tradeoff using a metric that jointly models the input binarization-error and computational cost and introduce an efficient algorithm to select layers whose inputs are to be binarized. Practical guidelines based on insights obtained from applying the algorithm to a variety of models are discussed. Experiments on Imagenet dataset using AlexNet and ResNet-18 models show 3-4% improvements in accuracy over fully binarized networks with minimal impact on compression and computational speed. The improvements are even more substantial on sketch datasets like TU-Berlin, where we match state-of-the-art accuracy as well, getting over 8% increase in accuracies. We further show that our approach can be applied in tandem with other forms of compression that deal with individual layers or overall model compression (e.g., SqueezeNets). Unlike previous quantization approaches, we are able to binarize the weights in the last layers of a network, which often have a large number of parameters, resulting in significant improvement in accuracy over fully binarized models. 
### 255.Plaque Classification in Coronary Arteries from IVOCT Images Using  Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03904.pdf)
> Advanced atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide while being preventable and treatable. In order to image atherosclerotic lesions (plaque), intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) can be used. The technique provides high-resolution images of arterial walls which allows for early plaque detection by experts. Due to the vast amount of IVOCT images acquired in clinical routines, automatic plaque detection has been addressed. For example, attenuation profiles in single A-Scans of IVOCT images are examined to detect plaque. We address automatic plaque classification from entire IVOCT images, the cross-sectional view of the artery, using deep feature learning. In this way, we take context between A-Scans into account and we directly learn relevant features from the image source without the need for handcrafting features. 
### 256.Fusing Saliency Maps with Region Proposals for Unsupervised Object  Localization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03905.pdf)
> In this paper we address the problem of unsupervised localization of objects in single images. Compared to previous state-of-the-art method our method is fully unsupervised in the sense that there is no prior instance level or category level information about the image. Furthermore, we treat each image individually and do not rely on any neighboring image similarity. We employ deep-learning based generation of saliency maps and region proposals to tackle this problem. First salient regions in the image are determined using an encoder/decoder architecture. The resulting saliency map is matched with region proposals from a class agnostic region proposal network to roughly localize the candidate object regions. These regions are further refined based on the overlap and similarity ratios. Our experimental evaluations on a benchmark dataset show that the method gets close to current state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization accuracy even though these make use of multiple frames. Furthermore, we created a more challenging and realistic dataset with multiple object categories and varying viewpoint and illumination conditions for evaluating the method's performance in real world scenarios. 
### 257.Deep Learning For Computer Vision Tasks: A review [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03928.pdf)
> Deep learning has recently become one of the most popular sub-fields of machine learning owing to its distributed data representation with multiple levels of abstraction. A diverse range of deep learning algorithms are being employed to solve conventional artificial intelligence problems. This paper gives an overview of some of the most widely used deep learning algorithms applied in the field of computer vision. It first inspects the various approaches of deep learning algorithms, followed by a description of their applications in image classification, object identification, image extraction and semantic segmentation in the presence of noise. The paper concludes with the discussion of the future scope and challenges for construction and training of deep neural networks. 
### 258.Offline Object Extraction from Dynamic Occupancy Grid Map Sequences [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03933.pdf)
> A dynamic occupancy grid map (DOGMa) allows a fast, robust, and complete environment representation for automated vehicles. Dynamic objects in a DOGMa, however, are commonly represented as independent cells while modeled objects with shape and pose are favorable. The evaluation of algorithms for object extraction or the training and validation of learning algorithms rely on labeled ground truth data. Manually annotating objects in a DOGMa to obtain ground truth data is a time consuming and expensive process. Additionally the quality of labeled data depend strongly on the variation of filtered input data. The presented work introduces an automatic labeling process, where a full sequence is used to extract the best possible object pose and shape in terms of temporal consistency. A two direction temporal search is executed to trace single objects over a sequence, where the best estimate of its extent and pose is refined in every time step. Furthermore, the presented algorithm only uses statistical constraints of the cell clusters for the object extraction instead of fixed heuristic parameters. Experimental results show a well-performing automatic labeling algorithm with real sensor data even at challenging scenarios. 
### 259.Measurement of exceptional motion in VR video contents for VR sickness  assessment using deep convolutional autoencoder [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03939.pdf)
> This paper proposes a new objective metric of exceptional motion in VR video contents for VR sickness assessment. In VR environment, VR sickness can be caused by several factors which are mismatched motion, field of view, motion parallax, viewing angle, etc. Similar to motion sickness, VR sickness can induce a lot of physical symptoms such as general discomfort, headache, stomach awareness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and disorientation. To address the viewing safety issues in virtual environment, it is of great importance to develop an objective VR sickness assessment method that predicts and analyses the degree of VR sickness induced by the VR content. The proposed method takes into account motion information that is one of the most important factors in determining the overall degree of VR sickness. In this paper, we detect the exceptional motion that is likely to induce VR sickness. Spatio-temporal features of the exceptional motion in the VR video content are encoded using a convolutional autoencoder. For objectively assessing the VR sickness, the level of exceptional motion in VR video content is measured by using the convolutional autoencoder as well. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been successfully evaluated by subjective assessment experiment using simulator sickness questionnaires (SSQ) in VR environment. 
### 260.VR IQA NET: Deep Virtual Reality Image Quality Assessment using  Adversarial Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03943.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel virtual reality image quality assessment (VR IQA) with adversarial learning for omnidirectional images. To take into account the characteristics of the omnidirectional image, we devise deep networks including novel quality score predictor and human perception guider. The proposed quality score predictor automatically predicts the quality score of distorted image using the latent spatial and position feature. The proposed human perception guider criticizes the predicted quality score of the predictor with the human perceptual score using adversarial learning. For evaluation, we conducted extensive subjective experiments with omnidirectional image dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed VR IQA metric outperforms the 2-D IQA and the state-of-the-arts VR IQA. 
### 261.Projection image-to-image translation in hybrid X-ray/MR imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03955.pdf)
> The potential benefit of hybrid X-ray and MR imaging in the interventional environment is enormous. However, a vast amount of existing image enhancement methods requires the image information to be present in the same domain. To unlock this potential, we present a solution to image-to-image translation from MR projections to corresponding X-ray projection images. The approach is based on a state-of-the-art image generator network that is modified to fit the specific application. Furthermore, we propose the inclusion of a gradient map to the perceptual loss to emphasize high frequency details. The proposed approach is capable of creating X-ray projection images with natural appearance. Additionally, our extensions show clear improvement compared to the baseline method. 
### 262.Making Deep Heatmaps Robust to Partial Occlusions for 3D Object Pose  Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03959.pdf)
> We introduce a novel method for robust and accurate 3D object pose estimation from a single color image under large occlusions. Following recent approaches, we first predict the 2D projections of 3D points related to the target object and then compute the 3D pose from these correspondences using a geometric method. Unfortunately, as the results of our experiments show, predicting these 2D projections using a regular CNN or a Convolutional Pose Machine is highly sensitive to partial occlusions, even when these methods are trained with partially occluded examples. Our solution is to predict heatmaps from multiple small patches independently and to accumulate the results to obtain accurate and robust predictions. Training subsequently becomes challenging because patches with similar appearances but different positions on the object correspond to different heatmaps. However, we provide a simple yet effective solution to deal with such ambiguities. We show that our approach outperforms existing methods on two challenging datasets: The Occluded LineMOD dataset and the YCB-Video dataset, both exhibiting cluttered scenes with highly occluded objects.

### 263.Attention U-Net: Learning Where to Look for the Pancreas [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03999.pdf)
> We propose a novel attention gate (AG) model for medical imaging that automatically learns to focus on target structures of varying shapes and sizes. Models trained with AGs implicitly learn to suppress irrelevant regions in an input image while highlighting salient features useful for a specific task. This enables us to eliminate the necessity of using explicit external tissue/organ localisation modules of cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs). AGs can be easily integrated into standard CNN architectures such as the U-Net model with minimal computational overhead while increasing the model sensitivity and prediction accuracy. The proposed Attention U-Net architecture is evaluated on two large CT abdominal datasets for multi-class image segmentation. Experimental results show that AGs consistently improve the prediction performance of U-Net across different datasets and training sizes while preserving computational efficiency. The code for the proposed architecture is publicly available. 
### 264.Dynamic Multi-Scale Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images based on  Convolutional Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04020.pdf)
> Semantic segmentation requires methods capable of learning high-level features while dealing with large volume of data. Towards such goal, Convolutional Networks can learn specific and adaptable features based on the data. However, these networks are not capable of processing a whole remote sensing image, given its huge size. To overcome such limitation, the image is processed using fixed size patches. The definition of the input patch size is usually performed empirically (evaluating several sizes) or imposed (by network constraint). Both strategies suffer from drawbacks and could not lead to the best patch size. To alleviate this problem, several works exploited multi-scale information by combining networks or layers. This process increases the number of parameters resulting in a more difficult model to train. In this work, we propose a novel technique to perform semantic segmentation of remote sensing images that exploits a multi-scale paradigm without increasing the number of parameters while defining, in training time, the best patch size. The main idea is to train a dilated network with distinct patch sizes, allowing it to capture multi-scale characteristics from heterogeneous contexts. While processing these varying patches, the network provides a score for each patch size, helping in the definition of the best size for the current scenario. A systematic evaluation of the proposed algorithm is conducted using four high-resolution remote sensing datasets with very distinct properties. Our results show that the proposed algorithm provides improvements in pixelwise classification accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art methods. 
### 265.Learning to Extract a Video Sequence from a Single Motion-Blurred Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04065.pdf)
> We present a method to extract a video sequence from a single motion-blurred image. Motion-blurred images are the result of an averaging process, where instant frames are accumulated over time during the exposure of the sensor. Unfortunately, reversing this process is nontrivial. Firstly, averaging destroys the temporal ordering of the frames. Secondly, the recovery of a single frame is a blind deconvolution task, which is highly ill-posed. We present a deep learning scheme that gradually reconstructs a temporal ordering by sequentially extracting pairs of frames. Our main contribution is to introduce loss functions invariant to the temporal order. This lets a neural network choose during training what frame to output among the possible combinations. We also address the ill-posedness of deblurring by designing a network with a large receptive field and implemented via resampling to achieve a higher computational efficiency. Our proposed method can successfully retrieve sharp image sequences from a single motion blurred image and can generalize well on synthetic and real datasets captured with different cameras. 
### 266.Seed-Point Detection of Clumped Convex Objects by Short-Range Attractive  Long-Range Repulsive Particle Clustering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04071.pdf)
> Locating the center of convex objects is important in both image processing and unsupervised machine learning/data clustering fields. The automated analysis of biological images uses both of these fields for locating cell nuclei and for discovering new biological effects or cell phenotypes. In this work, we develop a novel clustering method for locating the centers of overlapping convex objects by modeling particles that interact by a short-range attractive and long-range repulsive potential and are confined to a potential well created from the data. We apply this method to locating the centers of clumped nuclei in cultured cells, where we show that it results in a significant improvement over existing methods (8.2% in F$_1$ score); and we apply it to unsupervised learning on a difficult data set that has rare classes without local density maxima, and show it is able to well locate cluster centers when other clustering techniques fail. 
### 267.Detail-Preserving Pooling in Deep Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04076.pdf)
> Most convolutional neural networks use some method for gradually downscaling the size of the hidden layers. This is commonly referred to as pooling, and is applied to reduce the number of parameters, improve invariance to certain distortions, and increase the receptive field size. Since pooling by nature is a lossy process, it is crucial that each such layer maintains the portion of the activations that is most important for the network's discriminability. Yet, simple maximization or averaging over blocks, max or average pooling, or plain downsampling in the form of strided convolutions are the standard. In this paper, we aim to leverage recent results on image downscaling for the purposes of deep learning. Inspired by the human visual system, which focuses on local spatial changes, we propose detail-preserving pooling (DPP), an adaptive pooling method that magnifies spatial changes and preserves important structural detail. Importantly, its parameters can be learned jointly with the rest of the network. We analyze some of its theoretical properties and show its empirical benefits on several datasets and networks, where DPP consistently outperforms previous pooling approaches. 
### 268.Ranking CGANs: Subjective Control over Semantic Image Attributes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04082.pdf)
> In this paper, we investigate the use of generative adversarial networks in the task of image generation according to subjective measures of semantic attributes. Unlike the standard (CGAN) that generates images from discrete categorical labels, our architecture handles both continuous and discrete scales. Given pairwise comparisons of images, our model, called RankCGAN, performs two tasks: it learns to rank images using a subjective measure; and it learns a generative model that can be controlled by that measure. RankCGAN associates each subjective measure of interest to a distinct dimension of some latent space. We perform experiments on UT-Zap50K, PubFig and OSR datasets and demonstrate that the model is expressive and diverse enough to conduct two-attribute exploration and image editing. 
### 269.The Conversation: Deep Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04121.pdf)
> Our goal is to isolate individual speakers from multi-talker simultaneous speech in videos. Existing works in this area have focussed on trying to separate utterances from known speakers in controlled environments. In this paper, we propose a deep audio-visual speech enhancement network that is able to separate a speaker's voice given lip regions in the corresponding video, by predicting both the magnitude and the phase of the target signal. The method is applicable to speakers unheard and unseen during training, and for unconstrained environments. We demonstrate strong quantitative and qualitative results, isolating extremely challenging real-world examples. 
### 270.Coloring with Words: Guiding Image Colorization Through Text-based  Palette Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04128.pdf)
> This paper proposes a novel approach to generate multiple color palettes that reflect the semantics of input text and then colorize a given grayscale image according to the generated color palette. In contrast to existing approaches, our model can understand rich text, whether it is a single word, a phrase, or a sentence, and generate multiple possible palettes from it. For this task, we introduce our manually curated dataset called Palette-and-Text (PAT). Our proposed model called Text2Colors consists of two conditional generative adversarial networks: the text-to-palette generation networks and the palette-based colorization networks. The former captures the semantics of the text input and produce relevant color palettes. The latter colorizes a grayscale image using the generated color palette. Our evaluation results show that people preferred our generated palettes over ground truth palettes and that our model can effectively reflect the given palette when colorizing an image. 
### 271.Deep Differential Recurrent Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04192.pdf)
> Due to the special gating schemes of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), LSTMs have shown greater potential to process complex sequential information than the traditional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The conventional LSTM, however, fails to take into consideration the impact of salient spatio-temporal dynamics present in the sequential input data. This problem was first addressed by the differential Recurrent Neural Network (dRNN), which uses a differential gating scheme known as Derivative of States (DoS). DoS uses higher orders of internal state derivatives to analyze the change in information gain caused by the salient motions between the successive frames. The weighted combination of several orders of DoS is then used to modulate the gates in dRNN. While each individual order of DoS is good at modeling a certain level of salient spatio-temporal sequences, the sum of all the orders of DoS could distort the detected motion patterns. To address this problem, we propose to control the LSTM gates via individual orders of DoS and stack multiple levels of LSTM cells in an increasing order of state derivatives. The proposed model progressively builds up the ability of the LSTM gates to detect salient dynamical patterns in deeper stacked layers modeling higher orders of DoS, and thus the proposed LSTM model is termed deep differential Recurrent Neural Network (d2RNN). The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on two publicly available human activity datasets: NUS-HGA and Violent-Flows. The proposed model outperforms both LSTM and non-LSTM based state-of-the-art algorithms. 
### 272.Multi-scale Neural Networks for Retinal Blood Vessels Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04206.pdf)
> Existing supervised approaches didn't make use of the low-level features which are actually effective to this task. And another deficiency is that they didn't consider the relation between pixels, which means effective features are not extracted. In this paper, we proposed a novel convolutional neural network which make sufficient use of low-level features together with high-level features and involves atrous convolution to get multi-scale features which should be considered as effective features. Our model is tested on three standard benchmarks - DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE databases. The results presents that our model significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, the area under the ROC curve and the highest prediction speed. Our work provides evidence of the power of wide and deep neural networks in retinal blood vessels segmentation task which could be applied on other medical images tasks. 
### 273.View Extrapolation of Human Body from a Single Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04213.pdf)
> We study how to synthesize novel views of human body from a single image. Though recent deep learning based methods work well for rigid objects, they often fail on objects with large articulation, like human bodies. The core step of existing methods is to fit a map from the observable views to novel views by CNNs; however, the rich articulation modes of human body make it rather challenging for CNNs to memorize and interpolate the data well. To address the problem, we propose a novel deep learning based pipeline that explicitly estimates and leverages the geometry of the underlying human body. Our new pipeline is a composition of a shape estimation network and an image generation network, and at the interface a perspective transformation is applied to generate a forward flow for pixel value transportation. Our design is able to factor out the space of data variation and makes learning at each step much easier. Empirically, we show that the performance for pose-varying objects can be improved dramatically. Our method can also be applied on real data captured by 3D sensors, and the flow generated by our methods can be used for generating high quality results in higher resolution. 
### 274.Learning Rigidity in Dynamic Scenes with a Moving Camera for 3D Motion  Field Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04259.pdf)
> Estimation of 3D motion in a dynamic scene from a temporal pair of images is a core task in many scene understanding problems. In real world applications, a dynamic scene is commonly captured by a moving camera (i.e., panning, tilting or hand-held), increasing the task complexity because the scene is observed from different view points. The main challenge is the disambiguation of the camera motion from scene motion, which becomes more difficult as the amount of rigidity observed decreases, even with successful estimation of 2D image correspondences. Compared to other state-of-the-art 3D scene flow estimation methods, in this paper we propose to \emph{learn} the rigidity of a scene in a supervised manner from a large collection of dynamic scene data, and directly infer a rigidity mask from two sequential images with depths. With the learned network, we show how we can effectively estimate camera motion and projected scene flow using computed 2D optical flow and the inferred rigidity mask. For training and testing the rigidity network, we also provide a new semi-synthetic dynamic scene dataset (synthetic foreground objects with a real background) and an evaluation split that accounts for the percentage of observed non-rigid pixels. Through our evaluation we show the proposed framework outperforms current state-of-the-art scene flow estimation methods in challenging dynamic scenes. 
### 275.VITAL: VIsual Tracking via Adversarial Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04273.pdf)
> The tracking-by-detection framework consists of two stages, i.e., drawing samples around the target object in the first stage and classifying each sample as the target object or as background in the second stage. The performance of existing trackers using deep classification networks is limited by two aspects. First, the positive samples in each frame are highly spatially overlapped, and they fail to capture rich appearance variations. Second, there exists extreme class imbalance between positive and negative samples. This paper presents the VITAL algorithm to address these two problems via adversarial learning. To augment positive samples, we use a generative network to randomly generate masks, which are applied to adaptively dropout input features to capture a variety of appearance changes. With the use of adversarial learning, our network identifies the mask that maintains the most robust features of the target objects over a long temporal span. In addition, to handle the issue of class imbalance, we propose a high-order cost sensitive loss to decrease the effect of easy negative samples to facilitate training the classification network. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 276.Clustering via Boundary Erosion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04312.pdf)
> Clustering analysis identifies samples as groups based on either their mutual closeness or homogeneity. In order to detect clusters in arbitrary shapes, a novel and generic solution based on boundary erosion is proposed. The clusters are assumed to be separated by relatively sparse regions. The samples are eroded sequentially according to their dynamic boundary densities. The erosion starts from low density regions, invading inwards, until all the samples are eroded out. By this manner, boundaries between different clusters become more and more apparent. It therefore offers a natural and powerful way to separate the clusters when the boundaries between them are hard to be drawn at once. With the sequential order of being eroded, the sequential boundary levels are produced, following which the clusters in arbitrary shapes are automatically reconstructed. As demonstrated across various clustering tasks, it is able to outperform most of the state-of-the-art algorithms and its performance is nearly perfect in some scenarios. 
### 277.A Large-scale Attribute Dataset for Zero-shot Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04314.pdf)
> Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) has attracted huge research attention over the past few years; it aims to learn the new concepts that have never been seen before. In classical ZSL algorithms, attributes are introduced as the intermediate semantic representation to realize the knowledge transfer from seen classes to unseen classes. Previous ZSL algorithms are tested on several benchmark datasets annotated with attributes. However, these datasets are defective in terms of the image distribution and attribute diversity. In addition, we argue that the "co-occurrence bias problem" of existing datasets, which is caused by the biased co-occurrence of objects, significantly hinders models from correctly learning the concept. To overcome these problems, we propose a Large-scale Attribute Dataset (LAD). Our dataset has 78,017 images of 5 super-classes, 230 classes. The image number of LAD is larger than the sum of the four most popular attribute datasets. 359 attributes of visual, semantic and subjective properties are defined and annotated in instance-level. We analyze our dataset by conducting both supervised learning and zero-shot learning tasks. Seven state-of-the-art ZSL algorithms are tested on this new dataset. The experimental results reveal the challenge of implementing zero-shot learning on our dataset. 
### 278.Cross-Modal Retrieval with Implicit Concept Association [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04318.pdf)
> Traditional cross-modal retrieval assumes explicit association of concepts across modalities, where there is no ambiguity in how the concepts are linked to each other, e.g., when we do the image search with a query "dogs", we expect to see dog images. In this paper, we consider a different setting for cross-modal retrieval where data from different modalities are implicitly linked via concepts that must be inferred by high-level reasoning; we call this setting implicit concept association. To foster future research in this setting, we present a new dataset containing 47K pairs of animated GIFs and sentences crawled from the web, in which the GIFs depict physical or emotional reactions to the scenarios described in the text (called "reaction GIFs"). We report on a user study showing that, despite the presence of implicit concept association, humans are able to identify video-sentence pairs with matching concepts, suggesting the feasibility of our task. Furthermore, we propose a novel visual-semantic embedding network based on multiple instance learning. Unlike traditional approaches, we compute multiple embeddings from each modality, each representing different concepts, and measure their similarity by considering all possible combinations of visual-semantic embeddings in the framework of multiple instance learning. We evaluate our approach on two video-sentence datasets with explicit and implicit concept association and report competitive results compared to existing approaches on cross-modal retrieval. 
### 279.STAIR Actions: A Video Dataset of Everyday Home Actions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04326.pdf)
> A new large-scale video dataset for human action recognition, called STAIR Actions is introduced. STAIR Actions contains 100 categories of action labels representing fine-grained everyday home actions so that it can be applied to research in various home tasks such as nursing, caring, and security. In STAIR Actions, each video has a single action label. Moreover, for each action category, there are around 1,000 videos that were obtained from YouTube or produced by crowdsource workers. The duration of each video is mostly five to six seconds. The total number of videos is 102,462. We explain how we constructed STAIR Actions and show the characteristics of STAIR Actions compared to existing datasets for human action recognition. Experiments with three major models for action recognition show that STAIR Actions can train large models and achieve good performance. STAIR Actions can be downloaded from <a href="http://actions.stair.center">this http URL</a> 
### 280.MelanoGANs: High Resolution Skin Lesion Synthesis with GANs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04338.pdf)
> Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully used to synthesize realistically looking images of faces, scenery and even medical images. Unfortunately, they usually require large training datasets, which are often scarce in the medical field, and to the best of our knowledge GANs have been only applied for medical image synthesis at fairly low resolution. However, many state-of-the-art machine learning models operate on high resolution data as such data carries indispensable, valuable information. In this work, we try to generate realistically looking high resolution images of skin lesions with GANs, using only a small training dataset of 2000 samples. The nature of the data allows us to do a direct comparison between the image statistics of the generated samples and the real dataset. We both quantitatively and qualitatively compare state-of-the-art GAN architectures such as DCGAN and LAPGAN against a modification of the latter for the task of image generation at a resolution of 256x256px. Our investigation shows that we can approximate the real data distribution with all of the models, but we notice major differences when visually rating sample realism, diversity and artifacts. In a set of use-case experiments on skin lesion classification, we further show that we can successfully tackle the problem of heavy class imbalance with the help of synthesized high resolution melanoma samples. 
### 281.Benchmark data and method for real-time people counting in cluttered  scenes using depth sensors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04339.pdf)
> Real-time automatic counting of people has widespread applications in security, safety and logistics.However, there is currently no large-scale public dataset for benchmarking approaches on this problem. To fill this gap, we introduce the first real-world RGB-D People Counting DataSet (PCDS) containing over 4,500 videos recorded at the entrance doors of buses in normal and cluttered conditions. We also propose an efficient method for counting people in real-world cluttered scenes using depth videos alone. The proposed method computes a point cloud from the depth video frame and re-projects it onto the ground plane to normalize the depth information. The resulting depth image is analyzed for identifying potential human heads. The human head proposals are meticulously refined using a 3D human model. The proposals in each frame of the continuous video stream are tracked to trace their trajectories. The trajectories are again refined to ascertain reliable counting. People are eventually counted by accumulating the head trajectories leaving the scene. To enable effective head and trajectory identification, we also propose two different compound features. Thorough evaluation on the PCDS demonstrates that our overall technique is able to count people in cluttered scenes with high accuracy at 45 fps on a 1.7 GHz processor. 
### 282.Zero-Shot Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04340.pdf)
> We introduce and tackle the problem of zero-shot object detection (ZSD), which aims to detect object classes which are not observed during training. We work with a challenging set of object classes, not restricting ourselves to similar and/or fine-grained categories as in prior works on zero-shot classification. We present a principled approach by first adapting visual-semantic embeddings for ZSD. We then discuss the problems associated with selecting a background class and motivate two background-aware approaches for learning robust detectors. One of these models uses a fixed background class and the other is based on iterative latent assignments. We also outline the challenge associated with using a limited number of training classes and propose a solution based on dense sampling of the semantic label space using auxiliary data with a large number of categories. We propose novel splits of two standard detection datasets - MSCOCO and VisualGenome, and present extensive empirical results in both the traditional and generalized zero-shot settings to highlight the benefits of the proposed methods. We provide useful insights into the algorithm and conclude by posing some open questions to encourage further research. 
### 283.A two-stage 3D Unet framework for multi-class segmentation on full  resolution image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04341.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been intensively used for multi-class segmentation of data from different modalities and achieved state-of-the-art performances. However, a common problem when dealing with large, high resolution 3D data is that the volumes input into the deep CNNs has to be either cropped or downsampled due to limited memory capacity of computing devices. These operations lead to loss of resolution and increment of class imbalance in the input data batches, which can downgrade the performances of segmentation algorithms. Inspired by the architecture of image super-resolution CNN (SRCNN) and self-normalization network (SNN), we developed a two-stage modified Unet framework that simultaneously learns to detect a ROI within the full volume and to classify voxels without losing the original resolution. Experiments on a variety of multi-modal volumes demonstrated that, when trained with a simply weighted dice coefficients and our customized learning procedure, this framework shows better segmentation performances than state-of-the-art Deep CNNs with advanced similarity metrics. 
### 284.A Recurrent CNN for Automatic Detection and Classification of Coronary  Artery Plaque and Stenosis in Coronary CT Angiography [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04360.pdf)
> Various types of atherosclerotic plaque and varying grades of stenosis could lead to different management of patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore, it is crucial to detect and classify the type of coronary artery plaque, as well as to detect and determine the degree of coronary artery stenosis. This study includes retrospectively collected clinically obtained coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans of 163 patients. To perform automatic analysis for coronary artery plaque and stenosis classification, a multi-task recurrent convolutional neural network is applied on multi-planar reformatted (MPR) images of the coronary arteries. First, a 3D convolutional neural network is utilized to extract features along the coronary artery. Subsequently, the extracted features are aggregated by a recurrent neural network that performs two simultaneous multi-class classification tasks. In the first task, the network detects and characterizes the type of the coronary artery plaque (no plaque, non-calcified, mixed, calcified). In the second task, the network detects and determines the anatomical significance of the coronary artery stenosis (no stenosis, non-significant i.e. &lt;50% luminal narrowing, significant i.e. &gt;50% luminal narrowing). For detection and classification of coronary plaque, the method achieved an accuracy of 0.77. For detection and classification of stenosis, the method achieved an accuracy of 0.80. The results demonstrate that automatic detection and classification of coronary artery plaque and stenosis are feasible. This may enable automated triage of patients to those without coronary plaque and those with coronary plaque and stenosis in need for further cardiovascular workup. 
### 285.Generative Adversarial Training for MRA Image Synthesis Using  Multi-Contrast MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04366.pdf)
> Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) has become an essential MR contrast for imaging and evaluation of vascular anatomy and related diseases. MRA acquisitions are typically ordered for vascular interventions, whereas in typical scenarios, MRA sequences can be absent in the patient scans. This motivates the need for a technique that generates inexistent MRA from existing MR multi-contrast, which could be a valuable tool in retrospective subject evaluations and imaging studies. In this paper, we present a generative adversarial network (GAN) based technique to generate MRA from T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI images, for the first time to our knowledge. To better model the representation of vessels which the MRA inherently highlights, we design a loss term dedicated to a faithful reproduction of vascularities. To that end, we incorporate steerable filter responses of the generated and reference images inside a Huber function loss term. Extending the well- established generator-discriminator architecture based on the recent PatchGAN model with the addition of steerable filter loss, the proposed steerable GAN (sGAN) method is evaluated on the large public database IXI. Experimental results show that the sGAN outperforms the baseline GAN method in terms of an overlap score with similar PSNR values, while it leads to improved visual perceptual quality. 
### 286.Image Correction via Deep Reciprocating HDR Transformation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04371.pdf)
> Image correction aims to adjust an input image into a visually pleasing one. Existing approaches are proposed mainly from the perspective of image pixel manipulation. They are not effective to recover the details in the under/over exposed regions. In this paper, we revisit the image formation procedure and notice that the missing details in these regions exist in the corresponding high dynamic range (HDR) data. These details are well perceived by the human eyes but diminished in the low dynamic range (LDR) domain because of the tone mapping process. Therefore, we formulate the image correction task as an HDR transformation process and propose a novel approach called Deep Reciprocating HDR Transformation (DRHT). Given an input LDR image, we first reconstruct the missing details in the HDR domain. We then perform tone mapping on the predicted HDR data to generate the output LDR image with the recovered details. To this end, we propose a united framework consisting of two CNNs for HDR reconstruction and tone mapping. They are integrated end-to-end for joint training and prediction. Experiments on the standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art image correction methods. 
### 287.Blood Vessel Geometry Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04381.pdf)
> Computationally synthesized blood vessels can be used for training and evaluation of medical image analysis applications. We propose a deep generative model to synthesize blood vessel geometries, with an application to coronary arteries in cardiac CT angiography (CCTA). <br />In the proposed method, a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (GAN) consisting of a generator and a discriminator network is trained. While the generator tries to synthesize realistic blood vessel geometries, the discriminator tries to distinguish synthesized geometries from those of real blood vessels. Both real and synthesized blood vessel geometries are parametrized as 1D signals based on the central vessel axis. The generator can optionally be provided with an attribute vector to synthesize vessels with particular characteristics. <br />The GAN was optimized using a reference database with parametrizations of 4,412 real coronary artery geometries extracted from CCTA scans. After training, plausible coronary artery geometries could be synthesized based on random vectors sampled from a latent space. A qualitative analysis showed strong similarities between real and synthesized coronary arteries. A detailed analysis of the latent space showed that the diversity present in coronary artery anatomy was accurately captured by the generator. <br />Results show that Wasserstein generative adversarial networks can be used to synthesize blood vessel geometries. 
### 288.Iterative fully convolutional neural networks for automatic vertebra  segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04383.pdf)
> Precise segmentation of the vertebrae is often required for automatic detection of vertebral abnormalities. This especially enables incidental detection of abnormalities such as compression fractures in images that were acquired for other diagnostic purposes. While many CT and MR scans of the chest and abdomen cover a section of the spine, they often do not cover the entire spine. Additionally, the first and last visible vertebrae are likely only partially included in such scans. In this paper, we therefore approach vertebra segmentation as an instance segmentation problem. A fully convolutional neural network is combined with an instance memory that retains information about already segmented vertebrae. This network iteratively analyzes image patches, using the instance memory to search for and segment the first not yet segmented vertebra. At the same time, each vertebra is classified as completely or partially visible, so that partially visible vertebrae can be excluded from further analyses. We evaluated this method on spine CT scans from a vertebra segmentation challenge and on low-dose chest CT scans. The method achieved an average Dice score of 95.8% and 92.1%, respectively, and a mean absolute surface distance of 0.194 mm and 0.344 mm. 
### 289.MGGAN: Solving Mode Collapse using Manifold Guided Training [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04391.pdf)
> Mode collapse is a critical problem in training generative adversarial networks. To alleviate mode collapse, several recent studies introduce new objective functions, network architectures or alternative training schemes. However, their achievement is often the result of sacrificing the image quality. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, namely a manifold guided generative adversarial network (MGGAN), which leverages a guidance network on existing GAN architecture to induce generator learning all modes of data distribution. Based on extensive evaluations, we show that our algorithm resolves mode collapse without losing image quality. In particular, we demonstrate that our algorithm is easily extendable to various existing GANs. Experimental analysis justifies that the proposed algorithm is an effective and efficient tool for training GANs. 
### 290.Multi-Label Wireless Interference Identification with Convolutional  Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04395.pdf)
> The steadily growing use of license-free frequency bands require reliable coexistence management and therefore proper wireless interference identification (WII). In this work, we propose a WII approach based upon a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which classifies multiple IEEE 802.15.1, IEEE 802.11 b/g and IEEE 802.15.4 interfering signals in the presence of a utilized signal. The generated multi-label dataset contains frequency- and time-limited sensing snapshots with the bandwidth of 10 MHz and duration of 12.8 $\mu$s, respectively. Each snapshot combines one utilized signal with up to multiple interfering signals. The approach shows promising results for same-technology interference with a classification accuracy of approximately 100 % for IEEE 802.15.1 and IEEE 802.15.4 signals. For IEEE 802.11 b/g signals the accuracy increases for cross-technology interference with at least 90 %. 
### 291.Social Anchor-Unit Graph Regularized Tensor Completion for Large-Scale  Image Retagging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04397.pdf)
> Image retagging aims to improve tag quality of social images by refining their original tags or assigning new high-quality tags. Recent approaches simultaneously explore visual, user and tag information to improve the performance of image retagging by constructing and exploring an image-tag-user graph. However, such methods will become computationally infeasible with the rapidly increasing number of images, tags and users. It has been proven that Anchor Graph Regularization (AGR) can significantly accelerate large-scale graph learning model by exploring only a small number of anchor points. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Social anchor-Unit GrAph Regularized Tensor Completion (SUGAR-TC) method to effectively refine the tags of social images, which is insensitive to the scale of the applied data. First, we construct an anchor-unit graph across multiple domains (e.g., image and user domains) rather than traditional anchor graph in a single domain. Second, a tensor completion based on SUGAR is implemented on the original image-tag-user tensor to refine the tags of the anchor images. Third, we efficiently assign tags to non-anchor images by leveraging the relationship between the non-anchor images and the anchor units. Experimental results on a real-world social image database well demonstrate the effectiveness of SUGAR-TC, outperforming several related methods. 
### 292.Unsupervised Discovery of Object Landmarks as Structural Representations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04412.pdf)
> Deep neural networks can model images with rich latent representations, but they cannot naturally conceptualize structures of object categories in a human-perceptible way. This paper addresses the problem of learning object structures in an image modeling process without supervision. We propose an autoencoding formulation to discover landmarks as explicit structural representations. The encoding module outputs landmark coordinates, whose validity is ensured by constraints that reflect the necessary properties for landmarks. The decoding module takes the landmarks as a part of the learnable input representations in an end-to-end differentiable framework. Our discovered landmarks are semantically meaningful and more predictive of manually annotated landmarks than those discovered by previous methods. The coordinates of our landmarks are also complementary features to pretrained deep-neural-network representations in recognizing visual attributes. In addition, the proposed method naturally creates an unsupervised, perceptible interface to manipulate object shapes and decode images with controllable structures.

### 293.Transformation on Computer-Generated Facial Image to Avoid Detection by  Spoofing Detector [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04418.pdf)
> Making computer-generated (CG) images more difficult to detect is an interesting problem in computer graphics and security. While most approaches focus on the image rendering phase, this paper presents a method based on increasing the naturalness of CG facial images from the perspective of spoofing detectors. The proposed method is implemented using a convolutional neural network (CNN) comprising two autoencoders and a transformer and is trained using a black-box discriminator without gradient information. Over 50% of the transformed CG images were not detected by three state-of-the-art spoofing detectors. This capability raises an alarm regarding the reliability of facial authentication systems, which are becoming widely used in daily life. 
### 294.Exploiting feature representations through similarity learning,  post-ranking and ranking aggregation for person re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04419.pdf)
> Person re-identification has received special attention by the human analysis community in the last few years. To address the challenges in this field, many researchers have proposed different strategies, which basically exploit either cross-view invariant features or cross-view robust metrics. In this work, we propose to exploit a post-ranking approach and combine different feature representations through ranking aggregation. Spatial information, which potentially benefits the person matching, is represented using a 2D body model, from which color and texture information are extracted and combined. We also consider background/foreground information, automatically extracted via Deep Decompositional Network, and the usage of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. To describe the matching between images we use the polynomial feature map, also taking into account local and global information. The Discriminant Context Information Analysis based post-ranking approach is used to improve initial ranking lists. Finally, the Stuart ranking aggregation method is employed to combine complementary ranking lists obtained from different feature representations. Experimental results demonstrated that we improve the state-of-the-art on VIPeR and PRID450s datasets, achieving 67.21% and 75.64% on top-1 rank recognition rate, respectively, as well as obtaining competitive results on CUHK01 dataset. 
### 295.Extraction of Airways using Graph Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04436.pdf)
> We present extraction of tree structures, such as airways, from image data as a graph refinement task. To this end, we propose a graph auto-encoder model that uses an encoder based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn embeddings from input node features and a decoder to predict connections between nodes. Performance of the GNN model is compared with mean-field networks in their ability to extract airways from 3D chest CT scans. 
### 296.Pooling is neither necessary nor sufficient for appropriate deformation  stability in CNNs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04438.pdf)
> Many of our core assumptions about how neural networks operate remain empirically untested. One common assumption is that convolutional neural networks need to be stable to small translations and deformations to solve image recognition tasks. For many years, this stability was baked into CNN architectures by incorporating interleaved pooling layers. Recently, however, interleaved pooling has largely been abandoned. This raises a number of questions: Are our intuitions about deformation stability right at all? Is it important? Is pooling necessary for deformation invariance? If not, how is deformation invariance achieved in its absence? In this work, we rigorously test these questions, and find that deformation stability in convolutional networks is more nuanced than it first appears: (1) Deformation invariance is not a binary property, but rather that different tasks require different degrees of deformation stability at different layers. (2) Deformation stability is not a fixed property of a network and is heavily adjusted over the course of training, largely through the smoothness of the convolutional filters. (3) Interleaved pooling layers are neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving the optimal form of deformation stability for natural image classification. (4) Pooling confers too much deformation stability for image classification at initialization, and during training, networks have to learn to counteract this inductive bias. Together, these findings provide new insights into the role of interleaved pooling and deformation invariance in CNNs, and demonstrate the importance of rigorous empirical testing of even our most basic assumptions about the working of neural networks. 
### 297.Distort-and-Recover: Color Enhancement using Deep Reinforcement Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04450.pdf)
> Learning-based color enhancement approaches typically learn to map from input images to retouched images. Most of existing methods require expensive pairs of input-retouched images or produce results in a non-interpretable way. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method for color enhancement to explicitly model the step-wise nature of human retouching process. We cast a color enhancement process as a Markov Decision Process where actions are defined as global color adjustment operations. Then we train our agent to learn the optimal global enhancement sequence of the actions. In addition, we present a 'distort-and-recover' training scheme which only requires high-quality reference images for training instead of input and retouched image pairs. Given high-quality reference images, we distort the images' color distribution and form distorted-reference image pairs for training. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method produces decent enhancement results and our DRL approach is more suitable for the 'distort-and-recover' training scheme than previous supervised approaches.

### 298.CubeNet: Equivariance to 3D Rotation and Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04458.pdf)
> 3D Convolutional Neural Networks are sensitive to transformations applied to their input. This is a problem because a voxelized version of a 3D object, and its rotated clone, will look unrelated to each other after passing through to the last layer of a network. Instead, an idealized model would preserve a meaningful representation of the voxelized object, while explaining the pose-difference between the two inputs. An equivariant representation vector has two components: the invariant identity part, and a discernable encoding of the transformation. Models that can't explain pose-differences risk "diluting" the representation, in pursuit of optimizing a classification or regression loss function. <br />We introduce a Group Convolutional Neural Network with linear equivariance to translations and right angle rotations in three dimensions. We call this network CubeNet, reflecting its cube-like symmetry. By construction, this network helps preserve a 3D shape's global and local signature, as it is transformed through successive layers. We apply this network to a variety of 3D inference problems, achieving state-of-the-art on the ModelNet10 classification challenge, and comparable performance on the ISBI 2012 Connectome Segmentation Benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 3D rotation equivariant CNN for voxel representations. 
### 299.PCN: Part and Context Information for Pedestrian Detection with CNNs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04483.pdf)
> Pedestrian detection has achieved great improvements in recent years, while complex occlusion handling is still one of the most important problems. To take advantage of the body parts and context information for pedestrian detection, we propose the part and context network (PCN) in this work. PCN specially utilizes two branches which detect the pedestrians through body parts semantic and context information, respectively. In the Part Branch, the semantic information of body parts can communicate with each other via recurrent neural networks. In the Context Branch, we adopt a local competition mechanism for adaptive context scale selection. By combining the outputs of all branches, we develop a strong complementary pedestrian detector with a lower miss rate and better localization accuracy, especially for occlusion pedestrian. Comprehensive evaluations on two challenging pedestrian detection datasets (i.e. Caltech and INRIA) well demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed PCN. 
### 300.Deep Autoencoding Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation in Brain  MR Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04488.pdf)
> Reliably modeling normality and differentiating abnormal appearances from normal cases is a very appealing approach for detecting pathologies in medical images. A plethora of such unsupervised anomaly detection approaches has been made in the medical domain, based on statistical methods, content-based retrieval, clustering and recently also deep learning. Previous approaches towards deep unsupervised anomaly detection model patches of normal anatomy with variants of Autoencoders or GANs, and detect anomalies either as outliers in the learned feature space or from large reconstruction errors. In contrast to these patch-based approaches, we show that deep spatial autoencoding models can be efficiently used to capture normal anatomical variability of entire 2D brain MR images. A variety of experiments on real MR data containing MS lesions corroborates our hypothesis that we can detect and even delineate anomalies in brain MR images by simply comparing input images to their reconstruction. Results show that constraints on the latent space and adversarial training can further improve the segmentation performance over standard deep representation learning. 
### 301.Simultaneous Fidelity and Regularization Learning for Image Restoration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04522.pdf)
> Most existing non-blind restoration methods are based on the assumption that a precise degradation model is known. As the degradation process can only partially known or inaccurately modeled, images may not be well restored. Rain streak removal and image deconvolution with inaccurate blur kernels are two representative examples of such tasks. For rain streak removal, although an input image can be decomposed into a scene layer and a rain streak layer, there exists no explicit formulation for modeling rain streaks and the composition with scene layer. For blind deconvolution, as estimation error of blur kernel is usually introduced, the subsequent non-blind deconvolution process does not restore the latent image well. In this paper, we propose a principled algorithm within the maximum a posterior framework to tackle image restoration with a partially known or inaccurate degradation model. Specifically, the residual caused by a partially known or inaccurate degradation model is spatially dependent and complexly distributed. With a training set of degraded and ground-truth image pairs, we parameterize and learn the fidelity term for a degradation model in a task-driven manner. Furthermore, the regularization term can also be learned along with the fidelity term, thereby forming a simultaneous fidelity and regularization learning model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for image deconvolution with inaccurate blur kernels and rain streak removal. Furthermore, for image restoration with precise degradation process, e.g., Gaussian denoising, the proposed model can be applied to learn the proper fidelity term for optimal performance based on visual perception metrics. 
### 302.SoccerNet: A Scalable Dataset for Action Spotting in Soccer Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04527.pdf)
> In this paper, we introduce SoccerNet, a benchmark for action spotting in soccer videos. The dataset is composed of 500 complete soccer games from six main European leagues, covering three seasons from 2014 to 2017 and a total duration of 764 hours. A total of 6,637 temporal annotations are automatically parsed from online match reports at a one minute resolution for three main classes of events (Goal, Yellow/Red Card, and Substitution). As such, the dataset is easily scalable. These annotations are manually refined to a one second resolution by anchoring them at a single timestamp following well-defined soccer rules. With an average of one event every 6.9 minutes, this dataset focuses on the problem of localizing very sparse events within long videos. We define the task of spotting as finding the anchors of soccer events in a video. Making use of recent developments in the realm of generic action recognition and detection in video, we provide strong baselines for detecting soccer events. We show that our best model for classifying temporal segments of length one minute reaches a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 67.8%. For the spotting task, our baseline reaches an Average-mAP of 49.7% for tolerances $\delta$ ranging from 5 to 60 seconds. Our dataset and models are available at <a href="https://silviogiancola.github.io/SoccerNet.">this https URL</a> 
### 303.Generative Visual Rationales [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04539.pdf)
> Interpretability and small labelled datasets are key issues in the practical application of deep learning, particularly in areas such as medicine. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised technique that addresses both these issues by leveraging large unlabelled datasets to encode and decode images into a dense latent representation. Using chest radiography as an example, we apply this encoder to other labelled datasets and apply simple models to the latent vectors to learn algorithms to identify heart failure. <br />For each prediction, we generate visual rationales by optimizing a latent representation to minimize the prediction of disease while constrained by a similarity measure in image space. Decoding the resultant latent representation produces an image without apparent disease. The difference between the original decoding and the altered image forms an interpretable visual rationale for the algorithm's prediction on that image. We also apply our method to the MNIST dataset and compare the generated rationales to other techniques described in the literature. 
### 304.A Neural Markovian Concurrent Image Labeling Algorithm [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04540.pdf)
> This paper describes the MCV image labeling algorithm which is a (semi-) hierarchical algorithm commencing with a partition made up of single pixel regions and merging regions or subsets of regions using a Markov random field (MRF) image model. It is an example of a general approach to computer vision called concurrent vision in which the operations of image segmentation and image classification are carried out concurrently. The output of the MCV algorithm can be a simple segmentation partition or a sequence of partitions which can provide useful information to higher level vision systems. In the case of an autoregressive Gaussian MRF the evaluation of sub-images for homogeneity is computationally inexpensive and may be effected by a hardwired feed-forward neural network. The merge operation of the algorithm is massively parallelizable. While being applicable to images (i.e. 2D signals), the algorithm is equally applicable to 1D signals (e.g. speech) or 3D signals (e.g. video sequences) 
### 305.Forecasting Future Humphrey Visual Fields Using Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04543.pdf)
> Purpose: To determine if deep learning networks could be trained to forecast a future 24-2 Humphrey Visual Field (HVF). <br />Participants: All patients who obtained a HVF 24-2 at the University of Washington. <br />Methods: All datapoints from consecutive 24-2 HVFs from 1998 to 2018 were extracted from a University of Washington database. Ten-fold cross validation with a held out test set was used to develop the three main phases of model development: model architecture selection, dataset combination selection, and time-interval model training with transfer learning, to train a deep learning artificial neural network capable of generating a point-wise visual field prediction. <br />Results: More than 1.7 million perimetry points were extracted to the hundredth decibel from 32,443 24-2 HVFs. The best performing model with 20 million trainable parameters, CascadeNet-5, was selected. The overall MAE for the test set was 2.47 dB (95% CI: 2.45 dB to 2.48 dB). The 100 fully trained models were able to successfully predict progressive field loss in glaucomatous eyes up to 5.5 years in the future with a correlation of 0.92 between the MD of predicted and actual future HVF (p &lt; 2.2 x 10 -16 ) and an average difference of 0.41 dB. <br />Conclusions: Using unfiltered real-world datasets, deep learning networks show an impressive ability to not only learn spatio-temporal HVF changes but also to generate predictions for future HVFs up to 5.5 years, given only a single HVF. 
### 306.Seed-Point Based Geometric Partitioning of Nuclei Clumps [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04549.pdf)
> When applying automatic analysis of fluorescence or histopathological images of cells, it is necessary to partition, or de-clump, partially overlapping cell nuclei. In this work, I describe a method of partitioning partially overlapping cell nuclei using a seed-point based geometric partitioning. The geometric partitioning creates two different types of cuts, cuts between two boundary vertices and cuts between one boundary vertex and a new vertex introduced to the boundary interior. The cuts are then ranked according to a scoring metric, and the highest scoring cuts are used. This method was tested on a set of 2420 clumps of nuclei and was found to produced better results than current popular analysis software. 
### 307.Trajectory Factory: Tracklet Cleaving and Re-connection by Deep Siamese  Bi-GRU for Multiple Object Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04555.pdf)
> Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a challenging task in the complex scene such as surveillance and autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a novel tracklet processing method to cleave and re-connect tracklets on crowd or long-term occlusion by Siamese Bi-Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The tracklet generation utilizes object features extracted by CNN and RNN to create the high-confidence tracklet candidates in sparse scenario. Due to mis-tracking in the generation process, the tracklets from different objects are split into several sub-tracklets by a bidirectional GRU. After that, a Siamese GRU based tracklet re-connection method is applied to link the sub-tracklets which belong to the same object to form a whole trajectory. In addition, we extract the tracklet images from existing MOT datasets and propose a novel dataset to train our networks. The proposed dataset contains more than 95160 pedestrian images. It has 793 different persons in it. On average, there are 120 images for each person with positions and sizes. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our model over the state-of-the-art methods on MOT16. 
### 308.Towards integrating spatial localization in convolutional neural  networks for brain image segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04563.pdf)
> Semantic segmentation is an established while rapidly evolving field in medical imaging. In this paper we focus on the segmentation of brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) into cerebral structures using convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNNs achieve good performance by finding effective high dimensional image features describing the patch content only. In this work, we propose different ways to introduce spatial constraints into the network to further reduce prediction inconsistencies. <br />A patch based CNN architecture was trained, making use of multiple scales to gather contextual information. Spatial constraints were introduced within the CNN through a distance to landmarks feature or through the integration of a probability atlas. We demonstrate experimentally that using spatial information helps to reduce segmentation inconsistencies. 
### 309.Improving Classification Rate of Schizophrenia Using a Multimodal  Multi-Layer Perceptron Model with Structural and Functional MR [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04591.pdf)
> The wide variety of brain imaging technologies allows us to exploit information inherent to different data modalities. The richness of multimodal datasets may increase predictive power and reveal latent variables that otherwise would have not been found. However, the analysis of multimodal data is often conducted by assuming linear interactions which impact the accuracy of the results. We propose the use of a multimodal multi-layer perceptron model to enhance the predictive power of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI and fMRI) combined. <br />We also use a synthetic data generator to pre-train each modality input layers, alleviating the effects of the small sample size that is often the case for brain imaging modalities. The proposed model improved the average and uncertainty of the area under the ROC curve to 0.850+-0.051 compared to the best results on individual modalities (0.741+-0.075 for sMRI, and 0.833+-0.050 for fMRI). 
### 310.Deformation Aware Image Compression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04593.pdf)
> Lossy compression algorithms aim to compactly encode images in a way which enables to restore them with minimal error. We show that a key limitation of existing algorithms is that they rely on error measures that are extremely sensitive to geometric deformations (e.g. SSD, SSIM). These force the encoder to invest many bits in describing the exact geometry of every fine detail in the image, which is obviously wasteful, because the human visual system is indifferent to small local translations. Motivated by this observation, we propose a deformation-insensitive error measure that can be easily incorporated into any existing compression scheme. As we show, optimal compression under our criterion involves slightly deforming the input image such that it becomes more "compressible". Surprisingly, while these small deformations are barely noticeable, they enable the CODEC to preserve details that are otherwise completely lost. Our technique uses the CODEC as a "black box", thus allowing simple integration with arbitrary compression methods. Extensive experiments, including user studies, confirm that our approach significantly improves the visual quality of many CODECs. These include JPEG, JPEG2000, WebP, BPG, and a recent deep-net method. 
### 311.Assessment of Breast Cancer Histology using Densely Connected  Convolutional Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04595.pdf)
> Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and leading cause of cancer-related death among females worldwide. In this article, we investigate the applicability of densely connected convolutional neural networks to the problems of histology image classification and whole slide image segmentation in the area of computer-aided diagnoses for breast cancer. To this end, we study various approaches for transfer learning and apply them to the data set from the 2018 grand challenge on breast cancer histology images (BACH). 
### 312.Personalized Classifier for Food Image Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04600.pdf)
> Currently, food image recognition tasks are evaluated against fixed datasets. However, in real-world conditions, there are cases in which the number of samples in each class continues to increase and samples from novel classes appear. In particular, dynamic datasets in which each individual user creates samples and continues the updating process often have content that varies considerably between different users, and the number of samples per person is very limited. A single classifier common to all users cannot handle such dynamic data. Bridging the gap between the laboratory environment and the real world has not yet been accomplished on a large scale. Personalizing a classifier incrementally for each user is a promising way to do this. In this paper, we address the personalization problem, which involves adapting to the user's domain incrementally using a very limited number of samples. We propose a simple yet effective personalization framework which is a combination of the nearest class mean classifier and the 1-nearest neighbor classifier based on deep features. To conduct realistic experiments, we made use of a new dataset of daily food images collected by a food-logging application. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods. 
### 313.Expressway visibility estimation based on image entropy and piecewise  stationary time series analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04601.pdf)
> Vision-based methods for visibility estimation can play a critical role in reducing traffic accidents caused by fog and haze. To overcome the disadvantages of current visibility estimation methods, we present a novel data-driven approach based on Gaussian image entropy and piecewise stationary time series analysis (SPEV). This is the first time that Gaussian image entropy is used for estimating atmospheric visibility. To lessen the impact of landscape and sunshine illuminance on visibility estimation, we used region of interest (ROI) analysis and took into account relative ratios of image entropy, to improve estimation accuracy. We assume fog and haze cause blurred images and that fog and haze can be considered as a piecewise stationary signal. We used piecewise stationary time series analysis to construct the piecewise causal relationship between image entropy and visibility. To obtain a real-world visibility measure during fog and haze, a subjective assessment was established through a study with 36 subjects who performed visibility observations. Finally, a total of two million videos were used for training the SPEV model and validate its effectiveness. The videos were collected from the constantly foggy and hazy Tongqi expressway in Jiangsu, China. The contrast model of visibility estimation was used for algorithm performance comparison, and the validation results of the SPEV model were encouraging as 99.14% of the relative errors were less than 10%. 
### 314.Pilot Comparative Study of Different Deep Features for Palmprint  Identification in Low-Quality Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04602.pdf)
> Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widespread, efficient tools of visual recognition. In this paper, we present a comparative study of three popular pre-trained CNN models: AlexNet, VGG-16 and VGG-19. We address the problem of palmprint identification in low-quality imagery and apply Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with all of the compared models. For the comparison, we use the MOHI palmprint image database whose images are characterized by low contrast, shadows, and varying illumination, scale, translation and rotation. Another, high-quality database called COEP is also considered to study the recognition gap between high-quality and low-quality imagery. Our experiments show that the deeper pre-trained CNN models, e.g., VGG-16 and VGG-19, tend to extract highly distinguishable features that recognize low-quality palmprints more efficiently than the less deep networks such as AlexNet. Furthermore, our experiments on the two databases using various models demonstrate that the features extracted from lower-level fully connected layers provide higher recognition rates than higher-layer features. Our results indicate that different pre-trained models can be efficiently used in touchless identification systems with low-quality palmprint images. 
### 315.Outline Objects using Deep Reinforcement Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04603.pdf)
> Image segmentation needs both local boundary position information and global object context information. The performance of the recent state-of-the-art method, fully convolutional networks, reaches a bottleneck due to the neural network limit after balancing between the two types of information simultaneously in an end-to-end training style. To overcome this problem, we divide the semantic image segmentation into temporal subtasks. First, we find a possible pixel position of some object boundary; then trace the boundary at steps within a limited length until the whole object is outlined. We present the first deep reinforcement learning approach to semantic image segmentation, called DeepOutline, which outperforms other algorithms in Coco detection leaderboard in the middle and large size person category in Coco val2017 dataset. Meanwhile, it provides an insight into a divide and conquer way by reinforcement learning on computer vision problems. 
### 316.Discovery and usage of joint attention in images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04604.pdf)
> Joint visual attention is characterized by two or more individuals looking at a common target at the same time. The ability to identify joint attention in scenes, the people involved, and their common target, is fundamental to the understanding of social interactions, including others' intentions and goals. In this work we deal with the extraction of joint attention events, and the use of such events for image descriptions. The work makes two novel contributions. First, our extraction algorithm is the first which identifies joint visual attention in single static images. It computes 3D gaze direction, identifies the gaze target by combining gaze direction with a 3D depth map computed for the image, and identifies the common gaze target. Second, we use a human study to demonstrate the sensitivity of humans to joint attention, suggesting that the detection of such a configuration in an image can be useful for understanding the image, including the goals of the agents and their joint activity, and therefore can contribute to image captioning and related tasks. 
### 317.Loss Rank Mining: A General Hard Example Mining Method for Real-time  Detectors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04606.pdf)
> Modern object detectors usually suffer from low accuracy issues, as foregrounds always drown in tons of backgrounds and become hard examples during training. Compared with those proposal-based ones, real-time detectors are in far more serious trouble since they renounce the use of region-proposing stage which is used to filter a majority of backgrounds for achieving real-time rates. Though foregrounds as hard examples are in urgent need of being mined from tons of backgrounds, a considerable number of state-of-the-art real-time detectors, like YOLO series, have yet to profit from existing hard example mining methods, as using these methods need detectors fit series of prerequisites. In this paper, we propose a general hard example mining method named Loss Rank Mining (LRM) to fill the gap. LRM is a general method for real-time detectors, as it utilizes the final feature map which exists in all real-time detectors to mine hard examples. By using LRM, some elements representing easy examples in final feature map are filtered and detectors are forced to concentrate on hard examples during training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. With our method, the improvements of YOLOv2 detector on auto-driving related dataset KITTI and more general dataset PASCAL VOC are over 5% and 2% mAP, respectively. In addition, LRM is the first hard example mining strategy which could fit YOLOv2 perfectly and make it better applied in series of real scenarios where both real-time rates and accurate detection are strongly demanded. 
### 318.Pix3D: Dataset and Methods for Single-Image 3D Shape Modeling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04610.pdf)
> We study 3D shape modeling from a single image and make contributions to it in three aspects. First, we present Pix3D, a large-scale benchmark of diverse image-shape pairs with pixel-level 2D-3D alignment. Pix3D has wide applications in shape-related tasks including reconstruction, retrieval, viewpoint estimation, etc. Building such a large-scale dataset, however, is highly challenging; existing datasets either contain only synthetic data, or lack precise alignment between 2D images and 3D shapes, or only have a small number of images. Second, we calibrate the evaluation criteria for 3D shape reconstruction through behavioral studies, and use them to objectively and systematically benchmark cutting-edge reconstruction algorithms on Pix3D. Third, we design a novel model that simultaneously performs 3D reconstruction and pose estimation; our multi-task learning approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks. 
### 319.An efficient CNN for spectral reconstruction from RGB images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04647.pdf)
> Recently, the example-based single image spectral reconstruction from RGB images task, aka, spectral super-resolution was approached by means of deep learning by Galliani et al. The proposed very deep convolutional neural network (CNN) achieved superior performance on recent large benchmarks. However, Aeschbacher et al showed that comparable performance can be achieved by shallow learning method based on A+, a method introduced for image super-resolution by Timofte et al. In this paper, we propose a moderately deep CNN model and substantially improve the reported performance on three spectral reconstruction standard benchmarks: ICVL, CAVE, and NUS. 
### 320.Cross-Domain Visual Recognition via Domain Adaptive Dictionary Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04687.pdf)
> In real-world visual recognition problems, the assumption that the training data (source domain) and test data (target domain) are sampled from the same distribution is often violated. This is known as the domain adaptation problem. In this work, we propose a novel domain-adaptive dictionary learning framework for cross-domain visual recognition. Our method generates a set of intermediate domains. These intermediate domains form a smooth path and bridge the gap between the source and target domains. Specifically, we not only learn a common dictionary to encode the domain-shared features, but also learn a set of domain-specific dictionaries to model the domain shift. The separation of the common and domain-specific dictionaries enables us to learn more compact and reconstructive dictionaries for domain adaptation. These dictionaries are learned by alternating between domain-adaptive sparse coding and dictionary updating steps. Meanwhile, our approach gradually recovers the feature representations of both source and target data along the domain path. By aligning all the recovered domain data, we derive the final domain-adaptive features for cross-domain visual recognition. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrates that our approach outperforms most state-of-the-art methods. 
### 321.A Variational U-Net for Conditional Appearance and Shape Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04694.pdf)
> Deep generative models have demonstrated great performance in image synthesis. However, results deteriorate in case of spatial deformations, since they generate images of objects directly, rather than modeling the intricate interplay of their inherent shape and appearance. We present a conditional U-Net for shape-guided image generation, conditioned on the output of a variational autoencoder for appearance. The approach is trained end-to-end on images, without requiring samples of the same object with varying pose or appearance. Experiments show that the model enables conditional image generation and transfer. Therefore, either shape or appearance can be retained from a query image, while freely altering the other. Moreover, appearance can be sampled due to its stochastic latent representation, while preserving shape. In quantitative and qualitative experiments on COCO, DeepFashion, shoes, Market-1501 and handbags, the approach demonstrates significant improvements over the state-of-the-art. 
### 322.Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04732.pdf)
> Unsupervised image-to-image translation is an important and challenging problem in computer vision. Given an image in the source domain, the goal is to learn the conditional distribution of corresponding images in the target domain, without seeing any pairs of corresponding images. While this conditional distribution is inherently multimodal, existing approaches make an overly simplified assumption, modeling it as a deterministic one-to-one mapping. As a result, they fail to generate diverse outputs from a given source domain image. To address this limitation, we propose a Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-image Translation (MUNIT) framework. We assume that the image representation can be decomposed into a content code that is domain-invariant, and a style code that captures domain-specific properties. To translate an image to another domain, we recombine its content code with a random style code sampled from the style space of the target domain. We analyze the proposed framework and establish several theoretical results. Extensive experiments with comparisons to the state-of-the-art approaches further demonstrates the advantage of the proposed framework. Moreover, our framework allows users to control the style of translation outputs by providing an example style image. Code and pretrained models are available at <a href="https://github.com/nvlabs/MUNIT">this https URL</a> 
### 323.A Hybrid Model for Identity Obfuscation by Face Replacement [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04779.pdf)
> As more and more personal photos are shared and tagged in social media, avoiding privacy risks such as unintended recognition becomes increasingly challenging. We propose a new hybrid approach to obfuscate identities in photos by head replacement. Our approach combines state of the art parametric face synthesis with latest advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for data-driven image synthesis. On the one hand, the parametric part of our method gives us control over the facial parameters and allows for explicit manipulation of the identity. On the other hand, the data-driven aspects allow for adding fine details and overall realism as well as seamless blending into the scene context. In our experiments, we show highly realistic output of our system that improves over the previous state of the art in obfuscation rate while preserving a higher similarity to the original image content. 
### 324.FishEyeRecNet: A Multi-Context Collaborative Deep Network for Fisheye  Image Rectification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04784.pdf)
> Images captured by fisheye lenses violate the pinhole camera assumption and suffer from distortions. Rectification of fisheye images is therefore a crucial preprocessing step for many computer vision applications. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-context collaborative deep network for removing distortions from single fisheye images. In contrast to conventional approaches, which focus on extracting hand-crafted features from input images, our method learns high-level semantics and low-level appearance features simultaneously to estimate the distortion parameters. To facilitate training, we construct a synthesized dataset that covers various scenes and distortion parameter settings. Experiments on both synthesized and real-world datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms current state of the art methods. Our code and synthesized dataset will be made publicly available. 
### 325.Deep Motion Boundary Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04785.pdf)
> Motion boundary detection is a crucial yet challenging problem. Prior methods focus on analyzing the gradients and distributions of optical flow fields, or use hand-crafted features for motion boundary learning. In this paper, we propose the first dedicated end-to-end deep learning approach for motion boundary detection, which we term as MoBoNet. We introduce a refinement network structure which takes source input images, initial forward and backward optical flows as well as corresponding warping errors as inputs and produces high-resolution motion boundaries. Furthermore, we show that the obtained motion boundaries, through a fusion sub-network we design, can in turn guide the optical flows for removing the artifacts. The proposed MoBoNet is generic and works with any optical flows. Our motion boundary detection and the refined optical flow estimation achieve results superior to the state of the art. 
### 326.Talking Face Generation by Conditional Recurrent Adversarial Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04786.pdf)
> Given an arbitrary face image and an arbitrary speech clip, the proposed work attempts to generating the talking face video with accurate lip synchronization while maintaining smooth transition of both lip and facial movement over the entire video clip. Existing works either do not consider temporal dependency on face images across different video frames thus easily yielding noticeable/abrupt facial and lip movement or are only limited to the generation of talking face video for a specific person thus lacking generalization capacity. We propose a novel conditional video generation network where the audio input is treated as a condition for the recurrent adversarial network such that temporal dependency is incorporated to realize smooth transition for the lip and facial movement. In addition, we deploy a multi-task adversarial training scheme in the context of video generation to improve both photo-realism and the accuracy for lip synchronization. Finally, based on the phoneme distribution information extracted from the audio clip, we develop a sample selection method that effectively reduces the size of the training dataset without sacrificing the quality of the generated video. Extensive experiments on both controlled and uncontrolled datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of visual quality, lip sync accuracy, and smooth transition of lip and facial movement, as compared to the state-of-the-art. 
### 327.Precise Temporal Action Localization by Evolving Temporal Proposals [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04803.pdf)
> Locating actions in long untrimmed videos has been a challenging problem in video content analysis. The performances of existing action localization approaches remain unsatisfactory in precisely determining the beginning and the end of an action. Imitating the human perception procedure with observations and refinements, we propose a novel three-phase action localization framework. Our framework is embedded with an Actionness Network to generate initial proposals through frame-wise similarity grouping, and then a Refinement Network to conduct boundary adjustment on these proposals. Finally, the refined proposals are sent to a Localization Network for further fine-grained location regression. The whole process can be deemed as multi-stage refinement using a novel non-local pyramid feature under various temporal granularities. We evaluate our framework on THUMOS14 benchmark and obtain a significant improvement over the state-of-the-arts approaches. Specifically, the performance gain is remarkable under precise localization with high IoU thresholds. Our proposed framework achieves mAP@IoU=0.5 of 34.2%. 
### 328.Learning Deep Sketch Abstraction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04804.pdf)
> Human free-hand sketches have been studied in various contexts including sketch recognition, synthesis and fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR). A fundamental challenge for sketch analysis is to deal with drastically different human drawing styles, particularly in terms of abstraction level. In this work, we propose the first stroke-level sketch abstraction model based on the insight of sketch abstraction as a process of trading off between the recognizability of a sketch and the number of strokes used to draw it. Concretely, we train a model for abstract sketch generation through reinforcement learning of a stroke removal policy that learns to predict which strokes can be safely removed without affecting recognizability. We show that our abstraction model can be used for various sketch analysis tasks including: (1) modeling stroke saliency and understanding the decision of sketch recognition models, (2) synthesizing sketches of variable abstraction for a given category, or reference object instance in a photo, and (3) training a FG-SBIR model with photos only, bypassing the expensive photo-sketch pair collection step. 
### 329.MSnet: Mutual Suppression Network for Disentangled Video Representations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04810.pdf)
> The extraction of meaningful features from videos is important as they can be used in various applications. Despite its importance, video representation learning has not been studied much, because it is challenging to deal with both content and motion information. We present a Mutual Suppression network (MSnet) to learn disentangled motion and content features in videos. The MSnet is trained in such way that content features do not contain motion information and motion features do not contain content information; this is done by suppressing each other with adversarial training. We utilize the disentangled features from the MSnet for several tasks, such as frame reproduction, pixel-level video frame prediction, and dense optical flow estimation, to demonstrate the strength of MSnet. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in pixel-level video frame prediction. The source code will be publicly available. 
### 330.Offline and Online calibration of Mobile Robot and SLAM Device for  Navigation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04817.pdf)
> Robot navigation technology is required to accomplish difficult tasks in various environments. In navigation, it is necessary to know the information of the external environments and the state of the robot under the environment. On the other hand, various studies have been done on SLAM technology, which is also used for navigation, but also applied to devices for Mixed Reality and the like. <br />In this paper, we propose a robot-device calibration method for navigation with a device using SLAM technology on a robot. The calibration is performed by using the position and orientation information given by the robot and the device. In the calibration, the most efficient way of movement is clarified according to the restriction of the robot movement. Furthermore, we also show a method to dynamically correct the position and orientation of the robot so that the information of the external environment and the shape information of the robot maintain consistency in order to reduce the dynamic error occurring during navigation. <br />Our method can be easily used for various kinds of robots and localization with sufficient precision for navigation is possible with offline calibration and online position correction. In the experiments, we confirm the parameters obtained by two types of offline calibration according to the degree of freedom of robot movement and validate the effectiveness of online correction method by plotting localized position error during robot's intense movement. Finally, we show the demonstration of navigation using SLAM device. 
### 331.Spline Error Weighting for Robust Visual-Inertial Fusion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04820.pdf)
> In this paper we derive and test a probability-based weighting that can balance residuals of different types in spline fitting. In contrast to previous formulations, the proposed spline error weighting scheme also incorporates a prediction of the approximation error of the spline fit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the prediction in a synthetic experiment, and apply it to visual-inertial fusion on rolling shutter cameras. This results in a method that can estimate 3D structure with metric scale on generic first-person videos. We also propose a quality measure for spline fitting, that can be used to automatically select the knot spacing. Experiments verify that the obtained trajectory quality corresponds well with the requested quality. Finally, by linearly scaling the weights, we show that the proposed spline error weighting minimizes the estimation errors on real sequences, in terms of scale and end-point errors. 
### 332.Learning Warped Guidance for Blind Face Restoration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04829.pdf)
> This paper studies the problem of blind face restoration from an unconstrained blurry, noisy, low-resolution, or compressed image (i.e., degraded observation). For better recovery of fine facial details, we modify the problem setting by taking both the degraded observation and a high-quality guided image of the same identity as input to our guided face restoration network (GFRNet). However, the degraded observation and guided image generally are different in pose, illumination and expression, thereby making plain CNNs (e.g., U-Net) fail to recover fine and identity-aware facial details. To tackle this issue, our GFRNet model includes both a warping subnetwork (WarpNet) and a reconstruction subnetwork (RecNet). The WarpNet is introduced to predict flow field for warping the guided image to correct pose and expression (i.e., warped guidance), while the RecNet takes the degraded observation and warped guidance as input to produce the restoration result. Due to that the ground-truth flow field is unavailable, landmark loss together with total variation regularization are incorporated to guide the learning of WarpNet. Furthermore, to make the model applicable to blind restoration, our GFRNet is trained on the synthetic data with versatile settings on blur kernel, noise level, downsampling scale factor, and JPEG quality factor. Experiments show that our GFRNet not only performs favorably against the state-of-the-art image and face restoration methods, but also generates visually photo-realistic results on real degraded facial images. 
### 333.BodyNet: Volumetric Inference of 3D Human Body Shapes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04875.pdf)
> Human shape estimation is an important task for video editing, animation and fashion industry. Predicting 3D human body shape from natural images, however, is highly challenging due to factors such as variation in human bodies, clothing and viewpoint. Prior methods addressing this problem typically attempt to fit parametric body models with certain priors on pose and shape. In this work we argue for an alternative representation and propose BodyNet, a neural network for direct inference of volumetric body shape from a single image. BodyNet is an end-to-end trainable network that benefits from (i) a volumetric 3D loss, (ii) a multi-view re-projection loss, and (iii) intermediate supervision of 2D pose, 2D body part segmentation, and 3D pose. Each of them results in performance improvement as demonstrated by our experiments. To evaluate the method, we fit the SMPL model to our network output and show state-of-the-art results on the SURREAL and Unite the People datasets, outperforming recent approaches. Besides achieving state-of-the-art performance, our method also enables volumetric body-part segmentation. 
### 334.Group Anomaly Detection using Deep Generative Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04876.pdf)
> Unlike conventional anomaly detection research that focuses on point anomalies, our goal is to detect anomalous collections of individual data points. In particular, we perform group anomaly detection (GAD) with an emphasis on irregular group distributions (e.g. irregular mixtures of image pixels). GAD is an important task in detecting unusual and anomalous phenomena in real-world applications such as high energy particle physics, social media, and medical imaging. In this paper, we take a generative approach by proposing deep generative models: Adversarial autoencoder (AAE) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for group anomaly detection. Both AAE and VAE detect group anomalies using point-wise input data where group memberships are known a priori. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our models on real-world datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is effective and robust in detecting group anomalies. 
### 335.Learning to Exploit the Prior Network Knowledge for Weakly-Supervised  Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04882.pdf)
> Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for semantic segmentation typically requires to collect a large amount of accurate pixel-level annotations, a hard and expensive task. In contrast, simple image tags are easier to gather. With this paper we introduce a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation model able to learn from image labels, and just image labels. Our model uses the prior knowledge of a network trained for image recognition, employing these image annotations, as an attention mechanism to identify semantic regions in the images. We then present a methodology that builds accurate class-specific segmentation masks from these regions, where neither external objectness nor saliency algorithms are required. We describe how to incorporate this mask generation strategy into a fully end-to-end trainable process where the network jointly learns to classify and segment images. Our experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset show that exploiting these generated class-specific masks in conjunction with our novel end-to-end learning process outperforms several recent weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods that use image tags only, and even some models that leverage additional supervision or training data. 
### 336.Pose estimation of a single circle using default intrinsic calibration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04922.pdf)
> Circular markers are planar markers which offer great performances for detection and pose estimation. For an uncalibrated camera with an unknown focal length, at least the images of at least two coplanar circles are generally required to recover their poses. Unfortunately, detecting more than one ellipse in the image must be tricky and time-consuming, especially regarding concentric circles. On the other hand, when the camera is calibrated, one circle suffices but the solution is twofold and can hardly be disambiguated. Our contribution is to put beyond this limit by dealing with the uncalibrated case of a camera seeing one circle and discussing how to remove the ambiguity. We propose a new problem formulation that enables to show how to detect geometric configurations in which the ambiguity can be removed. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of default camera intrinsics and show, using intensive empirical works, the surprising observation that very approximate calibration can lead to accurate circle pose estimation. 
### 337.CNN-based Landmark Detection in Cardiac CTA Scans [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04963.pdf)
> Fast and accurate anatomical landmark detection can benefit many medical image analysis methods. Here, we propose a method to automatically detect anatomical landmarks in medical images. Automatic landmark detection is performed with a patch-based fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) that combines regression and classification. For any given image patch, regression is used to predict the 3D displacement vector from the image patch to the landmark. Simultaneously, classification is used to identify patches that contain the landmark. Under the assumption that patches close to a landmark can determine the landmark location more precisely than patches farther from it, only those patches that contain the landmark according to classification are used to determine the landmark location. The landmark location is obtained by calculating the average landmark location using the computed 3D displacement vectors. The method is evaluated using detection of six clinically relevant landmarks in coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans: the right and left ostium, the bifurcation of the left main coronary artery (LM) into the left anterior descending and the left circumflex artery, and the origin of the right, non-coronary, and left aortic valve commissure. The proposed method achieved an average Euclidean distance error of 2.19 mm and 2.88 mm for the right and left ostium respectively, 3.78 mm for the bifurcation of the LM, and 1.82 mm, 2.10 mm and 1.89 mm for the origin of the right, non-coronary, and left aortic valve commissure respectively, demonstrating accurate performance. The proposed combination of regression and classification can be used to accurately detect landmarks in CCTA scans. 
### 338.An efficient deep convolutional laplacian pyramid architecture for CS  reconstruction at low sampling ratios [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04970.pdf)
> The compressed sensing (CS) has been successfully applied to image compression in the past few years as most image signals are sparse in a certain domain. Several CS reconstruction models have been proposed and obtained superior performance. However, these methods suffer from blocking artifacts or ringing effects at low sampling ratios in most cases. To address this problem, we propose a deep convolutional Laplacian Pyramid Compressed Sensing Network (LapCSNet) for CS, which consists of a sampling sub-network and a reconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, we utilize a convolutional layer to mimic the sampling operator. In contrast to the fixed sampling matrices used in traditional CS methods, the filters used in our convolutional layer are jointly optimized with the reconstruction sub-network. In the reconstruction sub-network, two branches are designed to reconstruct multi-scale residual images and muti-scale target images progressively using a Laplacian pyramid architecture. The proposed LapCSNet not only integrates multi-scale information to achieve better performance but also reduces computational cost dramatically. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of reconstructing more details and sharper edges against the state-of-the-arts methods. 
### 339.Convolutional Neural Networks for Skull-stripping in Brain MR Imaging  using Consensus-based Silver standard Masks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04988.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for medical imaging are constrained by the number of annotated data required in the training stage. Usually, manual annotation is considered to be the "gold standard". However, medical imaging datasets that include expert manual segmentation are scarce as this step is time-consuming, and therefore expensive. Moreover, single-rater manual annotation is most often used in data-driven approaches making the network optimal with respect to only that single expert. In this work, we propose a CNN for brain extraction in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, that is fully trained with what we refer to as silver standard masks. Our method consists of 1) developing a dataset with "silver standard" masks as input, and implementing both 2) a tri-planar method using parallel 2D U-Net-based CNNs (referred to as CONSNet) and 3) an auto-context implementation of CONSNet. The term CONSNet refers to our integrated approach, i.e., training with silver standard masks and using a 2D U-Net-based architecture. Our results showed that we outperformed (i.e., larger Dice coefficients) the current state-of-the-art SS methods. Our use of silver standard masks reduced the cost of manual annotation, decreased inter-intra-rater variability, and avoided CNN segmentation super-specialization towards one specific manual annotation guideline that can occur when gold standard masks are used. Moreover, the usage of silver standard masks greatly enlarges the volume of input annotated data because we can relatively easily generate labels for unlabeled data. In addition, our method has the advantage that, once trained, it takes only a few seconds to process a typical brain image volume using modern hardware, such as a high-end graphics processing unit. In contrast, many of the other competitive methods have processing times in the order of minutes. 
### 340.Comparatives, Quantifiers, Proportions: A Multi-Task Model for the  Learning of Quantities from Vision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05018.pdf)
> The present work investigates whether different quantification mechanisms (set comparison, vague quantification, and proportional estimation) can be jointly learned from visual scenes by a multi-task computational model. The motivation is that, in humans, these processes underlie the same cognitive, non-symbolic ability, which allows an automatic estimation and comparison of set magnitudes. We show that when information about lower-complexity tasks is available, the higher-level proportional task becomes more accurate than when performed in isolation. Moreover, the multi-task model is able to generalize to unseen combinations of target/non-target objects. Consistently with behavioral evidence showing the interference of absolute number in the proportional task, the multi-task model no longer works when asked to provide the number of target objects in the scene. 
### 341.Unsupervised Sparse Dirichlet-Net for Hyperspectral Image  Super-Resolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05042.pdf)
> In many computer vision applications, obtaining images of high resolution in both the spatial and spectral domains are equally important. However, due to hardware limitations, one can only expect to acquire images of high resolution in either the spatial or spectral domains. This paper focuses on hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSI-SR), where a hyperspectral image (HSI) with low spatial resolution (LR) but high spectral resolution is fused with a multispectral image (MSI) with high spatial resolution (HR) but low spectral resolution to obtain HR HSI. Existing deep learning-based solutions are all supervised that would need a large training set and the availability of HR HSI, which is unrealistic. Here, we make the first attempt to solving the HSI-SR problem using an unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture that carries the following uniquenesses. First, it is composed of two encoder-decoder networks, coupled through a shared decoder, in order to preserve the rich spectral information from the HSI network. Second, the network encourages the representations from both modalities to follow a sparse Dirichlet distribution which naturally incorporates the two physical constraints of HSI and MSI. Third, the angular difference between representations are minimized in order to reduce the spectral distortion. We refer to the proposed architecture as unsupervised Sparse Dirichlet-Net, or uSDN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of uSDN as compared to the state-of-the-art. 
### 342.I-HAZE: a dehazing benchmark with real hazy and haze-free indoor images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05091.pdf)
> Image dehazing has become an important computational imaging topic in the recent years. However, due to the lack of ground truth images, the comparison of dehazing methods is not straightforward, nor objective. To overcome this issue we introduce a new dataset -named I-HAZE- that contains 35 image pairs of hazy and corresponding haze-free (ground-truth) indoor images. Different from most of the existing dehazing databases, hazy images have been generated using real haze produced by a professional haze machine. For easy color calibration and improved assessment of dehazing algorithms, each scene include a MacBeth color checker. Moreover, since the images are captured in a controlled environment, both haze-free and hazy images are captured under the same illumination conditions. This represents an important advantage of the I-HAZE dataset that allows us to objectively compare the existing image dehazing techniques using traditional image quality metrics such as PSNR and SSIM. 
### 343.O-HAZE: a dehazing benchmark with real hazy and haze-free outdoor images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05101.pdf)
> Haze removal or dehazing is a challenging ill-posed problem that has drawn a significant attention in the last few years. Despite this growing interest, the scientific community is still lacking a reference dataset to evaluate objectively and quantitatively the performance of proposed dehazing methods. The few datasets that are currently considered, both for assessment and training of learning-based dehazing techniques, exclusively rely on synthetic hazy images. To address this limitation, we introduce the first outdoor scenes database (named O-HAZE) composed of pairs of real hazy and corresponding haze-free images. In practice, hazy images have been captured in presence of real haze, generated by professional haze machines, and OHAZE contains 45 different outdoor scenes depicting the same visual content recorded in haze-free and hazy conditions, under the same illumination parameters. To illustrate its usefulness, O-HAZE is used to compare a representative set of state-of-the-art dehazing techniques, using traditional image quality metrics such as PSNR, SSIM and CIEDE2000. This reveals the limitations of current techniques, and questions some of their underlying assumptions. 
### 344.Text-to-Clip Video Retrieval with Early Fusion and Re-Captioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05113.pdf)
> We propose a novel method capable of retrieving clips from untrimmed videos based on natural language queries. This cross-modal retrieval task plays a key role in visual-semantic understanding, and requires localizing clips in time and computing their similarity to the query sentence. Current methods generate sentence and video embeddings and then compare them using a late fusion approach, but this ignores the word order in queries and prevents more fine-grained comparisons. Motivated by the need for fine-grained multi-modal feature fusion, we propose a novel early fusion embedding approach that combines video and language information at the word level. Furthermore, we use the inverse task of dense video captioning as a side-task to improve the learned embedding. Our full model combines these components with an efficient proposal pipeline that performs accurate localization of potential video clips. We present a comprehensive experimental validation on two large-scale text-to-clip datasets (Charades-STA and DiDeMo) and attain state-of-the-art retrieval results with our model. 
### 345.HyperFusion-Net: Densely Reflective Fusion for Salient Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05142.pdf)
> Salient object detection (SOD), which aims to find the most important region of interest and segment the relevant object/item in that area, is an important yet challenging vision task. This problem is inspired by the fact that human seems to perceive main scene elements with high priorities. Thus, accurate detection of salient objects in complex scenes is critical for human-computer interaction. In this paper, we present a novel feature learning framework for SOD, in which we cast the SOD as a pixel-wise classification problem. The proposed framework utilizes a densely hierarchical feature fusion network, named HyperFusion-Net, automatically predicts the most important area and segments the associated objects in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, inspired by the human perception system and image reflection separation, we first decompose input images into reflective image pairs by content-preserving transforms. Then, the complementary information of reflective image pairs is jointly extracted by an interweaved convolutional neural network (ICNN) and hierarchically combined with a hyper-dense fusion mechanism. Based on the fused multi-scale features, our method finally achieves a promising way of predicting SOD. As shown in our extensive experiments, the proposed method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on seven public datasets with a large margin. 
### 346.Road Segmentation Using CNN with GRU [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05164.pdf)
> This paper presents an accurate and fast algorithm for road segmentation using convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent units (GRU). For autonomous vehicles, road segmentation is a fundamental task that can provide the drivable area for path planning. The existing deep neural network based segmentation algorithms usually take a very deep encoder-decoder structure to fuse pixels, which requires heavy computations, large memory and long processing time. Hereby, a CNN-GRU network model is proposed and trained to perform road segmentation using data captured by the front camera of a vehicle. GRU network obtains a long spatial sequence with lower computational complexity, comparing to traditional encoder-decoder architecture. The proposed road detector is evaluated on the KITTI road benchmark and achieves high accuracy for road segmentation at real-time processing speed. 
### 347.LiDAR and Camera Calibration using Motion Estimated by Sensor Fusion  Odometry [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05178.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a method of targetless and automatic Camera-LiDAR calibration. Our approach is an extension of hand-eye calibration framework to 2D-3D calibration. By using the sensor fusion odometry method, the scaled camera motions are calculated with high accuracy. In addition to this, we clarify the suitable motion for this calibration method. <br />The proposed method only requires the three-dimensional point cloud and the camera image and does not need other information such as reflectance of LiDAR and to give initial extrinsic parameter. In the experiments, we demonstrate our method using several sensor configurations in indoor and outdoor scenes to verify the effectiveness. The accuracy of our method achieves more than other comparable state-of-the-art methods. 
### 348.Select, Attend, and Transfer: Light, Learnable Skip Connections [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05181.pdf)
> Skip connections in deep networks have improved both segmentation and classification performance by facilitating the training of deeper network architectures, and reducing the risks for vanishing gradients. They equip encoder-decoder-like networks with richer feature representations, but at the cost of higher memory usage, computation, and possibly resulting in transferring non-discriminative feature maps. In this paper, we focus on improving skip connections used in segmentation networks (e.g., U-Net, V-Net, and The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu (DensNet) architectures). We propose light, learnable skip connections which learn to first select the most discriminative channels and then attend to the most discriminative regions of the selected feature maps. The output of the proposed skip connections is a unique feature map which not only reduces the memory usage and network parameters to a high extent, but also improves segmentation accuracy. We evaluate the proposed method on three different 2D and volumetric datasets and demonstrate that the proposed light, learnable skip connections can outperform the traditional heavy skip connections in terms of segmentation accuracy, memory usage, and number of network parameters. 
### 349.Beyond Trade-off: Accelerate FCN-based Face Detector with Higher  Accuracy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05197.pdf)
> Fully convolutional neural network (FCN) has been dominating the game of face detection task for a few years with its congenital capability of sliding-window-searching with shared kernels, which boiled down all the redundant calculation, and most recent state-of-the-art methods such as Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLO and FPN use FCN as their backbone. So here comes one question: Can we find a universal strategy to further accelerate FCN with higher accuracy, so could accelerate all the recent FCN-based methods? To analyze this, we decompose the face searching space into two orthogonal directions, `scale' and `spatial'. Only a few coordinates in the space expanded by the two base vectors indicate foreground. So if FCN could ignore most of the other points, the searching space and false alarm should be significantly boiled down. Based on this philosophy, a novel method named scale estimation and spatial attention proposal ($S^2AP$) is proposed to pay attention to some specific scales and valid locations in the image pyramid. Furthermore, we adopt a masked-convolution operation based on the attention result to accelerate FCN calculation. Experiments show that FCN-based method RPN can be accelerated by about $4\times$ with the help of $S^2AP$ and masked-FCN and at the same time it can also achieve the state-of-the-art on FDDB, AFW and MALF face detection benchmarks as well. 
### 350.Physics-driven Fire Modeling from Multi-view Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05261.pdf)
> Fire effects are widely used in various computer graphics applications such as visual effects and video games. Modeling the shape and appearance of fire phenomenon is challenging as the underlying effects are driven by complex laws of physics. State-of-the-art fire modeling techniques rely on sophisticated physical simulations which require intensive parameter tuning, or use simplifications which produce physically invalid results. In this paper, we present a novel method of reconstructing physically valid fire models from multi-view stereo images. Our method, for the first time, provides plausible estimation of physical properties (e.g., temperature, density) of a fire volume using RGB cameras. This allows for a number of novel phenomena such as global fire illumination effects. The effectiveness and usefulness of our method are tested by generating fire models from a variety of input data, and applying the reconstructed fire models for realistic illumination of virtual scenes. 
### 351.Fusion of hyperspectral and ground penetrating radar to estimate soil  moisture [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05273.pdf)
> In this contribution, we investigate the potential of hyperspectral data combined with either simulated ground penetrating radar (GPR) or simulated (sensor-like) soil-moisture data to estimate soil moisture. We propose two simulation approaches to extend a given multi-sensor dataset which contains sparse GPR data. In the first approach, simulated GPR data is generated either by an interpolation along the time axis or by a machine learning model. The second approach includes the simulation of soil-moisture along the GPR profile. The soil-moisture estimation is improved significantly by the fusion of hyperspectral and GPR data. In contrast, the combination of simulated, sensor-like soil-moisture values and hyperspectral data achieves the worst regression performance. In conclusion, the estimation of soil moisture with hyperspectral and GPR data engages further investigations. 
### 352.Horizontal Pyramid Matching for Person Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05275.pdf)
> Despite the remarkable recent progress, person Re-identification (Re-ID) approaches are still suffering from the failure cases where the discriminative body parts are missing. To mitigate such cases, we propose a simple yet effective Horizontal Pyramid Matching (HPM) approach to fully exploit various partial information of a given person, so that correct person candidates can be still identified even if some key parts are missing. Within the HPM, we make the following contributions to produce a more robust feature representation for the Re-ID task: 1) we learn to classify using partial feature representations at different horizontal pyramid scales, which successfully enhance the discriminative capabilities of various person parts; 2) we exploit average and max pooling strategies to account for person-specific discriminative information in a global-local manner; 3) we introduce a novel horizontal erasing operation during training to further resist the problem of missing parts and boost the robustness of feature representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular benchmarks including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03. We achieve mAP scores of 83.1%, 74.5% and 59.7% on these benchmarks, which are the new state-of-the-arts. 
### 353.On the Selection of Anchors and Targets for Video Hyperlinking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05286.pdf)
> A problem not well understood in video hyperlinking is what qualifies a fragment as an anchor or target. Ideally, anchors provide good starting points for navigation, and targets supplement anchors with additional details while not distracting users with irrelevant, false and redundant information. The problem is not trivial for intertwining relationship between data characteristics and user expectation. Imagine that in a large dataset, there are clusters of fragments spreading over the feature space. The nature of each cluster can be described by its size (implying popularity) and structure (implying complexity). A principle way of hyperlinking can be carried out by picking centers of clusters as anchors and from there reach out to targets within or outside of clusters with consideration of neighborhood complexity. The question is which fragments should be selected either as anchors or targets, in one way to reflect the rich content of a dataset, and meanwhile to minimize the risk of frustrating user experience. This paper provides some insights to this question from the perspective of hubness and local intrinsic dimensionality, which are two statistical properties in assessing the popularity and complexity of data space. Based these properties, two novel algorithms are proposed for low-risk automatic selection of anchors and targets. 
### 354.Video2Shop: Exactly Matching Clothes in Videos to Online Shopping Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05287.pdf)
> In recent years, both online retail and video hosting service are exponentially growing. In this paper, we explore a new cross-domain task, Video2Shop, targeting for matching clothes appeared in videos to the exact same items in online shops. A novel deep neural network, called AsymNet, is proposed to explore this problem. For the image side, well- established methods are used to detect and extract features for clothing patches with arbitrary sizes. For the video side, deep visual features are extracted from detected object re- gions in each frame, and further fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework for sequence modeling, which captures the temporal dynamics in videos. To conduct exact matching between videos and online shopping images, LSTM hidden states, representing the video, and image features, which represent static object images, are jointly mod- eled under the similarity network with reconfigurable deep tree structure. Moreover, an approximate training method is proposed to achieve the efficiency when training. Extensive experiments conducted on a large cross-domain dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed AsymNet, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 355.Semantic Feature Augmentation in Few-shot Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05298.pdf)
> A fundamental problem with few-shot learning is the scarcity of data in training. A natural solution to alleviate this scarcity is to augment the existing images for each training class. However, directly augmenting samples in image space may not necessarily, nor sufficiently, explore the intra-class variation. To this end, we propose to directly synthesize instance features by leveraging the semantics of each class. Essentially, a novel auto-encoder network dual TriNet, is proposed for feature augmentation. The encoder TriNet projects multi-layer visual features of deep CNNs into the semantic space. In this space, data augmentation is induced, and the augmented instance representation is projected back into the image feature spaces by the decoder TriNet. Two data argumentation strategies in the semantic space are explored; notably these seemingly simple augmentations in semantic space result in complex augmented feature distributions in the image feature space, resulting in substantially better performance. The code and models of our paper will be published on: <a href="https://github.com/tankche1/Semantic-Feature-Augmentation-in-Few-shot-Learning.">this https URL</a> 
### 356.Local Descriptors Optimized for Average Precision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05312.pdf)
> Extraction of local feature descriptors is a vital stage in the solution pipelines for numerous computer vision tasks. Learning-based approaches improve performance in certain tasks, but still cannot replace handcrafted features in general. In this paper, we improve the learning of local feature descriptors by optimizing the performance of descriptor matching, which is a common stage that follows descriptor extraction in local feature based pipelines, and can be formulated as nearest neighbor retrieval. Specifically, we directly optimize a ranking-based retrieval performance metric, Average Precision, using deep neural networks. This general-purpose solution can also be viewed as a listwise learning to rank approach, which is advantageous compared to recent local ranking approaches. On standard benchmarks, descriptors learned with our formulation achieve state-of-the-art results in patch verification, patch retrieval, and image matching. 
### 357.Attention-Gated Networks for Improving Ultrasound Scan Plane Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05338.pdf)
> In this work, we apply an attention-gated network to real-time automated scan plane detection for fetal ultrasound screening. Scan plane detection in fetal ultrasound is a challenging problem due the poor image quality resulting in low interpretability for both clinicians and automated algorithms. To solve this, we propose incorporating self-gated soft-attention mechanisms. A soft-attention mechanism generates a gating signal that is end-to-end trainable, which allows the network to contextualise local information useful for prediction. The proposed attention mechanism is generic and it can be easily incorporated into any existing classification architectures, while only requiring a few additional parameters. We show that, when the base network has a high capacity, the incorporated attention mechanism can provide efficient object localisation while improving the overall performance. When the base network has a low capacity, the method greatly outperforms the baseline approach and significantly reduces false positives. Lastly, the generated attention maps allow us to understand the model's reasoning process, which can also be used for weakly supervised object localisation. 
### 358.SparseNet: A Sparse DenseNet for Image Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05340.pdf)
> Deep neural networks have made remarkable progresses on various computer vision tasks. Recent works have shown that depth, width and shortcut connections of networks are all vital to their performances. In this paper, we introduce a method to sparsify DenseNet which can reduce connections of a L-layer DenseNet from O(L^2) to O(L), and thus we can simultaneously increase depth, width and connections of neural networks in a more parameter-efficient and computation-efficient way. Moreover, an attention module is introduced to further boost our network's performance. We denote our network as SparseNet. We evaluate SparseNet on datasets of CIFAR(including CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and SVHN. Experiments show that SparseNet can obtain improvements over the state-of-the-art on CIFAR10 and SVHN. Furthermore, while achieving comparable performances as DenseNet on these datasets, SparseNet is x2.6 smaller and x3.7 faster than the original DenseNet. 
### 359.A Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization Framework for Identifying  Functional Units of Tongue Behavior from MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05370.pdf)
> Muscle coordination patterns of lingual behaviors are synergies generated by deforming local muscle groups in a variety of ways. Functional units are functional muscle groups of local structural elements within the tongue that compress, expand, and move in a cohesive and consistent manner. Identifying the functional units using tagged-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sheds light on the mechanisms of normal and pathological muscle coordination patterns, yielding improvement in surgical planning, treatment, or rehabilitation procedures. Here, to mine this information, we propose a matrix factorization and probabilistic graphical model framework to produce building blocks and their associated weighting map using motion quantities extracted from tagged-MRI. Our tagged-MRI imaging and 4D (3D space with time) voxel-level tracking provide previously unavailable internal tongue motion patterns, thus revealing the inner workings of the tongue during speech or other lingual behaviors. We then employ spectral clustering on the weighting map to identify the cohesive regions defined by the tongue motion that may involve multiple or undocumented regions. To evaluate our method, we perform a series of experiments. We first use two-dimensional image and synthetic data to demonstrate the accuracy of our method. We then use three-dimensional synthetic and in vivo tongue motion data using protrusion and simple speech tasks to identify subject-specific and data-driven functional units of the tongue in localized regions. 
### 360.FDMO: Feature Assisted Direct Monocular Odometry [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05422.pdf)
> Visual Odometry (VO) can be categorized as being either direct or feature based. When the system is calibrated photometrically, and images are captured at high rates, direct methods have shown to outperform feature-based ones in terms of accuracy and processing time; they are also more robust to failure in feature-deprived environments. On the downside, Direct methods rely on heuristic motion models to seed the estimation of camera motion between frames; in the event that these models are violated (e.g., erratic motion), Direct methods easily fail. This paper proposes a novel system entitled FDMO (Feature assisted Direct Monocular Odometry), which complements the advantages of both direct and featured based techniques. FDMO bootstraps indirect feature tracking upon the sub-pixel accurate localized direct keyframes only when failure modes (e.g., large baselines) of direct tracking occur. Control returns back to direct odometry when these conditions are no longer violated. Efficiencies are introduced to help FDMO perform in real time. FDMO shows significant drift (alignment, rotation &amp; scale) reduction when compared to DSO &amp; ORB SLAM when evaluated using the TumMono and EuroC datasets. 
### 361.White matter fiber analysis using kernel dictionary learning and  sparsity priors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05427.pdf)
> Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, a non-invasive tool to infer white matter fiber connections, produces a large number of streamlines containing a wealth of information on structural connectivity. The size of these tractography outputs makes further analyses complex, creating a need for methods to group streamlines into meaningful bundles. In this work, we address this by proposing a set of kernel dictionary learning and sparsity priors based methods. Proposed frameworks include L-0 norm, group sparsity, as well as manifold regularization prior. The proposed methods allow streamlines to be assigned to more than one bundle, making it more robust to overlapping bundles and inter-subject variations. We evaluate the performance of our method on a labeled set and data from Human Connectome Project. Results highlight the ability of our method to group streamlines into plausible bundles and illustrate the impact of sparsity priors on the performance of the proposed methods. 
### 362.Comparative study of motion detection methods for video surveillance  systems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05459.pdf)
> The objective of this study is to compare several change detection methods for a mono static camera and identify the best method for different complex environments and backgrounds in indoor and outdoor scenes. To this end, we used the CDnet video dataset as a benchmark that consists of many challenging problems, ranging from basic simple scenes to complex scenes affected by bad weather and dynamic backgrounds. Twelve change detection methods, ranging from simple temporal differencing to more sophisticated methods, were tested and several performance metrics were used to precisely evaluate the results. Because most of the considered methods have not previously been evaluated on this recent large scale dataset, this work compares these methods to fill a lack in the literature, and thus this evaluation joins as complementary compared with the previous comparative evaluations. Our experimental results show that there is no perfect method for all challenging cases, each method performs well in certain cases and fails in others. However, this study enables the user to identify the most suitable method for his or her needs. 
### 363.Im2Struct: Recovering 3D Shape Structure from a Single RGB Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05469.pdf)
> We propose to recover 3D shape structures from single RGB images, where structure refers to shape parts represented by cuboids and part relations encompassing connectivity and symmetry. Given a single 2D image with an object depicted, our goal is automatically recover a cuboid structure of the object parts as well as their mutual relations. We develop a convolutional-recursive auto-encoder comprised of structure parsing of a 2D image followed by structure recovering of a cuboid hierarchy. The encoder is achieved by a multi-scale convolutional network trained with the task of shape contour estimation, thereby learning to discern object structures in various forms and scales. The decoder fuses the features of the structure parsing network and the original image, and recursively decodes a hierarchy of cuboids. Since the decoder network is learned to recover part relations including connectivity and symmetry explicitly, the plausibility and generality of part structure recovery can be ensured. The two networks are jointly trained using the training data of contour-mask and cuboid structure pairs. Such pairs are generated by rendering stock 3D CAD models coming with part segmentation. Our method achieves unprecedentedly faithful and detailed recovery of diverse 3D part structures from single-view 2D images. We demonstrate two applications of our method including structure-guided completion of 3D volumes reconstructed from single-view images and structure-aware interactive editing of 2D images. 
### 364.Optimizing Video Object Detection via a Scale-Time Lattice [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05472.pdf)
> High-performance object detection relies on expensive convolutional networks to compute features, often leading to significant challenges in applications, e.g. those that require detecting objects from video streams in real time. The key to this problem is to trade accuracy for efficiency in an effective way, i.e. reducing the computing cost while maintaining competitive performance. To seek a good balance, previous efforts usually focus on optimizing the model architectures. This paper explores an alternative approach, that is, to reallocate the computation over a scale-time space. The basic idea is to perform expensive detection sparsely and propagate the results across both scales and time with substantially cheaper networks, by exploiting the strong correlations among them. Specifically, we present a unified framework that integrates detection, temporal propagation, and across-scale refinement on a Scale-Time Lattice. On this framework, one can explore various strategies to balance performance and cost. Taking advantage of this flexibility, we further develop an adaptive scheme with the detector invoked on demand and thus obtain improved tradeoff. On ImageNet VID dataset, the proposed method can achieve a competitive mAP 79.6% at 20 fps, or 79.0% at 62 fps as a performance/speed tradeoff. 
### 365.Review on Optical Image Hiding and Watermarking Techniques [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05483.pdf)
> Information security is a critical issue in modern society and image watermarking can effectively prevent unauthorized information access. Optical image watermarking techniques generally have advantages of parallel high-speed processing and multi-dimensional capabilities compared with digital approaches. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the research works related to optical image hiding and watermarking techniques conducted in the past decade. The past research works are focused on two major aspects, various optical systems for image hiding and the methods for embedding optical system output into a host image. A summary of the state-of-the-art works is made from these two perspectives. 
### 366.Multi-modality Sensor Data Classification with Selective Attention [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05493.pdf)
> Multimodal wearable sensor data classification plays an important role in ubiquitous computing and has a wide range of applications in scenarios from healthcare to entertainment. However, most existing work in this field employs domain-specific approaches and is thus ineffective in complex sit- uations where multi-modality sensor data are col- lected. Moreover, the wearable sensor data are less informative than the conventional data such as texts or images. In this paper, to improve the adapt- ability of such classification methods across differ- ent application domains, we turn this classification task into a game and apply a deep reinforcement learning scheme to deal with complex situations dynamically. Additionally, we introduce a selective attention mechanism into the reinforcement learn- ing scheme to focus on the crucial dimensions of the data. This mechanism helps to capture extra information from the signal and thus it is able to significantly improve the discriminative power of the classifier. We carry out several experiments on three wearable sensor datasets and demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed approach compared to several state-of-the-art baselines. 
### 367.Learning Simple Thresholded Features with Sparse Support Recovery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05515.pdf)
> The thresholded feature has recently emerged as an extremely efficient, yet rough empirical approximation, of the time-consuming sparse coding inference process. Such an approximation has not yet been rigorously examined, and standard dictionaries often lead to non-optimal performance when used for computing thresholded features. In this paper, we first present two theoretical recovery guarantees for the thresholded feature to exactly recover the nonzero support of the sparse code. Motivated by them, we then formulate the Dictionary Learning for Thresholded Features (DLTF) model, which learns an optimized dictionary for applying the thresholded feature. In particular, for the $(k, 2)$ norm involved, a novel proximal operator with log-linear time complexity $O(m\log m)$ is derived. We evaluate the performance of DLTF on a vast range of synthetic and real-data tasks, where DLTF demonstrates remarkable efficiency, effectiveness and robustness in all experiments. In addition, we briefly discuss the potential link between DLTF and deep learning building blocks. 
### 368.A Novel Low-cost FPGA-based Real-time Object Tracking System [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05535.pdf)
> In current visual object tracking system, the CPU or GPU-based visual object tracking systems have high computational cost and consume a prohibitive amount of power. Therefore, in this paper, to reduce the computational burden of the Camshift algorithm, we propose a novel visual object tracking algorithm by exploiting the properties of the binary classifier and Kalman predictor. Moreover, we present a low-cost FPGA-based real-time object tracking hardware architecture. Extensive evaluations on OTB benchmark demonstrate that the proposed system has extremely compelling real-time, stability and robustness. The evaluation results show that the accuracy of our algorithm is about 48%, and the average speed is about 309 frames per second. 
### 369.A Novel Parallel Ray-Casting Algorithm [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05541.pdf)
> The Ray-Casting algorithm is an important method for fast real-time surface display from 3D medical images. Based on the Ray-Casting algorithm, a novel parallel Ray-Casting algorithm is proposed in this paper. A novel operation is introduced and defined as a star operation, and star operations can be computed in parallel in the proposed algorithm compared with the serial chain of star operations in the Ray-Casting algorithm. The computation complexity of the proposed algorithm is reduced from $O(n)$ to $O(\log^n_2)$. 
### 370.Particle-based pedestrian path prediction using LSTM-MDL models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05546.pdf)
> Recurrent neural networks are able to learn complex long-term relationships from sequential data and output a pdf over the state space. Therefore, recurrent models are a natural choice to address path prediction tasks, where a trained model is used to generate future expectations from past observations. When applied to security applications, like predicting the path of pedestrians for risk assessment, a point-wise greedy (ML) evaluation of the output pdf is not feasible, since the environment often allows multiple choices. Therefore, a robust risk assessment has to take all options into account, even if they are overall not very likely. <br />Towards this end, a combination of particle filter sampling strategies and a LSTM-MDL model is proposed to address a multi-modal path prediction task. The capabilities and viability of the proposed approach are evaluated on several synthetic test conditions, yielding the counter-intuitive result that the simplest approach performs best. Further, the feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated on several real world scenes. 
### 371.Semantic Single-Image Dehazing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05624.pdf)
> Single-image haze-removal is challenging due to limited information contained in one single image. Previous solutions largely rely on handcrafted priors to compensate for this deficiency. Recent convolutional neural network (CNN) models have been used to learn haze-related priors but they ultimately work as advanced image filters. In this paper we propose a novel semantic ap- proach towards single image haze removal. Unlike existing methods, we infer color priors based on extracted semantic features. We argue that semantic context can be exploited to give informative cues for (a) learning color prior on clean image and (b) estimating ambient illumination. This design allowed our model to recover clean images from challenging cases with strong ambiguity, e.g. saturated illumination color and sky regions in image. In experiments, we validate our ap- proach upon synthetic and real hazy images, where our method showed superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches, suggesting semantic information facilitates the haze removal task. 
### 372.Direct Sparse Visual-Inertial Odometry using Dynamic Marginalization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05625.pdf)
> We present VI-DSO, a novel approach for visual-inertial odometry, which jointly estimates camera poses and sparse scene geometry by minimizing photometric and IMU measurement errors in a combined energy functional. The visual part of the system performs a bundle-adjustment like optimization on a sparse set of points, but unlike key-point based systems it directly minimizes a photometric error. This makes it possible for the system to track not only corners, but any pixels with large enough intensity gradients. IMU information is accumulated between several frames using measurement preintegration, and is inserted into the optimization as an additional constraint between keyframes. We explicitly include scale and gravity direction into our model and jointly optimize them together with other variables such as poses. As the scale is often not immediately observable using IMU data this allows us to initialize our visual-inertial system with an arbitrary scale instead of having to delay the initialization until everything is observable. We perform partial marginalization of old variables so that updates can be computed in a reasonable time. In order to keep the system consistent we propose a novel strategy which we call "dynamic marginalization". This technique allows us to use partial marginalization even in cases where the initial scale estimate is far from the optimum. We evaluate our method on the challenging EuRoC dataset, showing that VI-DSO outperforms the state of the art. 
### 373.IterGANs: Iterative GANs to Learn and Control 3D Object Transformation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05651.pdf)
> We are interested in learning visual representations which allow for 3D manipulations of visual objects based on a single 2D image. We cast this into an image-to-image transformation task, and propose Iterative Generative Adversarial Networks (IterGANs) which iteratively transform an input image into an output image. Our models learn a visual representation that can be used for objects seen in training, but also for never seen objects. Since object manipulation requires a full understanding of the geometry and appearance of the object, our IterGANs learn an implicit 3D model and a full appearance model of the object, which are both inferred from a single (test) image. Two advantages of IterGANs are that the intermediate generated images can be used for an additional supervision signal, even in an unsupervised fashion, and that the number of iterations can be used as a control signal to steer the transformation. Experiments on rotated objects and scenes show how IterGANs help with the generation process. 
### 374.Neural Kinematic Networks for Unsupervised Motion Retargetting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05653.pdf)
> We propose a recurrent neural network architecture with a Forward Kinematics layer and cycle consistency based adversarial training objective for unsupervised motion retargetting. Our network captures the high-level properties of an input motion by the forward kinematics layer, and adapts them to a target character with different skeleton bone lengths (e.g., shorter, longer arms etc.). Collecting paired motion training sequences from different characters is expensive. Instead, our network utilizes cycle consistency to learn to solve the Inverse Kinematics problem in an unsupervised manner. Our method works online, i.e., it adapts the motion sequence on-the-fly as new frames are received. In our experiments, we use the Mixamo animation data to test our method for a variety of motions and characters and achieve state-of-the-art results. We also demonstrate motion retargetting from monocular human videos to 3D characters using an off-the-shelf 3D pose estimator. 
### 375.An Online Writer Identification System based on Beta-Elliptic Model and  Fuzzy Elementary Perceptual Codes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05661.pdf)
> Actually, the ability to identify the documents authors provides more chances for using these documents for various purposes. In this paper, we present a new effective biometric writer identification system from online handwriting. The system consists of the preprocessing and the segmentation of online handwriting into a sequence of Beta strokes in a first step. Then, from each Beta stroke, we extract a set of static and dynamic features using four features extraction techniques based on the Beta Elliptic model and the Fuzzy Elementary Perceptual Codes. Next, all the segments which are composed of N consecutive Beta strokes are categorized into groups and subgroups according to their position and their geometric characteristics. Finally, Deep Neural Network are used for classification. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system achieves interesting results as compared to those of the existing writer identification systems on Latin and Arabic scripts. 
### 376.Training convolutional neural networks with megapixel images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05712.pdf)
> To train deep convolutional neural networks, the input data and the intermediate activations need to be kept in memory to calculate the gradient descent step. Given the limited memory available in the current generation accelerator cards, this limits the maximum dimensions of the input data. We demonstrate a method to train convolutional neural networks holding only parts of the image in memory while giving equivalent results. We quantitatively compare this new way of training convolutional neural networks with conventional training. In addition, as a proof of concept, we train a convolutional neural network with 64 megapixel images, which requires 97% less memory than the conventional approach. 
### 377.Classifying magnetic resonance image modalities with convolutional  neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05764.pdf)
> Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging allows the acquisition of images with different contrast properties depending on the acquisition protocol and the magnetic properties of tissues. Many MR brain image processing techniques, such as tissue segmentation, require multiple MR contrasts as inputs, and each contrast is treated differently. Thus it is advantageous to automate the identification of image contrasts for various purposes, such as facilitating image processing pipelines, and managing and maintaining large databases via content-based image retrieval (CBIR). Most automated CBIR techniques focus on a two-step process: extracting features from data and classifying the image based on these features. We present a novel 3D deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for MR image contrast classification. The proposed CNN automatically identifies the MR contrast of an input brain image volume. Specifically, we explored three classification problems: (1) identify T1-weighted (T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) contrasts, (2) identify pre vs post-contrast T1, (3) identify pre vs post-contrast FLAIR. A total of 3418 image volumes acquired from multiple sites and multiple scanners were used. To evaluate each task, the proposed model was trained on 2137 images and tested on the remaining 1281 images. Results showed that image volumes were correctly classified with 97.57% accuracy. 
### 378.Materials for Masses: SVBRDF Acquisition with a Single Mobile Phone  Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05790.pdf)
> We propose a material acquisition approach to recover the spatially-varying BRDF and normal map of a near-planar surface from a single image captured by a handheld mobile phone camera. Our method images the surface under arbitrary environment lighting with the flash turned on, thereby avoiding shadows while simultaneously capturing high-frequency specular highlights. We train a CNN to regress an SVBRDF and surface normals from this image. Our network is trained using a large-scale SVBRDF dataset and designed to incorporate physical insights for material estimation, including an in-network rendering layer to model appearance and a material classifier to provide additional supervision during training. We refine the results from the network using a dense CRF module whose terms are designed specifically for our task. The framework is trained end-to-end and produces high quality results for a variety of materials. We provide extensive ablation studies to evaluate our network on both synthetic and real data, while demonstrating significant improvements in comparisons with prior works. 
### 379.ShapeShifter: Robust Physical Adversarial Attack on Faster R-CNN Object  Detector [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05810.pdf)
> Given the ability to directly manipulate image pixels in the digital input space, an adversary can easily generate imperceptible perturbations to fool a Deep Neural Network (DNN) image classifier, as demonstrated in prior work. In this work, we propose ShapeShifter, an attack that tackles the more challenging problem of crafting physical adversarial perturbations to fool image-based object detectors like Faster R-CNN. Attacking an object detector is more difficult than attacking an image classifier, as it needs to mislead the classification results in multiple bounding boxes with different scales. Extending the digital attack to the physical world adds another layer of difficulty, because it requires the perturbation to be robust enough to survive real-world distortions due to different viewing distances and angles, lighting conditions, and camera limitations. We show that the Expectation over Transformation technique, which was originally proposed to enhance the robustness of adversarial perturbations in image classification, can be successfully adapted to the object detection setting. ShapeShifter can generate adversarially perturbed stop signs that are consistently mis-detected by Faster R-CNN as other objects, posing a potential threat to autonomous vehicles and other safety-critical computer vision systems. 
### 380.DCAN: Dual Channel-wise Alignment Networks for Unsupervised Scene  Adaptation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05827.pdf)
> Harvesting dense pixel-level annotations to train deep neural networks for semantic segmentation is extremely expensive and unwieldy at scale. While learning from synthetic data where labels are readily available sounds promising, performance degrades significantly when testing on novel realistic data due to domain discrepancies. We present Dual Channel-wise Alignment Networks (DCAN), a simple yet effective approach to reduce domain shift at both pixel-level and feature-level. Exploring statistics in each channel of CNN feature maps, our framework performs channel-wise feature alignment, which preserves spatial structures and semantic information, in both an image generator and a segmentation network. In particular, given an image from the source domain and unlabeled samples from the target domain, the generator synthesizes new images on-the-fly to resemble samples from the target domain in appearance and the segmentation network further refines high-level features before predicting semantic maps, both of which leverage feature statistics of sampled images from the target domain. Unlike much recent and concurrent work relying on adversarial training, our framework is lightweight and easy to train. Extensive experiments on adapting models trained on synthetic segmentation benchmarks to real urban scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. 
### 381.Towards High Performance Video Object Detection for Mobiles [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05830.pdf)
> Despite the recent success of video object detection on Desktop GPUs, its architecture is still far too heavy for mobiles. It is also unclear whether the key principles of sparse feature propagation and multi-frame feature aggregation apply at very limited computational resources. In this paper, we present a light weight network architecture for video object detection on mobiles. Light weight image object detector is applied on sparse key frames. A very small network, Light Flow, is designed for establishing correspondence across frames. A flow-guided GRU module is designed to effectively aggregate features on key frames. For non-key frames, sparse feature propagation is performed. The whole network can be trained end-to-end. The proposed system achieves 60.2% mAP score at speed of 25.6 fps on mobiles (e.g., HuaWei Mate 8). 
### 382.Egocentric 6-DoF Tracking of Small Handheld Objects [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05870.pdf)
> Virtual and augmented reality technologies have seen significant growth in the past few years. A key component of such systems is the ability to track the pose of head mounted displays and controllers in 3D space. We tackle the problem of efficient 6-DoF tracking of a handheld controller from egocentric camera perspectives. We collected the HMD Controller dataset which consist of over 540,000 stereo image pairs labelled with the full 6-DoF pose of the handheld controller. Our proposed SSD-AF-Stereo3D model achieves a mean average error of 33.5 millimeters in 3D keypoint prediction and is used in conjunction with an IMU sensor on the controller to enable 6-DoF tracking. We also present results on approaches for model based full 6-DoF tracking. All our models operate under the strict constraints of real time mobile CPU inference. 
### 383.M-PACT: Michigan Platform for Activity Classification in Tensorflow [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05879.pdf)
> Action classification is a widely known and popular task that offers an approach towards video understanding. The absence of an easy-to-use platform containing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models presents an issue for the community. Given that individual research code is not written with an end user in mind and in certain cases code is not released, even for published articles, the importance of a common unified platform capable of delivering results while removing the burden of developing an entire system cannot be overstated. To try and overcome these issues, we develop a tensorflow-based unified platform to abstract away unnecessary overheads in terms of an end-to-end pipeline setup in order to allow the user to quickly and easily prototype action classification models. With the use of a consistent coding style across different models and seamless data flow between various submodules, the platform lends itself to the quick generation of results on a wide range of SOTA methods across a variety of datasets. All of these features are made possible through the use of fully pre-defined training and testing blocks built on top of a small but powerful set of modular functions that handle asynchronous data loading, model initializations, metric calculations, saving and loading of checkpoints, and logging of results. The platform is geared towards easily creating models, with the minimum requirement being the definition of a network architecture and preprocessing steps from a large custom selection of layers and preprocessing functions. M-PACT currently houses four SOTA activity classification models which include, I3D, C3D, ResNet50+LSTM and TSN. The classification performance achieved by these models are, 43.86% for ResNet50+LSTM on HMDB51 while C3D and TSN achieve 93.66% and 85.25% on UCF101 respectively. 
### 384.Densely Connected High Order Residual Network for Single Frame Image  Super Resolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05902.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have been widely adopted for research on super resolution recently, however previous work focused mainly on stacking as many layers as possible in their model, in this paper, we present a new perspective regarding to image restoration problems that we can construct the neural network model reflecting the physical significance of the image restoration process, that is, embedding the a priori knowledge of image restoration directly into the structure of our neural network model, we employed a symmetric non-linear colorspace, the sigmoidal transfer, to replace traditional transfers such as, sRGB, Rec.709, which are asymmetric non-linear colorspaces, we also propose a "reuse plus patch" method to deal with super resolution of different scaling factors, our proposed methods and model show generally superior performance over previous work even though our model was only roughly trained and could still be underfitting the training set. 
### 385.Segmentation of both Diseased and Healthy Skin from Clinical Photographs  in a Primary Care Setting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05944.pdf)
> This work presents the first segmentation study of both diseased and healthy skin in standard camera photographs from a clinical environment. Challenges arise from varied lighting conditions, skin types, backgrounds, and pathological states. For study, 400 clinical photographs (with skin segmentation masks) representing various pathological states of skin are retrospectively collected from a primary care network. 100 images are used for training and fine-tuning, and 300 are used for evaluation. This distribution between training and test partitions is chosen to reflect the difficulty in amassing large quantities of labeled data in this domain. A deep learning approach is used, and 3 public segmentation datasets of healthy skin are collected to study the potential benefits of pre-training. Two variants of U-Net are evaluated: U-Net and Dense Residual U-Net. We find that Dense Residual U-Nets have a 7.8% improvement in Jaccard, compared to classical U-Net architectures (0.55 vs. 0.51 Jaccard), for direct transfer, where fine-tuning data is not utilized. However, U-Net outperforms Dense Residual U-Net for both direct training (0.83 vs. 0.80) and fine-tuning (0.89 vs. 0.88). The stark performance improvement with fine-tuning compared to direct transfer and direct training emphasizes both the need for adequate representative data of diseased skin, and the utility of other publicly available data sources for this task. 
### 386.A Fusion Framework for Camouflaged Moving Foreground Detection in the  Wavelet Domain [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05984.pdf)
> Detecting camouflaged moving foreground objects has been known to be difficult due to the similarity between the foreground objects and the background. Conventional methods cannot distinguish the foreground from background due to the small differences between them and thus suffer from under-detection of the camouflaged foreground objects. In this paper, we present a fusion framework to address this problem in the wavelet domain. We first show that the small differences in the image domain can be highlighted in certain wavelet bands. Then the likelihood of each wavelet coefficient being foreground is estimated by formulating foreground and background models for each wavelet band. The proposed framework effectively aggregates the likelihoods from different wavelet bands based on the characteristics of the wavelet transform. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed existing methods in detecting camouflaged foreground objects. Specifically, the average F-measure for the proposed algorithm was 0.87, compared to 0.71 to 0.8 for the other state-of-the-art methods. 
### 387.Geometry-aware Deep Network for Single-Image Novel View Synthesis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06008.pdf)
> This paper tackles the problem of novel view synthesis from a single image. In particular, we target real-world scenes with rich geometric structure, a challenging task due to the large appearance variations of such scenes and the lack of simple 3D models to represent them. Modern, learning-based approaches mostly focus on appearance to synthesize novel views and thus tend to generate predictions that are inconsistent with the underlying scene structure. By contrast, in this paper, we propose to exploit the 3D geometry of the scene to synthesize a novel view. Specifically, we approximate a real-world scene by a fixed number of planes, and learn to predict a set of homographies and their corresponding region masks to transform the input image into a novel view. To this end, we develop a new region-aware geometric transform network that performs these multiple tasks in a common framework. Our results on the outdoor KITTI and the indoor ScanNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our network in generating high quality synthetic views that respect the scene geometry, thus outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 388.DoubleFusion: Real-time Capture of Human Performances with Inner Body  Shapes from a Single Depth Sensor [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06023.pdf)
> We propose DoubleFusion, a new real-time system that combines volumetric dynamic reconstruction with data-driven template fitting to simultaneously reconstruct detailed geometry, non-rigid motion and the inner human body shape from a single depth camera. One of the key contributions of this method is a double layer representation consisting of a complete parametric body shape inside, and a gradually fused outer surface layer. A pre-defined node graph on the body surface parameterizes the non-rigid deformations near the body, and a free-form dynamically changing graph parameterizes the outer surface layer far from the body, which allows more general reconstruction. We further propose a joint motion tracking method based on the double layer representation to enable robust and fast motion tracking performance. Moreover, the inner body shape is optimized online and forced to fit inside the outer surface layer. Overall, our method enables increasingly denoised, detailed and complete surface reconstructions, fast motion tracking performance and plausible inner body shape reconstruction in real-time. In particular, experiments show improved fast motion tracking and loop closure performance on more challenging scenarios. 
### 389.Learning to Color from Language [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06026.pdf)
> Automatic colorization is the process of adding color to greyscale images. We condition this process on language, allowing end users to manipulate a colorized image by feeding in different captions. We present two different architectures for language-conditioned colorization, both of which produce more accurate and plausible colorizations than a language-agnostic version. Through this language-based framework, we can dramatically alter colorizations by manipulating descriptive color words in captions. 
### 390.Pixels, voxels, and views: A study of shape representations for single  view 3D object shape prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06032.pdf)
> The goal of this paper is to compare surface-based and volumetric 3D object shape representations, as well as viewer-centered and object-centered reference frames for single-view 3D shape prediction. We propose a new algorithm for predicting depth maps from multiple viewpoints, with a single depth or RGB image as input. By modifying the network and the way models are evaluated, we can directly compare the merits of voxels vs. surfaces and viewer-centered vs. object-centered for familiar vs. unfamiliar objects, as predicted from RGB or depth images. Among our findings, we show that surface-based methods outperform voxel representations for objects from novel classes and produce higher resolution outputs. We also find that using viewer-centered coordinates is advantageous for novel objects, while object-centered representations are better for more familiar objects. Interestingly, the coordinate frame significantly affects the shape representation learned, with object-centered placing more importance on implicitly recognizing the object category and viewer-centered producing shape representations with less dependence on category recognition. 
### 391.Real-Time Rotation-Invariant Face Detection with Progressive Calibration  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06039.pdf)
> Rotation-invariant face detection, i.e. detecting faces with arbitrary rotation-in-plane (RIP) angles, is widely required in unconstrained applications but still remains as a challenging task, due to the large variations of face appearances. Most existing methods compromise with speed or accuracy to handle the large RIP variations. To address this problem more efficiently, we propose Progressive Calibration Networks (PCN) to perform rotation-invariant face detection in a coarse-to-fine manner. PCN consists of three stages, each of which not only distinguishes the faces from non-faces, but also calibrates the RIP orientation of each face candidate to upright progressively. By dividing the calibration process into several progressive steps and only predicting coarse orientations in early stages, PCN can achieve precise and fast calibration. By performing binary classification of face vs. non-face with gradually decreasing RIP ranges, PCN can accurately detect faces with full $360^{\circ}$ RIP angles. Such designs lead to a real-time rotation-invariant face detector. The experiments on multi-oriented FDDB and a challenging subset of WIDER FACE containing rotated faces in the wild show that our PCN achieves quite promising performance. 
### 392.A Concatenated Residual Network for Image Deblurring [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06042.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based restoration methods have recently received considerable progress in low level vision tasks, e.g., denoising, supperresolution, inpainting. A plain CNN, however, fails in image deblurring due to the severe pixel superposition caused by blur degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel concatenated residual CNN for image deblurring. Driven by minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based discriminative learning, the solution to image deblurring is interestingly unfolded into a series of iterative residual components, and is analyzed to demonstrate the contribution of iterative residual deconvolution (IRD). Furthermore, IRD motivates us to take one step forward to design CNN for image deblurring. Specifically, a residual CNN unit is employed to substitute the residual iteration, and is then concatenated and finally integrated, resulting in concatenated residual convolutional network (CRCNet). The experimental results demonstrate that CRCNet can not only achieve better quantitative metrics but also recover more visually plausible texture details. 
### 393.Co-occurrence Feature Learning from Skeleton Data for Action Recognition  and Detection with Hierarchical Aggregation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06055.pdf)
> Skeleton-based human action recognition has recently drawn increasing attentions with the availability of large-scale skeleton datasets. The most crucial factors for this task lie in two aspects: the intra-frame representation for joint co-occurrences and the inter-frame representation for skeletons' temporal evolutions. In this paper we propose an end-to-end convolutional co-occurrence feature learning framework. The co-occurrence features are learned with a hierarchical methodology, in which different levels of contextual information are aggregated gradually. Firstly point-level information of each joint is encoded independently. Then they are assembled into semantic representation in both spatial and temporal domains. Specifically, we introduce a global spatial aggregation scheme, which is able to learn superior joint co-occurrence features over local aggregation. Besides, raw skeleton coordinates as well as their temporal difference are integrated with a two-stream paradigm. Experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms other state-of-the-arts on action recognition and detection benchmarks like NTU RGB+D, SBU Kinect Interaction and PKU-MMD. 
### 394.Improving Deep Binary Embedding Networks by Order-aware Reweighting of  Triplets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06061.pdf)
> In this paper, we focus on triplet-based deep binary embedding networks for image retrieval task. The triplet loss has been shown to be most effective for the ranking problem. However, most of the previous works treat the triplets equally or select the hard triplets based on the loss. Such strategies do not consider the order relations, which is important for retrieval task. To this end, we propose an order-aware reweighting method to effectively train the triplet-based deep networks, which up-weights the important triplets and down-weights the uninformative triplets. First, we present the order-aware weighting factors to indicate the importance of the triplets, which depend on the rank order of binary codes. Then, we reshape the triplet loss to the squared triplet loss such that the loss function will put more weights on the important triplets. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves significant performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. 
### 395.Cross-Domain Adversarial Auto-Encoder [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06078.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose the Cross-Domain Adversarial Auto-Encoder (CDAAE) to address the problem of cross-domain image inference, generation and transformation. We make the assumption that images from different domains share the same latent code space for content, while having separate latent code space for style. The proposed framework can map cross-domain data to a latent code vector consisting of a content part and a style part. The latent code vector is matched with a prior distribution so that we can generate meaningful samples from any part of the prior space. Consequently, given a sample of one domain, our framework can generate various samples of the other domain with the same content of the input. This makes the proposed framework different from the current work of cross-domain transformation. Besides, the proposed framework can be trained with both labeled and unlabeled data, which makes it also suitable for domain adaptation. Experimental results on data sets SVHN, MNIST and CASIA show the proposed framework achieved visually appealing performance for image generation task. Besides, we also demonstrate the proposed method achieved superior results for domain adaptation. Code of our experiments is available in <a href="https://github.com/luckycallor/CDAAE.">this https URL</a> 
### 396.Sparse Unsupervised Capsules Generalize Better [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06094.pdf)
> We show that unsupervised training of latent capsule layers using only the reconstruction loss, without masking to select the correct output class, causes a loss of equivariances and other desirable capsule qualities. This implies that supervised capsules networks can't be very deep. Unsupervised sparsening of latent capsule layer activity both restores these qualities and appears to generalize better than supervised masking, while potentially enabling deeper capsules networks. We train a sparse, unsupervised capsules network of similar geometry to Sabour et al (2017) on MNIST, and then test classification accuracy on affNIST using an SVM layer. Accuracy is improved from benchmark 79% to 90%. 
### 397.Human Motion Capture Using a Drone [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06112.pdf)
> Current motion capture (MoCap) systems generally require markers and multiple calibrated cameras, which can be used only in constrained environments. In this work we introduce a drone-based system for 3D human MoCap. The system only needs an autonomously flying drone with an on-board RGB camera and is usable in various indoor and outdoor environments. A reconstruction algorithm is developed to recover full-body motion from the video recorded by the drone. We argue that, besides the capability of tracking a moving subject, a flying drone also provides fast varying viewpoints, which is beneficial for motion reconstruction. We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system using our new DroCap dataset and also demonstrate its applicability for MoCap in the wild using a consumer drone. 
### 398.The TUM VI Benchmark for Evaluating Visual-Inertial Odometry [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06120.pdf)
> Visual odometry and SLAM methods have a large variety of applications in domains such as augmented reality or robotics. Complementing vision sensors with inertial measurements tremendously improves tracking accuracy and robustness, and thus has spawned large interest in the development of visual-inertial (VI) odometry approaches. In this paper, we propose the TUM VI benchmark, a novel dataset with a diverse set of sequences in different scenes for evaluating VI odometry. It provides camera images with 1024x1024 resolution at 20 Hz, high dynamic range and photometric calibration. An IMU measures accelerations and angular velocities on 3 axes at 200 Hz, while the cameras and IMU sensors are time-synchronized in hardware. For trajectory evaluation, we also provide accurate pose ground truth from a motion capture system at high frequency (120 Hz) at the start and end of the sequences which we accurately aligned with the camera and IMU measurements. The full dataset with raw and calibrated data is publicly available. We also evaluate state-of-the-art VI odometry approaches on our dataset. 
### 399.Automatic Assessment of Artistic Quality of Photos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06124.pdf)
> This paper proposes a technique to assess the aesthetic quality of photographs. The goal of the study is to predict whether a given photograph is captured by professional photographers, or by common people, based on a measurement of artistic quality of the photograph. We propose a Multi-Layer-Perceptron based system to analyze some low, mid and high level image features and find their effectiveness to measure artistic quality of the image and produce a measurement of the artistic quality of the image on a scale of 10. We validate the proposed system on a large dataset, containing images downloaded from the internet. The dataset contains some images captured by professional photographers and the rest of the images captured by common people. The proposed measurement of artistic quality of images provides higher value of photo quality for the images captured by professional photographers, compared to the values provided for the other images. 
### 400.IGCV$2$: Interleaved Structured Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06202.pdf)
> In this paper, we study the problem of designing efficient convolutional neural network architectures with the interest in eliminating the redundancy in convolution kernels. In addition to structured sparse kernels, low-rank kernels and the product of low-rank kernels, the product of structured sparse kernels, which is a framework for interpreting the recently-developed interleaved group convolutions (IGC) and its variants (e.g., Xception), has been attracting increasing interests. <br />Motivated by the observation that the convolutions contained in a group convolution in IGC can be further decomposed in the same manner, we present a modularized building block, {IGCV$2$:} interleaved structured sparse convolutions. It generalizes interleaved group convolutions, which is composed of two structured sparse kernels, to the product of more structured sparse kernels, further eliminating the redundancy. We present the complementary condition and the balance condition to guide the design of structured sparse kernels, obtaining a balance among three aspects: model size, computation complexity and classification accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage on the balance among these three aspects compared to interleaved group convolutions and Xception, and competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art architecture design methods.
