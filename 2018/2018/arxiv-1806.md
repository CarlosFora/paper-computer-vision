### 1.Imaging with SPADs and DMDs: Seeing through Diffraction-Photons [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00094.pdf)
> This paper addresses the problem of imaging in the presence of diffraction-photons. Diffraction-photons arise from the low contrast-ratio of DMDs ($\sim 1000: 1$), and very much degrade the quality of images captured by SPAD-based systems. <br />Herein, a joint illumination/deconvolution scheme is designed to overcome diffraction-photons, enabling the acquisition of intensity and depth images. Additionally, a proof-of-concept experiment is conducted to demonstrate the viability of the designed scheme. It is shown that by co-designing the illumination and deconvolution phases of imaging, one can substantially overcome diffraction-photons. 
### 2.Respond-CAM: Analyzing Deep Models for 3D Imaging Data by Visualizations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00102.pdf)
> The convolutional neural network (CNN) has become a powerful tool for various biomedical image analysis tasks, but there is a lack of visual explanation for the machinery of CNNs. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, Respond-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Respond-CAM), for making CNN-based models interpretable by visualizing input regions that are important for predictions, especially for biomedical 3D imaging data inputs. Our method uses the gradients of any target concept (e.g. the score of target class) that flows into a convolutional layer. The weighted feature maps are combined to produce a heatmap that highlights the important regions in the image for predicting the target concept. We prove a preferable sum-to-score property of the Respond-CAM and verify its significant improvement on 3D images from the current state-of-the-art approach. Our tests on Cellular Electron Cryo-Tomography 3D images show that Respond-CAM achieves superior performance on visualizing the CNNs with 3D biomedical images inputs, and is able to get reasonably good results on visualizing the CNNs with natural image inputs. The Respond-CAM is an efficient and reliable approach for visualizing the CNN machinery, and is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model families and image analysis tasks. 
### 3.MONET: Multiview Semi-supervised Keypoint via Epipolar Divergence [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00104.pdf)
> This paper presents MONET---an end-to-end semi-supervised learning framework for a pose detector using multiview image streams. What differentiates MONET from existing models is its capability of detecting general subjects including non-human species without a pre-trained model. A key challenge of such subjects lies in the limited availability of expert manual annotations, which often leads to a large bias in the detection model. We address this challenge by using the epipolar constraint embedded in the unlabeled data in two ways. First, given a set of the labeled data, the keypoint trajectories can be reliably reconstructed in 3D using multiview optical flows, resulting in considerable data augmentation in space and time from nearly exhaustive views. Second, the detection across views must geometrically agree with each other. We introduce a new measure of geometric consistency in keypoint distributions called epipolar divergence---a generalized distance from the epipolar lines to the corresponding keypoint distribution. Epipolar divergence characterizes when two view keypoint distributions produces zero reprojection error. We design a twin network that minimizes the epipolar divergence through stereo rectification that can significantly alleviate computational complexity and sampling aliasing in training. We demonstrate that our framework can localize customized keypoints of diverse species, e.g., humans, dogs, and monkeys. 
### 4.An Ideal Observer Model to Probe Human Visual Segmentation of Natural  Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00111.pdf)
> Visual segmentation is a key perceptual function that partitions visual space and allows for detection, recognition and discrimination of objects in complex environments. The processes underlying human segmentation of natural images are still poorly understood. Existing datasets rely on manual labeling that conflate perceptual, motor, and cognitive factors. In part, this is because we lack an ideal observer model of segmentation to guide constrained experiments. On the other hand, despite recent progress in machine learning, modern algorithms still fall short of human segmentation performance. Our goal here is two-fold (i) propose a model to probe human visual segmentation mechanisms and (ii) develop an efficient algorithm for image segmentation. To this aim, we propose a novel probabilistic generative model of visual segmentation that for the first time combines 1) knowledge about the sensitivity of neurons in the visual cortex to statistical regularities in natural images; and 2) non-parametric Bayesian priors over segmentation maps (ie partitions of the visual space). We provide an algorithm for learning and inference, validate it on synthetic data, and illustrate how the two components of our model improve segmentation of natural images. We then show that the posterior distribution over segmentations captures well the variability across human subjects, indicating that our model provides a viable approach to probe human visual segmentation. 
### 5.k-Space Deep Learning for Reference-free EPI Ghost Correction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00153.pdf)
> Nyquist ghost artifacts in EPI images are originated from phase mismatch between the even and odd echoes. However, conventional correction methods using reference scans often produce erroneous results especially in high-field MRI due to the non-linear and time-varying local magnetic field changes. Recently, it was shown that the problem of ghost correction can be transformed into k-space data interpolation problem that can be solved using the annihilating filter-based low-rank Hankel structured matrix completion approach (ALOHA). Another recent discovery has shown that the deep convolutional neural network is closely related to the data-driven Hankel matrix decomposition. By synergistically combining these findings, here we propose a k-space deep learning approach that immediately corrects the k-space phase mismatch without a reference scan. Reconstruction results using 7T in vivo data showed that the proposed reference-free k-space deep learning approach for EPI ghost correction significantly improves the image quality compared to the existing methods, and the computing time is several orders of magnitude faster. 
### 6.IGCV3: Interleaved Low-Rank Group Convolutions for Efficient Deep Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00178.pdf)
> In this paper, we are interested in building lightweight and efficient convolutional neural networks. Inspired by the success of two design patterns, composition of structured sparse kernels, e.g., interleaved group convolutions (IGC), and composition of low-rank kernels, e.g., bottle-neck modules, we study the combination of such two design patterns, using the composition of structured sparse low-rank kernels, to form a convolutional kernel. Rather than introducing a complementary condition over channels, we introduce a loose complementary condition, which is formulated by imposing the complementary condition over super-channels, to guide the design for generating a dense convolutional kernel. The resulting network is called IGCV3. We empirically demonstrate that the combination of low-rank and sparse kernels boosts the performance and the superiority of our proposed approach to the state-of-the-arts, IGCV2 and MobileNetV2 over image classification on CIFAR and ImageNet and object detection on COCO. 
### 7.Hyperspectral Image Denoising Employing a Spatial-Spectral Deep Residual  Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00183.pdf)
> Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing procedure to improve the performance of the subsequent HSI interpretation and applications. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based method for this task is proposed, by learning a non-linear end-to-end mapping between the noisy and clean HSIs with a combined spatial-spectral deep convolutional neural network (HSID-CNN). Both the spatial and spectral information are simultaneously assigned to the proposed network. In addition, multi-scale feature extraction and multi-level feature representation are respectively employed to capture both the multi-scale spatial-spectral feature and fuse the feature representations with different levels for the final restoration. The simulated and real-data experiments demonstrate that the proposed HSID-CNN outperforms many of the mainstream methods in both the quantitative evaluation indexes, visual effects, and HSI classification accuracy. 
### 8.Video Description: A Survey of Methods, Datasets and Evaluation Metrics [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00186.pdf)
> Automatic video description is useful for assisting the visually impaired, human computer interaction, robotics and video indexing. The past few years have seen a surge of research interest in this area due to the unprecedented success of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing. Numerous methods, datasets and evaluation measures have been proposed in the literature calling the need for a comprehensive survey to better focus research efforts in this flourishing direction. This paper answers exactly to this need by surveying state of the art approaches including deep learning models; comparing benchmark datasets in terms of their domain, number of classes, and repository size; and identifying the pros and cons of various evaluation metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE and WMD. Our survey shows that video description research has a long way to go before it can match human performance and that the main reasons for this shortfall are twofold. Firstly, existing datasets do not adequately represent the diversity in open domain videos and complex linguistic structures. Secondly, current measures of evaluation are not aligned with human judgement. For example, the same video can have very different, yet correct descriptions. We conclude that there is a need for improvement in evaluation measures as well as datasets in terms of size, diversity and annotation accuracy because they directly influence the development of better video description models. From an algorithmic point of view, diagnosis of the description quality is challenging because of the difficultly to assess the level of contribution from visual features compared to the bias that comes naturally from the language model adopted. 
### 9.Deep Imbalanced Learning for Face Recognition and Attribute Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00194.pdf)
> Data for face analysis often exhibit highly-skewed class distribution, i.e., most data belong to a few majority classes, while the minority classes only contain a scarce amount of instances. To mitigate this issue, contemporary deep learning methods typically follow classic strategies such as class re-sampling or cost-sensitive training. In this paper, we conduct extensive and systematic experiments to validate the effectiveness of these classic schemes for representation learning on class-imbalanced data. We further demonstrate that more discriminative deep representation can be learned by enforcing a deep network to maintain inter-cluster margins both within and between classes. This tight constraint effectively reduces the class imbalance inherent in the local data neighborhood, thus carving much more balanced class boundaries locally. We show that it is easy to deploy angular margins between the cluster distributions on a hypersphere manifold. Such learned Cluster-based Large Margin Local Embedding (CLMLE), when combined with a simple k-nearest cluster algorithm, shows significant improvements in accuracy over existing methods on both face recognition and face attribute prediction tasks that exhibit imbalanced class distribution. 
### 10.Generative Adversarial Networks for Unsupervised Object Co-localization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00236.pdf)
> This paper introduces a novel approach for unsupervised object co-localization using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GAN is a powerful tool that can implicitly learn unknown data distributions in an unsupervised manner. From the observation that GAN discriminator is highly influenced by pixels where objects appear, we analyze the internal layers of discriminator and visualize the activated pixels. Our important finding is that high image diversity of GAN, which is a main goal in GAN research, is ironically disadvantageous for object localization, because such discriminators focus not only on the target object, but also on the various objects, such as background objects. Based on extensive evaluations and experimental studies, we show the image diversity and localization performance have a negative correlation. In addition, our approach achieves meaningful accuracy for unsupervised object co-localization using publicly available benchmark datasets, even comparable to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised approach. 
### 11.Combining Pyramid Pooling and Attention Mechanism for Pelvic MR Image  Semantic Segmentaion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00264.pdf)
> One of the time-consuming routine work for a radiologist is to discern anatomical structures from tomographic images. For assisting radiologists, this paper develops an automatic segmentation method for pelvic magnetic resonance (MR) images. The task has three major challenges 1) A pelvic organ can have various sizes and shapes depending on the axial image, which requires local contexts to segment correctly. 2) Different organs often have quite similar appearance in MR images, which requires global context to segment. 3) The number of available annotated images are very small to use the latest segmentation algorithms. To address the challenges, we propose a novel convolutional neural network called Attention-Pyramid network (APNet) that effectively exploits both local and global contexts, in addition to a data-augmentation technique that is particularly effective for MR images. In order to evaluate our method, we construct fine-grained (50 pelvic organs) MR image segmentation dataset, and experimentally confirm the superior performance of our techniques over the state-of-the-art image segmentation methods. 
### 12.Learn the new, keep the old: Extending pretrained models with new  anatomy and images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00265.pdf)
> Deep learning has been widely accepted as a promising solution for medical image segmentation, given a sufficiently large representative dataset of images with corresponding annotations. With ever increasing amounts of annotated medical datasets, it is infeasible to train a learning method always with all data from scratch. This is also doomed to hit computational limits, e.g., memory or runtime feasible for training. Incremental learning can be a potential solution, where new information (images or anatomy) is introduced iteratively. Nevertheless, for the preservation of the collective information, it is essential to keep some "important" (i.e. representative) images and annotations from the past, while adding new information. In this paper, we introduce a framework for applying incremental learning for segmentation and propose novel methods for selecting representative data therein. We comparatively evaluate our methods in different scenarios using MR images and validate the increased learning capacity with using our methods. 
### 13.Automatic Detection of Neurons in NeuN-stained Histological Images of  Human Brain [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00292.pdf)
> In this paper, we present a novel use of an anisotropic diffusion model for automatic detection of neurons in histological sections of the adult human brain cortex. We use a partial differential equation model to process high resolution images to acquire locations of neuronal bodies. We also present a novel approach in model training and evaluation that considers variability among the human experts, addressing the issue of existence and correctness of the golden standard for neuron and cell counting, used in most of relevant papers. Our method, trained on dataset manually labeled by three experts, has correctly distinguished over 95% of neuron bodies in test data, doing so in time much shorter than other comparable methods. 
### 14.Towards a new system for drowsiness detection based on eye blinking and  head posture estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00360.pdf)
> Driver drowsiness problem is considered as one of the most important reasons that increases road accidents number. We propose in this paper a new approach for realtime driver drowsiness in order to prevent road accidents. The system uses a smart video camera that takes drivers faces images and supervises the eye blink (open and close) state and head posture to detect the different drowsiness states. Face and eye detection are done by Viola and Jones technique. 
### 15.Domain Adaptation for MRI Organ Segmentation using Reverse  Classification Accuracy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00363.pdf)
> The variations in multi-center data in medical imaging studies have brought the necessity of domain adaptation. Despite the advancement of machine learning in automatic segmentation, performance often degrades when algorithms are applied on new data acquired from different scanners or sequences than the training data. Manual annotation is costly and time consuming if it has to be carried out for every new target domain. In this work, we investigate automatic selection of suitable subjects to be annotated for supervised domain adaptation using the concept of reverse classification accuracy (RCA). RCA predicts the performance of a trained model on data from the new domain and different strategies of selecting subjects to be included in the adaptation via transfer learning are evaluated. We perform experiments on a two-center MR database for the task of organ segmentation. We show that subject selection via RCA can reduce the burden of annotation of new data for the target domain. 
### 16.Accurate and Efficient Similarity Search for Large Scale Face  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00365.pdf)
> Face verification is a relatively easy task with the help of discriminative features from deep neural networks. However, it is still a challenge to recognize faces on millions of identities while keeping high performance and efficiency. The challenge 2 of MS-Celeb-1M is a classification task. However, the number of identities is too large and it is not that elegant to treat the task as an image classification task. We treat the classification task as similarity search and do experiments on different similarity search strategies. Similarity search strategy accelerates the speed of searching and boosts the accuracy of final results. The model used for extracting features is a single deep neural network pretrained on CASIA-Webface, which is not trained on the base set or novel set offered by official. Finally, we rank \textbf{3rd}, while the speed of searching is 1ms/image. 
### 17.Radio Galaxy Morphology Generation Using DNN Autoencoder and Gaussian  Mixture Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00398.pdf)
> The morphology of a radio galaxy is highly affected by its central active galactic nuclei (AGN), which is studied to reveal the evolution of the super massive black hole (SMBH). In this work, we propose a morphology generation framework for two typical radio galaxies namely Fanaroff-Riley type-I (FRI) and type-II (FRII) with deep neural network based autoencoder (DNNAE) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The encoder and decoder subnets in the DNNAE are symmetric aside a fully-connected layer namely code layer hosting the extracted feature vectors. By randomly generating the feature vectors later with a three-component Gaussian Mixture models, new FRI or FRII radio galaxy morphologies are simulated. Experiments were demonstrated on real radio galaxy images, where we discussed the length of feature vectors, selection of lost functions, and made comparisons on batch normalization and dropout techniques for training the network. The results suggest a high efficiency and performance of our morphology generation framework. Code is available at: <a href="https://github.com/myinxd/dnnae-gmm.">this https URL</a> 
### 18.Oversegmenting Graphs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00411.pdf)
> We propose a novel method to adapt a graph to image data. The method drives the nodes of the graph towards image features. The adaptation process naturally lends itself to a measure of feature saliency which can then be used to retain meaningful nodes and edges in the graph. From the adapted graph, we propose the computation of a dual graph, which inherits the saliency measure from the adapted graph, and whose edges run along image features hence producing an oversegmenting graph. This dual graph captures the structure of the underlying image, and therefore constitutes a sparse representation of the image features and their topology. The proposed method is computationally efficient and fully parallelisable. We propose two distance measures find image saliency along graph edges, and evaluate its performance on synthetic images and on natural images from publicly available databases. In both cases, the salient-most nodes of the graph achieve average boundary recall over 90%. We also provide a qualitative comparison with two related techniques: superpixel clustering, and variational image meshing, showing potential for a large number of applications. 
### 19.A Classification approach towards Unsupervised Learning of Visual  Representations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00428.pdf)
> In this paper, we present a technique for unsupervised learning of visual representations. Specifically, we train a model for foreground and background classification task, in the process of which it learns visual representations. Foreground and background patches for training come af- ter mining for such patches from hundreds and thousands of unlabelled videos available on the web which we ex- tract using a proposed patch extraction algorithm. With- out using any supervision, with just using 150, 000 unla- belled videos and the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, we train a object recognition model that achieves 45.3 mAP which is close to the best performing unsupervised feature learn- ing technique whereas better than many other proposed al- gorithms. The code for patch extraction is implemented in Matlab and available open source at the following link . 
### 20.Surgical Activity Recognition in Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy  using Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00466.pdf)
> Adverse surgical outcomes are costly to patients and hospitals. Approaches to benchmark surgical care are often limited to gross measures across the entire procedure despite the performance of particular tasks being largely responsible for undesirable outcomes. In order to produce metrics from tasks as opposed to the whole procedure, methods to recognize automatically individual surgical tasks are needed. In this paper, we propose several approaches to recognize surgical activities in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery using deep learning. We collected a clinical dataset of 100 robot-assisted radical prostatectomies (RARP) with 12 tasks each and propose `RP-Net', a modified version of InceptionV3 model, for image based surgical activity recognition. We achieve an average precision of 80.9% and average recall of 76.7% across all tasks using RP-Net which out-performs all other RNN and CNN based models explored in this paper. Our results suggest that automatic surgical activity recognition during RARP is feasible and can be the foundation for advanced analytics. 
### 21.Targeted Kernel Networks: Faster Convolutions with Attentive  Regularization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00523.pdf)
> We propose Attentive Regularization (AR), a method to constrain the activation maps of kernels in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to specific regions of interest (ROIs). Each kernel learns a location of specialization along with its weights through standard backpropagation. A differentiable attention mechanism requiring no additional supervision is used to optimize the ROIs. Traditional CNNs of different types and structures can be modified with this idea into equivalent Targeted Kernel Networks (TKNs), while keeping the network size nearly identical. By restricting kernel ROIs, we reduce the number of sliding convolutional operations performed throughout the network in its forward pass, speeding up both training and inference. We evaluate our proposed architecture on both synthetic and natural tasks across multiple domains. TKNs obtain significant improvements over baselines, requiring less computation (around an order of magnitude) while achieving superior performance. 
### 22.Spatially Localized Atlas Network Tiles Enables 3D Whole Brain  Segmentation from Limited Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00546.pdf)
> Whole brain segmentation on a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential in non-invasive investigation for neuroanatomy. Historically, multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) has been regarded as the de facto standard method for whole brain segmentation. Recently, deep neural network approaches have been applied to whole brain segmentation by learning random patches or 2D slices. Yet, few previous efforts have been made on detailed whole brain segmentation using 3D networks due to the following challenges: (1) fitting entire whole brain volume into 3D networks is restricted by the current GPU memory, and (2) the large number of targeting labels (e.g., &gt; 100 labels) with limited number of training 3D volumes (e.g., &lt; 50 scans). In this paper, we propose the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) method to distribute multiple independent 3D fully convolutional networks to cover overlapped sub-spaces in a standard atlas space. This strategy simplifies the whole brain learning task to localized sub-tasks, which was enabled by combing canonical registration and label fusion techniques with deep learning. To address the second challenge, auxiliary labels on 5111 initially unlabeled scans were created by MAS for pre-training. From empirical validation, the state-of-the-art MAS method achieved mean Dice value of 0.76, 0.71, and 0.68, while the proposed method achieved 0.78, 0.73, and 0.71 on three validation cohorts. Moreover, the computational time reduced from &gt; 30 hours using MAS to ~15 minutes using the proposed method.

### 23.SCAN: Sliding Convolutional Attention Network for Scene Text Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00578.pdf)
> Scene text recognition has drawn great attentions in the community of computer vision and artificial intelligence due to its challenges and wide applications. State-of-the-art recurrent neural networks (RNN) based models map an input sequence to a variable length output sequence, but are usually applied in a black box manner and lack of transparency for further improvement, and the maintaining of the entire past hidden states prevents parallel computation in a sequence. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic characteristics of text recognition, and inspired by human cognition mechanisms in reading texts, we propose a scene text recognition method with sliding convolutional attention network (SCAN). Similar to the eye movement during reading, the process of SCAN can be viewed as an alternation between saccades and visual fixations. Compared to the previous recurrent models, computations over all elements of SCAN can be fully parallelized during training. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks, including the IIIT5k, SVT and ICDAR 2003/2013 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of SCAN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the model interpretability and performance. 
### 24.Monocular Depth Estimation with Augmented Ordinal Depth Relationships [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00585.pdf)
> Most existing algorithms for depth estimation from single monocular images need large quantities of metric groundtruth depths for supervised learning. We show that relative depth can be an informative cue for metric depth estimation and can be easily obtained from vast stereo videos. Acquiring metric depths from stereo videos is sometimes impracticable due to the absence of camera parameters. In this paper, we propose to improve the performance of metric depth estimation with relative depths collected from stereo movie videos using existing stereo matching algorithm. We introduce a new "Relative Depth in Stereo" (RDIS) dataset densely labelled with relative depths. We first pretrain a ResNet model on our RDIS dataset. Then we finetune the model on RGB-D datasets with metric ground-truth depths. During our finetuning, we formulate depth estimation as a classification task. This re-formulation scheme enables us to obtain the confidence of a depth prediction in the form of probability distribution. With this confidence, we propose an information gain loss to make use of the predictions that are close to ground-truth. We evaluate our approach on both indoor and outdoor benchmark RGB-D datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance. 
### 25.BoxNet: Deep Learning Based Biomedical Image Segmentation Using Boxes  Only Annotation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00593.pdf)
> In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have become powerful tools for biomedical image segmentation. However, high annotation efforts and costs are commonly needed to acquire sufficient biomedical training data for DL models. To alleviate the burden of manual annotation, in this paper, we propose a new weakly supervised DL approach for biomedical image segmentation using boxes only annotation. First, we develop a method to combine graph search (GS) and DL to generate fine object masks from box annotation, in which DL uses box annotation to compute a rough segmentation for GS and then GS is applied to locate the optimal object boundaries. During the mask generation process, we carefully utilize information from box annotation to filter out potential errors, and then use the generated masks to train an accurate DL segmentation network. Extensive experiments on gland segmentation in histology images, lymph node segmentation in ultrasound images, and fungus segmentation in electron microscopy images show that our approach attains superior performance over the best known state-of-the-art weakly supervised DL method and is able to achieve (1) nearly the same accuracy compared to fully supervised DL methods with far less annotation effort, (2) significantly better results with similar annotation time, and (3) robust performance in various applications. 
### 26.Semantic-Aware Generative Adversarial Nets for Unsupervised Domain  Adaptation in Chest X-ray Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00600.pdf)
> In spite of the compelling achievements that deep neural networks (DNNs) have made in medical image computing, these deep models often suffer from degraded performance when being applied to new test datasets with domain shift. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised domain adaptation approach for segmentation tasks by designing semantic-aware generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, we transform the test image into the appearance of source domain, with the semantic structural information being well preserved, which is achieved by imposing a nested adversarial learning in semantic label space. In this way, the segmentation DNN learned from the source domain is able to be directly generalized to the transformed test image, eliminating the need of training a new model for every new target dataset. Our domain adaptation procedure is unsupervised, without using any target domain labels. The adversarial learning of our network is guided by a GAN loss for mapping data distributions, a cycle-consistency loss for retaining pixel-level content, and a semantic-aware loss for enhancing structural information. We validated our method on two different chest X-ray public datasets for left/right lung segmentation. Experimental results show that the segmentation performance of our unsupervised approach is highly competitive with the upper bound of supervised transfer learning. 
### 27.DAQN: Deep Auto-encoder and Q-Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00630.pdf)
> The deep reinforcement learning method usually requires a large number of training images and executing actions to obtain sufficient results. When it is extended a real-task in the real environment with an actual robot, the method will be required more training images due to complexities or noises of the input images, and executing a lot of actions on the real robot also becomes a serious problem. Therefore, we propose an extended deep reinforcement learning method that is applied a generative model to initialize the network for reducing the number of training trials. In this paper, we used a deep q-network method as the deep reinforcement learning method and a deep auto-encoder as the generative model. We conducted experiments on three different tasks: a cart-pole game, an atari game, and a real-game with an actual robot. The proposed method trained efficiently on all tasks than the previous method, especially 2.5 times faster on a task with real environment images. 
### 28.Squeeze-and-Excitation on Spatial and Temporal Deep Feature Space for  Action Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00631.pdf)
> Spatial and temporal features are two key and complementary information for human action recognition. In order to make full use of the intra-frame spatial characteristics and inter-frame temporal relationships, we propose the Squeeze-and-Excitation Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (SE-LRCN) for human action recognition. The Squeeze and Excitation operations are used to implement the feature recalibration. In SE-LRCN, Squeeze-and-Excitation ResNet-34 (SE-ResNet-34) network is adopted to extract spatial features to enhance the dependencies and importance of feature channels of pixel granularity. We also propose the Squeeze-and-Excitation Long Short-Term Memory (SE-LSTM) network to model the temporal relationship, and to enhance the dependencies and importance of feature channels of frame granularity. We evaluate the proposed model on two challenging benchmarks, HMDB51 and UCF101, and the proposed SE-LRCN achieves the competitive results with the state-of-the-art. 
### 29.An Interpretable Deep Hierarchical Semantic Convolutional Neural Network  for Lung Nodule Malignancy Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00712.pdf)
> While deep learning methods are increasingly being applied to tasks such as computer-aided diagnosis, these models are difficult to interpret, do not incorporate prior domain knowledge, and are often considered as a "black-box." The lack of model interpretability hinders them from being fully understood by target users such as radiologists. In this paper, we present a novel interpretable deep hierarchical semantic convolutional neural network (HSCNN) to predict whether a given pulmonary nodule observed on a computed tomography (CT) scan is malignant. Our network provides two levels of output: 1) low-level radiologist semantic features, and 2) a high-level malignancy prediction score. The low-level semantic outputs quantify the diagnostic features used by radiologists and serve to explain how the model interprets the images in an expert-driven manner. The information from these low-level tasks, along with the representations learned by the convolutional layers, are then combined and used to infer the high-level task of predicting nodule malignancy. This unified architecture is trained by optimizing a global loss function including both low- and high-level tasks, thereby learning all the parameters within a joint framework. Our experimental results using the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) show that the proposed method not only produces interpretable lung cancer predictions but also achieves significantly better results compared to common 3D CNN approaches. 
### 30.Content-based Video Relevance Prediction Challenge: Data, Protocol, and  Baseline [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00737.pdf)
> Video relevance prediction is one of the most important tasks for online streaming service. Given the relevance of videos and viewer feedbacks, the system can provide personalized recommendations, which will help the user discover more content of interest. In most online service, the computation of video relevance table is based on users' implicit feedback, e.g. watch and search history. However, this kind of method performs poorly for "cold-start" problems - when a new video is added to the library, the recommendation system needs to bootstrap the video relevance score with very little user behavior known. One promising approach to solve it is analyzing video content itself, i.e. predicting video relevance by video frame, audio, subtitle and metadata. In this paper, we describe a challenge on Content-based Video Relevance Prediction (CBVRP) that is hosted by Hulu in the ACM Multimedia Conference 2018. In this challenge, Hulu drives the study on an open problem of exploiting content characteristics directly from original video for video relevance prediction. We provide massive video assets and ground truth relevance derived from our really system, to build up a common platform for algorithm development and performance evaluation. 
### 31.Eye in the Sky: Real-time Drone Surveillance System (DSS) for Violent  Individuals Identification using ScatterNet Hybrid Deep Learning Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00746.pdf)
> Drone systems have been deployed by various law enforcement agencies to monitor hostiles, spy on foreign drug cartels, conduct border control operations, etc. This paper introduces a real-time drone surveillance system to identify violent individuals in public areas. The system first uses the Feature Pyramid Network to detect humans from aerial images. The image region with the human is used by the proposed ScatterNet Hybrid Deep Learning (SHDL) network for human pose estimation. The orientations between the limbs of the estimated pose are next used to identify the violent individuals. The proposed deep network can learn meaningful representations quickly using ScatterNet and structural priors with relatively fewer labeled examples. The system detects the violent individuals in real-time by processing the drone images in the cloud. This research also introduces the aerial violent individual dataset used for training the deep network which hopefully may encourage researchers interested in using deep learning for aerial surveillance. The pose estimation and violent individuals identification performance is compared with the state-of-the-art techniques. 
### 32.Low Cost Edge Sensing for High Quality Demosaicking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00771.pdf)
> Digital cameras that use Color Filter Arrays (CFA) entail a demosaicking procedure to form full RGB images. As today's camera users generally require images to be viewed instantly, demosaicking algorithms for real applications must be fast. Moreover, the associated cost should be lower than the cost saved by using CFA. For this purpose, we revisit the classical Hamilton-Adams (HA) algorithm, which outperforms many sophisticated techniques in both speed and accuracy. Inspired by HA's strength and weakness, we design a very low cost edge sensing scheme. Briefly, it guides demosaicking by a logistic functional of the difference between directional variations. We extensively compare our algorithm with 28 demosaicking algorithms by running their open source codes on benchmark datasets. Compared to methods of similar computational cost, our method achieves substantially higher accuracy, Whereas compared to methods of similar accuracy, our method has significantly lower cost. Moreover, on test images of currently popular resolution, the quality of our algorithm is comparable to top performers, whereas its speed is tens of times faster. 
### 33.ProFlow: Learning to Predict Optical Flow [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00800.pdf)
> Temporal coherence is a valuable source of information in the context of optical flow estimation. However, finding a suitable motion model to leverage this information is a non-trivial task. In this paper we propose an unsupervised online learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that estimates such a motion model individually for each frame. By relating forward and backward motion these learned models not only allow to infer valuable motion information based on the backward flow, they also help to improve the performance at occlusions, where a reliable prediction is particularly useful. Moreover, our learned models are spatially variant and hence allow to estimate non-rigid motion per construction. This, in turns, allows to overcome the major limitation of recent rigidity-based approaches that seek to improve the estimation by incorporating additional stereo/SfM constraints. Experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our new approach. They not only show a consistent improvement of up to 27% for all major benchmarks (KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, MPI Sintel) compared to a baseline without prediction, they also show top results for the MPI Sintel benchmark -- the one of the three benchmarks that contains the largest amount of non-rigid motion. 
### 34.AID++: An Updated Version of AID on Scene Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00801.pdf)
> Aerial image scene classification is a fundamental problem for understanding high-resolution remote sensing images and has become an active research task in the field of remote sensing due to its important role in a wide range of applications. However, the limitations of existing datasets for scene classification, such as the small scale and low-diversity, severely hamper the potential usage of the new generation deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although huge efforts have been made in building large-scale datasets very recently, e.g., the Aerial Image Dataset (AID) which contains 10,000 image samples, they are still far from sufficient to fully train a high-capacity deep CNN model. To this end, we present a larger-scale dataset in this paper, named as AID++, for aerial scene classification based on the AID dataset. The proposed AID++ consists of more than 400,000 image samples that are semi-automatically annotated by using the existing the geographical data. We evaluate several prevalent CNN models on the proposed dataset, and the results show that our dataset can be used as a promising benchmark for scene classification. 
### 35.k-Space Deep Learning for Parallel MRI: Application to Time-Resolved MR  Angiography [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00806.pdf)
> Time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories (TWIST) has been widely used for dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). To achieve highly accelerated acquisitions, TWIST combines the periphery of the k-space data from several adjacent frames to reconstruct one temporal frame. However, this view-sharing scheme limits the true temporal resolution of TWIST. Moreover, the k-space sampling patterns have been specially designed for a specific generalized autocalibrating partial parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) factor so that it is not possible to reduce the number of view-sharing once the k-data is acquired. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel k-space deep learning approach for parallel MRI. In particular, we have designed our neural network so that accurate k-space interpolations are performed simultaneously for multiple coils by exploiting the redundancies along the coils and images. Reconstruction results using in vivo TWIST data set confirm that the proposed method can immediately generate high-quality reconstruction results with various choices of view- sharing, allowing us to exploit the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution in time-resolved MR angiography. 
### 36.Study and development of a Computer-Aided Diagnosis system for  classification of chest x-ray images using convolutional neural networks  pre-trained for ImageNet and data augmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00839.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) are the actual standard for image recognizement and classification. On the present work we develop a Computer Aided-Diagnosis (CAD) system using ConvNets to classify a x-rays chest images dataset in two groups: Normal and Pneumonia. The study uses ConvNets models available on the PyTorch platform: AlexNet, SqueezeNet, ResNet and Inception. We initially use three training styles: complete from scratch using random initialization, using a pre-trained ImageNet model training only the last layer adapted to our problem (transfer learning) and a pre-trained model modified training all the classifying layers of the model (fine tuning). The last strategy of training used is with data augmentation techniques that avoid over fitting problems on ConvNets yielding the better results on this study 
### 37.TernausNetV2: Fully Convolutional Network for Instance Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00844.pdf)
> The most common approaches to instance segmentation are complex and use two-stage networks with object proposals, conditional random-fields, template matching or recurrent neural networks. In this work we present TernausNetV2 - a simple fully convolutional network that allows extracting objects from a high-resolution satellite imagery on an instance level. The network has popular encoder-decoder type of architecture with skip connections but has a few essential modifications that allows using for semantic as well as for instance segmentation tasks. This approach is universal and allows to extend any network that has been successfully applied for semantic segmentation to perform instance segmentation task. In addition, we generalize network encoder that was pre-trained for RGB images to use additional input channels. It makes possible to use transfer learning from visual to a wider spectral range. For DeepGlobe-CVPR 2018 building detection sub-challenge, based on public leaderboard score, our approach shows superior performance in comparison to other methods. The source code corresponding pre-trained weights are publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/ternaus/TernausNetV2">this https URL</a> 
### 38.On the Flip Side: Identifying Counterexamples in Visual Question  Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00857.pdf)
> Visual question answering (VQA) models respond to open-ended natural language questions about images. While VQA is an increasingly popular area of research, it is unclear to what extent current VQA architectures learn key semantic distinctions between visually-similar images. To investigate this question, we explore a reformulation of the VQA task that challenges models to identify counterexamples: images that result in a different answer to the original question. We introduce two methods for evaluating existing VQA models against a supervised counterexample prediction task, VQA-CX. While our models surpass existing benchmarks on VQA-CX, we find that the multimodal representations learned by an existing state-of-the-art VQA model do not meaningfully contribute to performance on this task. These results call into question the assumption that successful performance on the VQA benchmark is indicative of general visual-semantic reasoning abilities. 
### 39.A Comprehensive Comparison between Neural Style Transfer and Universal  Style Transfer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00868.pdf)
> Style transfer aims to transfer arbitrary visual styles to content images. We explore algorithms adapted from two papers that try to solve the problem of style transfer while generalizing on unseen styles or compromised visual quality. Majority of the improvements made focus on optimizing the algorithm for real-time style transfer while adapting to new styles with considerably less resources and constraints. We compare these strategies and compare how they measure up to produce visually appealing images. We explore two approaches to style transfer: neural style transfer with improvements and universal style transfer. We also make a comparison between the different images produced and how they can be qualitatively measured. 
### 40.Patch-Based Image Hallucination for Super Resolution with Detail  Reconstruction from Similar Sample Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00874.pdf)
> Image hallucination and super-resolution have been studied for decades, and many approaches have been proposed to upsample low-resolution images using information from the images themselves, multiple example images, or large image databases. However, most of this work has focused exclusively on small magnification levels because the algorithms simply sharpen the blurry edges in the upsampled images - no actual new detail is typically reconstructed in the final result. In this paper, we present a patch-based algorithm for image hallucination which, for the first time, properly synthesizes novel high frequency detail. To do this, we pose the synthesis problem as a patch-based optimization which inserts coherent, high-frequency detail from contextually-similar images of the same physical scene/subject provided from either a personal image collection or a large online database. The resulting image is visually plausible and contains coherent high frequency information. We demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm by testing it on a large number of images and show that its performance is considerably superior to all state-of-the-art approaches, a result that is verified to be statistically significant through a randomized user study. 
### 41.Soccer on Your Tabletop [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00890.pdf)
> We present a system that transforms a monocular video of a soccer game into a moving 3D reconstruction, in which the players and field can be rendered interactively with a 3D viewer or through an Augmented Reality device. At the heart of our paper is an approach to estimate the depth map of each player, using a CNN that is trained on 3D player data extracted from soccer video games. We compare with state of the art body pose and depth estimation techniques, and show results on both synthetic ground truth benchmarks, and real YouTube soccer footage. 
### 42.Recent advances and opportunities in scene classification of aerial  images with deep models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00899.pdf)
> Scene classification is a fundamental task in interpretation of remote sensing images, and has become an active research topic in remote sensing community due to its important role in a wide range of applications. Over the past years, tremendous efforts have been made for developing powerful approaches for scene classification of remote sensing images, evolving from the traditional bag-of-visual-words model to the new generation deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The deep CNN based methods have exhibited remarkable breakthrough on performance, dramatically outperforming previous methods which strongly rely on hand-crafted features. However, performance with deep CNNs has gradually plateaued on existing public scene datasets, due to the notable drawbacks of these datasets, such as the small scale and low-diversity of training samples. Therefore, to promote the development of new methods and move the scene classification task a step further, we deeply discuss the existing problems in scene classification task, and accordingly present three open directions. We believe these potential directions will be instructive for the researchers in this field. 
### 43.Large-scale Land Cover Classification in GaoFen-2 Satellite Imagery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00901.pdf)
> Many significant applications need land cover information of remote sensing images that are acquired from different areas and times, such as change detection and disaster monitoring. However, it is difficult to find a generic land cover classification scheme for different remote sensing images due to the spectral shift caused by diverse acquisition condition. In this paper, we develop a novel land cover classification method that can deal with large-scale data captured from widely distributed areas and different times. Additionally, we establish a large-scale land cover classification dataset consisting of 150 Gaofen-2 imageries as data support for model training and performance evaluation. Our experiments achieve outstanding classification accuracy compared with traditional methods. 
### 44.Accurate Building Detection in VHR Remote Sensing Images using Geometric  Saliency [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00908.pdf)
> This paper aims to address the problem of detecting buildings from remote sensing images with very high resolution (VHR). Inspired by the observation that buildings are always more distinguishable in geometries than in texture or spectral, we propose a new geometric building index (GBI) for accurate building detection, which relies on the geometric saliency of building structures. The geometric saliency of buildings is derived from a mid-level geometric representations based on meaningful junctions that can locally describe anisotropic geometrical structures of images. The resulting GBI is measured by integrating the derived geometric saliency of buildings. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed GBI achieves very promising performance, and meanwhile shows impressive generalization capability. 
### 45.Bayesian Semantic Instance Segmentation in Open Set World [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00911.pdf)
> This paper addresses the semantic instance segmentation task in the open-set conditions, where input images can contain known and unknown object classes. The training process of existing semantic instance segmentation methods requires annotation masks for all object instances, which is expensive to acquire or even infeasible in some realistic scenarios, where the number of categories may increase boundlessly. In this paper, we present a novel open-set semantic instance segmentation approach capable of segmenting all known and unknown object classes in images, based on the output of an object detector trained on known object classes. We formulate the problem using a Bayesian framework, where the posterior distribution is approximated with a simulated annealing optimization equipped with an efficient image partition sampler. We show empirically that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised methods on known classes, but also performs well on unknown classes when compared with unsupervised methods. 
### 46.Automatic catheter detection in pediatric X-ray images using a  scale-recurrent network and synthetic data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00921.pdf)
> Catheters are commonly inserted life supporting devices. X-ray images are used to assess the position of a catheter immediately after placement as serious complications can arise from malpositioned catheters. Previous computer vision approaches to detect catheters on X-ray images either relied on low-level cues that are not sufficiently robust or only capable of processing a limited number or type of catheters. With the resurgence of deep learning, supervised training approaches are begining to showing promising results. However, dense annotation maps are required, and the work of a human annotator is hard to scale. In this work, we proposed a simple way of synthesizing catheters on X-ray images and a scale recurrent network for catheter detection. By training on adult chest X-rays, the proposed network exhibits promising detection results on pediatric chest/abdomen X-rays in terms of both precision and recall. 
### 47.NRTR: A No-Recurrence Sequence-to-Sequence Model For Scene Text  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00926.pdf)
> Scene text recognition has attracted a great many researches for decades due to its importance to various applications. Existing sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) recognizers mainly adopt Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) or Attention based Recurrent or Convolutional networks, and have made great progresses in scene text recognition. However, we observe that current methods suffer from slow training speed because the internal recurrence of RNNs limits training parallelization, and high complexity because of stacking too many convolutional layers in order to extract features over long input sequence. To tackle the above problems, this paper presents a no-recurrence seq2seq model, named NRTR, that relies only on the attention mechanism dispensing with recurrences and convolutions entirely. NRTR consists of an encoder that transforms an input sequence to the hidden feature representation, and a decoder that generates an output sequence of characters from the encoder output. Both of the encoder and the decoder are based on self-attention module to learn positional dependencies, which could be trained with more parallelization and less complexity. Besides, we also propose a modality-transform block to effectively transform the input image to the corresponding sequence, which could be used by the encoder directly. NRTR is end-to-end trainable and is not confined to any predefined lexicon. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including the IIIT5K, SVT and ICDAR datasets, show that NRTR achieves the state-of-the-art or highly-competitive performances in both lexicon-free and lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks, while requiring only one order of magnitude less time for model training compared to current methods. 
### 48.Simultaneous compressive image recovery and deep denoiser learning from  undersampled measurements [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00961.pdf)
> Compressive image recovery utilizes sparse image priors such as wavelet l1 norm, total-variation (TV) norm, or self-similarity to reconstruct good quality images from highly compressive samples. Recently, there have been some attempts to exploit data-driven image priors from massive amount of clean images in compressive image recovery such as LDAMP algorithm. By utilizing large-scale noiseless images for training deep neural network denoisers, LDAMP outperformed other conventional compressive image reconstruction methods. However, one drawback of LDAMP is that large-scale noiseless images must be acquired for deep learning based denoisers. In this article, we propose a method for simultaneous compressive image recovery and deep denoiser learning from undersampled measurements that enables compressive image recovery methods to use data-driven image priors when only large-scale compressive samples are available without ground truth images. By utilizing the structure of LDAMP and Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) based deep neural network denoiser, we showed that our proposed methods were able to achieve better performance than other methods such as conventional BM3D-AMP and LDAMP methods trained with the results of BM3D-AMP for training data and/or testing data for all cases with i.i.d. Gaussian random and coded diffraction measurement matrices at various compression ratios. We also investigated accurate noise level estimation methods in LDAMP for coded diffraction measurement matrix to train deep denoiser networks for high performance. 
### 49.ALMN: Deep Embedding Learning with Geometrical Virtual Point Generating [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00974.pdf)
> Deep embedding learning becomes more attractive for discriminative feature learning, but many methods still require hard-class mining, which is computationally complex and performance-sensitive. To this end, we propose Adaptive Large Margin N-Pair loss (ALMN) to address the aforementioned issues. Instead of exploring hard example-mining strategy, we introduce the concept of large margin constraint. This constraint aims at encouraging local-adaptive large angular decision margin among dissimilar samples in multimodal feature space so as to significantly encourage intraclass compactness and interclass separability. And it is mainly achieved by a simple yet novel geometrical Virtual Point Generating (VPG) method, which converts artificially setting a fixed margin into automatically generating a boundary training sample in feature space and is an open question. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several popular datasets for image retrieval and clustering tasks. 
### 50.Synthetic data generation for end-to-end thermal infrared tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01013.pdf)
> The usage of both off-the-shelf and end-to-end trained deep networks have significantly improved performance of visual tracking on RGB videos. However, the lack of large labeled datasets hampers the usage of convolutional neural networks for tracking in thermal infrared (TIR) images. Therefore, most state of the art methods on tracking for TIR data are still based on handcrafted features. To address this problem, we propose to use image-to-image translation models. These models allow us to translate the abundantly available labeled RGB data to synthetic TIR data. We explore both the usage of paired and unpaired image translation models for this purpose. These methods provide us with a large labeled dataset of synthetic TIR sequences, on which we can train end-to-end optimal features for tracking. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to train end-to-end features for TIR tracking. We perform extensive experiments on VOT-TIR2017 dataset. We show that a network trained on a large dataset of synthetic TIR data obtains better performance than one trained on the available real TIR data. Combining both data sources leads to further improvement. In addition, when we combine the network with motion features we outperform the state of the art with a relative gain of over 10%, clearly showing the efficiency of using synthetic data to train end-to-end TIR trackers. 
### 51.A Cascade of 2.5D CNN and LSTM Network for Mitotic Cell Detection in 4D  Microscopy Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01018.pdf)
> In recent years, intravital skin imaging has been used in mammalian skin research for the investigation of cell behaviors. The mitotic cell (cell division) detection is a fundamental step of the investigation. Due to the complex backgrounds (normal cells), most of the existing methods bring a lot of false positives. In this paper, we proposed a 2.5 dimensional (2.5D) cascaded end-to-end network (CasDetNet_LSTM) for accurate automatic mitotic cell detection in 4D microscopic images with fewer training data. The CasDetNet_LSTM consists of two 2.5D networks. The first one is a 2.5D fast region-based convolutional neural network (2.5D Fast R-CNN), which is used for the detection of candidate cells with only volume information and the second one is a long short-term memory (LSTM) network embedded with temporal information, which is used for reduction of false positive and retrieving back those mitotic cells that missed in the first step. The experimental results shown that our CasDetNet_LSTM can achieve higher precision and recall comparing to other state-of-the-art methods. 
### 52.Differential Diagnosis for Pancreatic Cysts in CT Scans Using  Densely-Connected Convolutional Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01023.pdf)
> The lethal nature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) calls for early differential diagnosis of pancreatic cysts, which are identified in up to 16% of normal subjects, and some of which may develop into PDAC. Previous computer-aided developments have achieved certain accuracy for classification on segmented cystic lesions in CT. However, pancreatic cysts have a large variation in size and shape, and the precise segmentation of them remains rather challenging, which restricts the computer-aided interpretation of CT images acquired for differential diagnosis. We propose a computer-aided framework for early differential diagnosis of pancreatic cysts without pre-segmenting the lesions using densely-connected convolutional networks (Dense-Net). The Dense-Net learns high-level features from whole abnormal pancreas and builds mappings between medical imaging appearance to different pathological types of pancreatic cysts. To enhance the clinical applicability, we integrate saliency maps in the framework to assist the physicians to understand the decision of the deep learning method. The test on a cohort of 206 patients with 4 pathologically confirmed subtypes of pancreatic cysts has achieved an overall accuracy of 72.8%, which is significantly higher than the baseline accuracy of 48.1%, which strongly supports the clinical potential of our developed method. 
### 53.RedNet: Residual Encoder-Decoder Network for indoor RGB-D Semantic  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01054.pdf)
> Indoor semantic segmentation has always been a difficult task in computer vision. In this paper, we propose an RGB-D residual encoder-decoder architecture, named RedNet, for indoor RGB-D semantic segmentation. In RedNet, the residual module is applied to both the encoder and decoder as the basic building block, and the skip-connection is used to bypass the spatial feature between the encoder and decoder. In order to incorporate the depth information of the scene, a fusion structure is constructed, which makes inference on RGB image and depth image separately, and fuses their features over several layers. In order to efficiently optimize the network's parameters, we propose a `pyramid supervision' training scheme, which applies supervised learning over different layers in the decoder, to cope with the problem of gradients vanishing. Experiment results show that the proposed RedNet(ResNet-50) achieves a state-of-the-art mIoU accuracy of 47.8% on the SUN RGB-D benchmark dataset. 
### 54.Deep Multi-Structural Shape Analysis: Application to Neuroanatomy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01069.pdf)
> We propose a deep neural network for supervised learning on neuroanatomical shapes. The network directly operates on raw point clouds without the need for mesh processing or the identification of point correspondences, as spatial transformer networks map the data to a canonical space. Instead of relying on hand-crafted shape descriptors, an optimal representation is learned in the end-to-end training stage of the network. The proposed network consists of multiple branches, so that features for multiple structures are learned simultaneously. We demonstrate the performance of our method on two applications: (i) the prediction of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment and (ii) the regression of the brain age. Finally, we visualize the important parts of the anatomy for the prediction by adapting the occlusion method to point clouds. 
### 55.Modeling Realistic Degradations in Non-blind Deconvolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01097.pdf)
> Most image deblurring methods assume an over-simplistic image formation model and as a result are sensitive to more realistic image degradations. We propose a novel variational framework, that explicitly handles pixel saturation, noise, quantization, as well as non-linear camera response function due to e.g., gamma correction. We show that accurately modeling a more realistic image acquisition pipeline leads to significant improvements, both in terms of image quality and PSNR. Furthermore, we show that incorporating the non-linear response in both the data and the regularization terms of the proposed energy leads to a more detailed restoration than a naive inversion of the non-linear curve. The minimization of the proposed energy is performed using stochastic optimization. A dataset consisting of realistically degraded images is created in order to evaluate the method. 
### 56.Deep Continuous Conditional Random Fields with Asymmetric Inter-object  Constraints for Online Multi-object Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01183.pdf)
> Online Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a challenging problem and has many important applications including intelligence surveillance, robot navigation and autonomous driving. In existing MOT methods, individual object's movements and inter-object relations are mostly modeled separately and relations between them are still manually tuned. In addition, inter-object relations are mostly modeled in a symmetric way, which we argue is not an optimal setting. To tackle those difficulties, in this paper, we propose a Deep Continuous Conditional Random Field (DCCRF) for solving the online MOT problem in a track-by-detection framework. The DCCRF consists of unary and pairwise terms. The unary terms estimate tracked objects' displacements across time based on visual appearance information. They are modeled as deep Convolution Neural Networks, which are able to learn discriminative visual features for tracklet association. The asymmetric pairwise terms model inter-object relations in an asymmetric way, which encourages high-confidence tracklets to help correct errors of low-confidence tracklets and not to be affected by low-confidence ones much. The DCCRF is trained in an end-to-end manner for better adapting the influences of visual information as well as inter-object relations. Extensive experimental comparisons with state-of-the-arts as well as detailed component analysis of our proposed DCCRF on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MOT framework. 
### 57.Face Synthesis for Eyeglass-Robust Face Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01196.pdf)
> In the application of face recognition, eyeglasses could significantly degrade the recognition accuracy. A feasible method is to collect large-scale face images with eyeglasses for training deep learning methods. However, it is difficult to collect the images with and without glasses of the same identity, so that it is difficult to optimize the intra-variations caused by eyeglasses. In this paper, we propose to address this problem in a virtual synthesis manner. The high-fidelity face images with eyeglasses are synthesized based on 3D face model and 3D eyeglasses. Models based on deep learning methods are then trained on the synthesized eyeglass face dataset, achieving better performance than previous ones. Experiments on the real face database validate the effectiveness of our synthesized data for improving eyeglass face recognition performance. 
### 58.Image reconstruction through metamorphosis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01225.pdf)
> This article adapts the framework of metamorphosis to solve inverse problems in imaging that includes joint reconstruction and image registration. The deformations in question have two components, one that is a geometric deformation moving intensities and the other a deformation of intensity values itself, which, e.g., allows for appearance of a new structure. The idea developed here is to reconstruct an image from noisy and indirect observations by registering, via metamorphosis, a template to the observed data. Unlike a registration with only geometrical changes, this framework gives good results when intensities of the template are poorly chosen. We show that this method is a well-defined regularisation method (proving existence, stability and convergence) and present several numerical examples. 
### 59.Digging Into Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01260.pdf)
> Depth-sensing is important for both navigation and scene understanding. However, procuring RGB images with corresponding depth data for training deep models is challenging; large-scale, varied, datasets with ground truth training data are scarce. Consequently, several recent methods have proposed treating the training of monocular color-to-depth estimation networks as an image reconstruction problem, thus forgoing the need for ground truth depth. <br />There are multiple concepts and design decisions for these networks that seem sensible, but give mixed or surprising results when tested. For example, binocular stereo as the source of self-supervision seems cumbersome and hard to scale, yet results are less blurry compared to training with monocular videos. Such decisions also interplay with questions about architectures, loss functions, image scales, and motion handling. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective model, with several general architectural and loss innovations, that surpasses all other self-supervised depth estimation approaches on KITTI. 
### 60.Y-Net: Joint Segmentation and Classification for Diagnosis of Breast  Biopsy Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01313.pdf)
> In this paper, we introduce a conceptually simple network for generating discriminative tissue-level segmentation masks for the purpose of breast cancer diagnosis. Our method efficiently segments different types of tissues in breast biopsy images while simultaneously predicting a discriminative map for identifying important areas in an image. Our network, Y-Net, extends and generalizes U-Net by adding a parallel branch for discriminative map generation and by supporting convolutional block modularity, which allows the user to adjust network efficiency without altering the network topology. Y-Net delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy while learning 6.6x fewer parameters than its closest competitors. The addition of descriptive power from Y-Net's discriminative segmentation masks improve diagnostic classification accuracy by 7% over state-of-the-art methods for diagnostic classification.

### 61.Cube Padding for Weakly-Supervised Saliency Prediction in 360&#xb0;  Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01320.pdf)
> Automatic saliency prediction in 360{\deg} videos is critical for viewpoint guidance applications (e.g., Facebook 360 Guide). We propose a spatial-temporal network which is (1) weakly-supervised trained and (2) tailor-made for 360{\deg} viewing sphere. Note that most existing methods are less scalable since they rely on annotated saliency map for training. Most importantly, they convert 360{\deg} sphere to 2D images (e.g., a single equirectangular image or multiple separate Normal Field-of-View (NFoV) images) which introduces distortion and image boundaries. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective Cube Padding (CP) technique as follows. Firstly, we render the 360{\deg} view on six faces of a cube using perspective projection. Thus, it introduces very little distortion. Then, we concatenate all six faces while utilizing the connectivity between faces on the cube for image padding (i.e., Cube Padding) in convolution, pooling, convolutional LSTM layers. In this way, CP introduces no image boundary while being applicable to almost all Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structures. To evaluate our method, we propose Wild-360, a new 360{\deg} video saliency dataset, containing challenging videos with saliency heatmap annotations. In experiments, our method outperforms baseline methods in both speed and quality. 
### 62.Computing the Spatial Probability of Inclusion inside Partial Contours  for Computer Vision Applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01339.pdf)
> In Computer Vision, edge detection is one of the favored approaches for feature and object detection in images since it provides information about their objects boundaries. Other region-based approaches use probabilistic analysis such as clustering and Markov random fields, but those methods cannot be used to analyze edges and their interaction. In fact, only image segmentation can produce regions based on edges, but it requires thresholding by simply separating the regions into binary in-out information. Hence, there is currently a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms, since edges cannot be used to study the properties of a region and vice versa. The objective of this paper is to present a novel spatial probability analysis that allows determining the probability of inclusion inside a set of partial contours (strokes). To answer this objective, we developed a new approach that uses electromagnetic convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the required probabilities. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a continuous space of probability based only on the edge information, thus bridging the gap between the edge-based methods and the region-based methods. The developed method is consistent with the fundamental properties of inclusion probabilities and its results are validated by comparing an image with the probability-based estimation given by our algorithm. The method can also be generalized to take into consideration the intensity of the edges or to be used for 3D shapes. This is the first documented method that allows computing a space of probability based on interacting edges, which opens the path to broader applications such as image segmentation and contour completion. 
### 63.gprHOG: Several Simple Improvements to the Histogram of Oriented  Gradients Feature for Threat Detection in Ground-Penetrating Radar [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01349.pdf)
> The ground penetrating radar (GPR) is one of the most successful remote sensing modalities for buried threat detection (BTD). Substantial research has been devoted to the development of algorithms that automate BTD with GPR data, resulting in a large number of proposed algorithms. In this paper, we revisit the design of a recently and widely adopted algorithm based upon the popular Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature. The HOG feature was originally developed in the computer vision community, and was subsequently applied to GPR-based BTD by Torrione et al., 2012. In this work, we propose several modifications to the HOG algorithm (i.e., as used in Torrione et al., 2012) with the aim of better adapting it to the unique characteristics of GPR data. Using a large GPR dataset, and several performance metrics, we show that each one of the proposed adaptations improves algorithm performance, sometimes by a substantial margin. We refer to the final algorithm, after all adaptations are included, as "gprHOG." This paper provides greater detail and experimental justification for the design of gprHOG, which was submitted to a recently published comparison of advanced algorithms for GPR-based BTD. 
### 64.Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Classification of Prostate  Histopathology Whole-Slide Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01357.pdf)
> Automatic and accurate Gleason grading of histopathology tissue slides is crucial for prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Usually, histopathology tissue slides from different institutions show heterogeneous appearances because of different tissue preparation and staining procedures, thus the predictable model learned from one domain may not be applicable to a new domain directly. Here we propose to adopt unsupervised domain adaptation to transfer the discriminative knowledge obtained from the source domain to the target domain without requiring labeling of images at the target domain. The adaptation is achieved through adversarial training to find an invariant feature space along with the proposed Siamese architecture on the target domain to add a regularization that is appropriate for the whole-slide images. We validate the method on two prostate cancer datasets and obtain significant classification improvement of Gleason scores as compared with the baseline models. 
### 65.Factorized Adversarial Networks for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01376.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose Factorized Adversarial Networks (FAN) to solve unsupervised domain adaptation problems for image classification tasks. Our networks map the data distribution into a latent feature space, which is factorized into a domain-specific subspace that contains domain-specific characteristics and a task-specific subspace that retains category information, for both source and target domains, respectively. Unsupervised domain adaptation is achieved by adversarial training to minimize the discrepancy between the distributions of two task-specific subspaces from source and target domains. We demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets used in the literature for unsupervised domain adaptation. Furthermore, we collect two real-world tagging datasets that are much larger than existing benchmark datasets, and get significant improvement upon baselines, proving the practical value of our approach. 
### 66.Learning Scene Flow in 3D Point Clouds [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01411.pdf)
> Many applications in robotics and human-computer interaction can benefit from an understanding of 3D motion of points in a dynamic environment, widely noted as scene flow. While most previous methods focus on solving the problem with stereo and RGB-D images, few try to estimate scene flow directly from point clouds. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural network named $\textit{FlowNet3D}$ that learns scene flow from point clouds in an end-to-end fashion. Our network simultaneously learns deep hierarchical point cloud features, flow embeddings as well as how to smooth the output. We evaluate the network on both challenging synthetic data and real LiDAR scans from KITTI. Trained on synthetic data only, our network is able to generalize well to real scans. Benefited from learning directly in point clouds, our model achieved significantly more accurate scene flow results compared with various baselines on stereo images and RGB-D images. 
### 67.CFCM: Segmentation via Coarse to Fine Context Memory [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01413.pdf)
> Recent neural-network-based architectures for image segmentation make extensive usage of feature forwarding mechanisms to integrate information from multiple scales. Although yielding good results, even deeper architectures and alternative methods for feature fusion at different resolutions have been scarcely investigated for medical applications. In this work we propose to implement segmentation via an encoder-decoder architecture which differs from any other previously published method since (i) it employs a very deep architecture based on residual learning and (ii) combines features via a convolutional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), instead of concatenation or summation. The intuition is that the memory mechanism implemented by LSTMs can better integrate features from different scales through a coarse-to-fine strategy; hence the name Coarse-to-Fine Context Memory (CFCM). We demonstrate the remarkable advantages of this approach on two datasets: the Montgomery county lung segmentation dataset, and the EndoVis 2015 challenge dataset for surgical instrument segmentation. 
### 68.SoPhie: An Attentive GAN for Predicting Paths Compliant to Social and  Physical Constraints [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01482.pdf)
> We are witnessing an increasing growth of autonomous platforms such as self-driving cars and social robots around us. These mobile machines need to navigate dynamic human environments safely and in a socially acceptable way. Hence, understanding the human behavior and the physical constraints of the environment is crucial. To address the task of path prediction for multiple interacting agents in a scene, we present SoPhie; an interpretable framework based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Sophie leverages two sources of information: the past trajectory of all the agents in the scene and a wide top-view image of the navigation scene. Our approach combines a physical attention mechanism with a social attention mechanism. The physical attention component helps the model to learn where to look in a large scene and extract the most salient parts of the image relevant to the path. Whereas, the social attention component is able to aggregate information across different involved agents and extract the most important trajectory information from the surrounding agents, enabling our method to predict socially aware paths. SoPhie is able to capture the multi-modal nature of the future prediction: given the history of trajectories and a navigation scene, there can be multiple acceptable paths in the future. Through experiments on several trajectory forecasting benchmarks, we show that SoPhie outperforms prior work in terms of accuracy, while predicting physically appropriate paths. We also show that SoPhie is able to classify traversable vs non-traversable locations in a scene. 
### 69.3D Human Pose Estimation with 2D Marginal Heatmaps [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01484.pdf)
> Automatically determining three-dimensional human pose from monocular RGB image data is a challenging problem. The two-dimensional nature of the input results in intrinsic ambiguities which make inferring depth particularly difficult. Recently, researchers have demonstrated that the flexible statistical modelling capabilities of deep neural networks are sufficient to make such inferences with reasonable accuracy. However, many of these models use coordinate output techniques which are memory-intensive, not differentiable, and/or do not spatially generalise well. We propose improvements to 3D coordinate prediction which avoid the aforementioned undesirable traits by predicting 2D marginal heatmaps under an augmented soft-argmax scheme. Our resulting model, MargiPose, produces visually coherent heatmaps whilst maintaining differentiability. We are also able to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on publicly available 3D human pose estimation data. 
### 70.Construction of all-in-focus images assisted by depth sensing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01524.pdf)
> Multi-focus image fusion is a technique for obtaining an all-in-focus image in which all objects are in focus to extend the limited depth of field (DoF) of an imaging system. Different from traditional RGB-based methods, this paper presents a new multi-focus image fusion method assisted by depth sensing. In this work, a depth sensor is used together with a color camera to capture images of a scene. A graph-based segmentation algorithm is used to segment the depth map from the depth sensor, and the segmented regions are used to guide a focus algorithm to locate in-focus image blocks from among multi-focus source images to construct the reference all-in-focus image. Five test scenes and six evaluation metrics were used to compare the proposed method and representative state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results quantitatively demonstrate that this method outperforms existing methods in both speed and quality (in terms of comprehensive fusion metrics). The generated images can potentially be used as reference all-in-focus images. 
### 71.Deep Mixture of Experts via Shallow Embedding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01531.pdf)
> Larger networks generally have greater representational power at the cost of increased computational complexity. Sparsifying such networks has been an active area of research but has been generally limited to static regularization or dynamic approaches using reinforcement learning. We explore a mixture of experts (MoE) approach to deep dynamic routing, which activates certain experts in the network on a per-example basis. Our novel DeepMoE architecture increases the representational power of standard convolutional networks by adaptively sparsifying and recalibrating channel-wise features in each convolutional layer. We employ a multi-headed sparse gating network to determine the selection and scaling of channels for each input, leveraging exponential combinations of experts within a single convolutional network. Our proposed architecture is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and tasks and we show that DeepMoEs are able to achieve higher accuracy with lower computation than standard convolutional networks. 
### 72.TS-Net: Combining modality specific and common features for multimodal  patch matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01550.pdf)
> Multimodal patch matching addresses the problem of finding the correspondences between image patches from two different modalities, e.g. RGB vs sketch or RGB vs near-infrared. The comparison of patches of different modalities can be done by discovering the information common to both modalities (Siamese like approaches) or the modality-specific information (Pseudo-Siamese like approaches). We observed that none of these two scenarios is optimal. This motivates us to propose a three-stream architecture, dubbed as TS-Net, combining the benefits of the two. In addition, we show that adding extra constraints in the intermediate layers of such networks further boosts the performance. Experimentations on three multimodal datasets show significant performance gains in comparison with Siamese and Pseudo-Siamese networks. 
### 73.Adaptive Importance Learning for Improving Lightweight Image  Super-resolution Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01576.pdf)
> Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in single image super-resolution (SISR). The computing and memory requirements of these methods have hindered their application to broad classes of real devices with limited computing power, however. One approach to this problem has been lightweight network architectures that bal- ance the super-resolution performance and the computation burden. In this study, we revisit this problem from an orthog- onal view, and propose a novel learning strategy to maxi- mize the pixel-wise fitting capacity of a given lightweight network architecture. Considering that the initial capacity of the lightweight network is very limited, we present an adaptive importance learning scheme for SISR that trains the network with an easy-to-complex paradigm by dynam- ically updating the importance of image pixels on the basis of the training loss. Specifically, we formulate the network training and the importance learning into a joint optimization problem. With a carefully designed importance penalty function, the importance of individual pixels can be gradu- ally increased through solving a convex optimization problem. The training process thus begins with pixels that are easy to reconstruct, and gradually proceeds to more complex pixels as fitting improves. 
### 74.Stochastic Gradient Descent with Hyperbolic-Tangent Decay [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01593.pdf)
> Learning rate scheduler has been a critical issue in the deep neural network training. Several schedulers and methods have been proposed, including step decay scheduler, adaptive method, cosine scheduler and cyclical scheduler. This paper proposes a new scheduling method, named hyperbolic-tangent decay (HTD). We run experiments on several benchmarks such as: ResNet, Wide ResNet and DenseNet for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, LSTM for PAMAP2 dataset, ResNet on ImageNet and Fashion-MNIST datasets. In our experiments, HTD outperforms step decay and cosine scheduler in nearly all cases, while requiring less hyperparameters than step decay, and more flexible than cosine scheduler. 
### 75.Real-time Lane Marker Detection Using Template Matching with RGB-D  Camera [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01621.pdf)
> This paper addresses the problem of lane detection which is fundamental for self-driving vehicles. Our approach exploits both colour and depth information recorded by a single RGB-D camera to better deal with negative factors such as lighting conditions and lane-like objects. In the approach, colour and depth images are first converted to a half-binary format and a 2D matrix of 3D points. They are then used as the inputs of template matching and geometric feature extraction processes to form a response map so that its values represent the probability of pixels being lane markers. To further improve the results, the template and lane surfaces are finally refined by principal component analysis and lane model fitting techniques. A number of experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and real datasets. The result shows that the proposed approach can effectively eliminate unwanted noise to accurately detect lane markers in various scenarios. Moreover, the processing speed of 20 frames per second under hardware configuration of a popular laptop computer allows the proposed algorithm to be implemented for real-time autonomous driving applications. 
### 76.Recurrent Convolutional Fusion for RGB-D Object Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01673.pdf)
> Providing machines with the ability to recognize objects like humans has always been one of the primary goals of machine vision. The introduction of RGB-D cameras has paved the way for a significant leap forward in this direction thanks to the rich information provided by these sensors. However, the machine vision community still lacks an effective method to synergically use the RGB and depth data to improve object recognition. In order to take a step in this direction, we introduce a novel end-to-end architecture for RGB-D object recognition called recurrent convolutional fusion (RCFusion). Our method generates compact and highly discriminative multi-modal features by combining complementary RGB and depth information representing different levels of abstraction. Extensive experiments on two popular datasets, RGB-D Object Dataset and JHUIT-50, show that RCFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both the object categorization and instance recognition tasks. 
### 77.Practical Deep Stereo (PDS): Toward applications-friendly deep stereo  matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01677.pdf)
> End-to-end deep-learning networks recently demonstrated extremely good perfor- mance for stereo matching. However, existing networks are difficult to use for practical applications since (1) they are memory-hungry and unable to process even modest-size images, (2) they have to be trained for a given disparity range. The Practical Deep Stereo (PDS) network that we propose addresses both issues: First, its architecture relies on novel bottleneck modules that drastically reduce the memory footprint in inference, and additional design choices allow to handle greater image size during training. This results in a model that leverages large image context to resolve matching ambiguities. Second, a novel sub-pixel cross- entropy loss combined with a MAP estimator make this network less sensitive to ambiguous matches, and applicable to any disparity range without re-training. We compare PDS to state-of-the-art methods published over the recent months, and demonstrate its superior performance on FlyingThings3D and KITTI sets. 
### 78.EasyConvPooling: Random Pooling with Easy Convolution for Accelerating  Training and Testing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01729.pdf)
> Convolution operations dominate the overall execution time of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper proposes an easy yet efficient technique for both Convolutional Neural Network training and testing. The conventional convolution and pooling operations are replaced by Easy Convolution and Random Pooling (ECP). In ECP, we randomly select one pixel out of four and only conduct convolution operations of the selected pixel. As a result, only a quarter of the conventional convolution computations are needed. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EasyConvPooling can achieve 1.45x speedup on training time and 1.64x on testing time. What's more, a speedup of 5.09x on pure Easy Convolution operations is obtained compared to conventional convolution operations. 
### 79.Monte Carlo Convolution for Learning on Non-Uniformly Sampled Point  Clouds [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01759.pdf)
> We propose an efficient and effective method to learn convolutions for non-uniformly sampled point clouds, as they are obtained with modern acquisition techniques. Learning is enabled by four key novelties: first, representing the convolution kernel itself as a multilayer perceptron; second, phrasing convolution as a Monte Carlo integration problem, third, constructing an unstructured Poisson disk hierarchy for pooling, and fourth, using Monte Carlo convolution as pooling and upsampling operation at different resolutions simultaneously. The key idea across all these contributions is to guarantee adequate consideration of the underlying non-uniform sample distribution function from a Monte Carlo perspective. To make the proposed concepts applicable for real-world tasks, we furthermore propose an efficient implementation which significantly reduces the required GPU memory. By employing our method in hierarchical network architectures we can outperform most of the state-of-the-art networks on established point cloud segmentation, classification and normal estimation benchmarks. Furthermore, in contrast to most existing approaches, we can also demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to sampling variations even when only trained on uniformly sampled models. 
### 80.Graph Saliency Maps through Spectral Convolutional Networks: Application  to Sex Classification with Brain Connectivity [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01764.pdf)
> Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) allow to apply traditional convolution operations in non-Euclidean domains, where data are commonly modelled as irregular graphs. Medical imaging and, in particular, neuroscience studies often rely on such graph representations, with brain connectivity networks being a characteristic example, while ultimately seeking the locus of phenotypic or disease-related differences in the brain. These regions of interest (ROIs) are, then, considered to be closely associated with function and/or behaviour. Driven by this, we explore GCNs for the task of ROI identification and propose a visual attribution method based on class activation mapping. By undertaking a sex classification task as proof of concept, we show that this method can be used to identify salient nodes (brain regions) without prior node labels. Based on experiments conducted on neuroimaging data of more than 5000 participants from UK Biobank, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in highlighting reproducible regions across individuals. We further evaluate the neurobiological relevance of the identified regions based on evidence from large-scale UK Biobank studies. 
### 81.Videos as Space-Time Region Graphs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01810.pdf)
> How do humans recognize the action "opening a book" ? We argue that there are two important cues: modeling temporal shape dynamics and modeling functional relationships between humans and objects. In this paper, we propose to represent videos as space-time region graphs which capture these two important cues. Our graph nodes are defined by the object region proposals from different frames in a long range video. These nodes are connected by two types of relations: (i) similarity relations capturing the long range dependencies between correlated objects and (ii) spatial-temporal relations capturing the interactions between nearby objects. We perform reasoning on this graph representation via Graph Convolutional Networks. We achieve state-of-the-art results on both Charades and Something-Something datasets. Especially for Charades, we obtain a huge 4.4% gain when our model is applied in complex environments. 
### 82.Perturbative Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01817.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks are witnessing wide adoption in computer vision systems with numerous applications across a range of visual recognition tasks. Much of this progress is fueled through advances in convolutional neural network architectures and learning algorithms even as the basic premise of a convolutional layer has remained unchanged. In this paper, we seek to revisit the convolutional layer that has been the workhorse of state-of-the-art visual recognition models. We introduce a very simple, yet effective, module called a perturbation layer as an alternative to a convolutional layer. The perturbation layer does away with convolution in the traditional sense and instead computes its response as a weighted linear combination of non-linearly activated additive noise perturbed inputs. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this perturbation layer can be an effective replacement for a standard convolutional layer. Empirically, deep neural networks with perturbation layers, called Perturbative Neural Networks (PNNs), in lieu of convolutional layers perform comparably with standard CNNs on a range of visual datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, PASCAL VOC, and ImageNet) with fewer parameters. 
### 83.Focal Visual-Text Attention for Visual Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01873.pdf)
> Recent insights on language and vision with neural networks have been successfully applied to simple single-image visual question answering. However, to tackle real-life question answering problems on multimedia collections such as personal photos, we have to look at whole collections with sequences of photos or videos. When answering questions from a large collection, a natural problem is to identify snippets to support the answer. In this paper, we describe a novel neural network called Focal Visual-Text Attention network (FVTA) for collective reasoning in visual question answering, where both visual and text sequence information such as images and text metadata are presented. FVTA introduces an end-to-end approach that makes use of a hierarchical process to dynamically determine what media and what time to focus on in the sequential data to answer the question. FVTA can not only answer the questions well but also provides the justifications which the system results are based upon to get the answers. FVTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MemexQA dataset and competitive results on the MovieQA dataset. 
### 84.Performance Evaluation of Deep Learning Networks for Semantic  Segmentation of Traffic Stereo-Pair Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01896.pdf)
> Semantic image segmentation is one the most demanding task, especially for analysis of traffic conditions for self-driving cars. Here the results of application of several deep learning architectures (PSPNet and ICNet) for semantic image segmentation of traffic stereo-pair images are presented. The images from Cityscapes dataset and custom urban images were analyzed as to the segmentation accuracy and image inference time. For the models pre-trained on Cityscapes dataset, the inference time was equal in the limits of standard deviation, but the segmentation accuracy was different for various cities and stereo channels even. The distributions of accuracy (mean intersection over union - mIoU) values for each city and channel are asymmetric, long-tailed, and have many extreme outliers, especially for PSPNet network in comparison to ICNet network. Some statistical properties of these distributions (skewness, kurtosis) allow us to distinguish these two networks and open the question about relations between architecture of deep learning networks and statistical distribution of the predicted results (mIoU here). The results obtained demonstrated the different sensitivity of these networks to: (1) the local street view peculiarities in different cities that should be taken into account during the targeted fine tuning the models before their practical applications, (2) the right and left data channels in stereo-pairs. For both networks, the difference in the predicted results (mIoU here) for the right and left data channels in stereo-pairs is out of the limits of statistical error in relation to mIoU values. It means that the traffic stereo pairs can be effectively used not only for depth calculations (as it is usually used), but also as an additional data channel that can provide much more information about scene objects than simple duplication of the same street view images. 
### 85.Y-Net: A deep Convolutional Neural Network for Polyp Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01907.pdf)
> Colorectal polyps are important precursors to colon cancer, the third most common cause of cancer mortality for both men and women. It is a disease where early detection is of crucial importance. Colonoscopy is commonly used for early detection of cancer and precancerous pathology. It is a demanding procedure requiring significant amount of time from specialized physicians and nurses, in addition to a significant miss-rates of polyps by specialists. Automated polyp detection in colonoscopy videos has been demonstrated to be a promising way to handle this problem. {However, polyps detection is a challenging problem due to the availability of limited amount of training data and large appearance variations of polyps. To handle this problem, we propose a novel deep learning method Y-Net that consists of two encoder networks with a decoder network. Our proposed Y-Net method} relies on efficient use of pre-trained and un-trained models with novel sum-skip-concatenation operations. Each of the encoders are trained with encoder specific learning rate along the decoder. Compared with the previous methods employing hand-crafted features or 2-D/3-D convolutional neural network, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for polyp detection with 7.3% F1-score and 13% recall improvement. 
### 86.Adversarial Scene Editing: Automatic Object Removal from Weak  Supervision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01911.pdf)
> While great progress has been made recently in automatic image manipulation, it has been limited to object centric images like faces or structured scene datasets. In this work, we take a step towards general scene-level image editing by developing an automatic interaction-free object removal model. Our model learns to find and remove objects from general scene images using image-level labels and unpaired data in a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. We achieve this with two key contributions: a two-stage editor architecture consisting of a mask generator and image in-painter that co-operate to remove objects, and a novel GAN based prior for the mask generator that allows us to flexibly incorporate knowledge about object shapes. We experimentally show on two datasets that our method effectively removes a wide variety of objects using weak supervision only 
### 87.Exploring Feature Reuse in DenseNet Architectures [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01935.pdf)
> Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets) have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on image classification tasks while using fewer parameters and computation than competing methods. Since each layer in this architecture has full access to the feature maps of all previous layers, the network is freed from the burden of having to relearn previously useful features, thus alleviating issues with vanishing gradients. In this work we explore the question: To what extent is it necessary to connect to all previous layers in order to reap the benefits of feature reuse? To this end, we introduce the notion of local dense connectivity and present evidence that less connectivity, allowing for increased growth rate at a fixed network capacity, can achieve a more efficient reuse of features and lead to higher accuracy in dense architectures. 
### 88.Mining for meaning: from vision to language through multiple networks  consensus [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01954.pdf)
> Describing visual data into natural language is a very challenging task, at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning. Language goes well beyond the description of physical objects and their interactions and can convey the same abstract idea in many ways. It is both about content at the highest semantic level as well as about fluent form. Here we propose an approach to describe videos in natural language by reaching a consensus among multiple encoder-decoder networks. Finding such a consensual linguistic description, which shares common properties with a larger group, has a better chance to convey the correct meaning. We propose and train several network architectures and use different types of image, audio and video features. Each model produces its own description of the input video and the best one is chosen through an efficient, two-phase consensus process. We demonstrate the strength of our approach by obtaining state of the art results on the challenging MSR-VTT dataset. 
### 89.MILD-Net: Minimal Information Loss Dilated Network for Gland Instance  Segmentation in Colon Histology Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01963.pdf)
> The analysis of glandular morphology within colon histopathology images is a crucial step in determining the stage of colon cancer. Despite the importance of this task, manual segmentation is laborious, time-consuming and can suffer from subjectivity among pathologists. The rise of computational pathology has led to the development of automated methods for gland segmentation that aim to overcome the challenges of manual segmentation. However, this task is non-trivial due to the large variability in glandular appearance and the difficulty in differentiating between certain glandular and non-glandular histological structures. Furthermore, within pathological practice, a measure of uncertainty is essential for diagnostic decision making. For example, ambiguous areas may require further examination from numerous pathologists. To address these challenges, we propose a fully convolutional neural network that counters the loss of information caused by max-pooling by re-introducing the original image at multiple points within the network. We also use atrous spatial pyramid pooling with varying dilation rates for resolution maintenance and multi-level aggregation. To incorporate uncertainty, we introduce random transformations during test time for an enhanced segmentation result that simultaneously generates an uncertainty map, highlighting areas of ambiguity. We show that this map can be used to define a metric for disregarding predictions with high uncertainty. The proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GlaS challenge dataset, as part of MICCAI 2015, and on a second independent colorectal adenocarcinoma dataset. 
### 90.Normalized Cut with Adaptive Similarity and Spatial Regularization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01977.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a normalized cut segmentation algorithm with spatial regularization priority and adaptive similarity matrix. We integrate the well-known expectation-maximum(EM) method in statistics and the regularization technique in partial differential equation (PDE) method into normalized cut (Ncut). The introduced EM technique makes our method can adaptively update the similarity matrix, which can help us to get a better classification criterion than the classical Ncut method. While the regularization priority can guarantee the proposed algorithm has a robust performance under noise. To unify the three totally different methods including EM, spatial regularization, and spectral graph clustering, we built a variational framework to combine them and get a general normalized cut segmentation algorithm. The well-defined theory of the proposed model is also given in the paper. Compared with some existing spectral clustering methods such as the traditional Ncut algorithm and the variational based Chan-Vese model, the numerical experiments show that our methods can achieve promising segmentation performance. 
### 91.Robust Structured Multi-task Multi-view Sparse Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01985.pdf)
> Sparse representation is a viable solution to visual tracking. In this paper, we propose a structured multi-task multi-view tracking (SMTMVT) method, which exploits the sparse appearance model in the particle filter framework to track targets under different challenges. Specifically, we extract features of the target candidates from different views and sparsely represent them by a linear combination of templates of different views. Unlike the conventional sparse trackers, SMTMVT not only jointly considers the relationship between different tasks and different views but also retains the structures among different views in a robust multi-task multi-view formulation. We introduce a numerical algorithm based on the proximal gradient method to quickly and effectively find the sparsity by dividing the optimization problem into two subproblems with the closed-form solutions. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the benchmark of challenging image sequences demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed tracker against various state-of-the-art trackers. 
### 92.Joint Estimation of Age and Gender from Unconstrained Face Images using  Lightweight Multi-task CNN for Mobile Applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02023.pdf)
> Automatic age and gender classification based on unconstrained images has become essential techniques on mobile devices. With limited computing power, how to develop a robust system becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we present an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) called lightweight multi-task CNN for simultaneous age and gender classification. Lightweight multi-task CNN uses depthwise separable convolution to reduce the model size and save the inference time. On the public challenging Adience dataset, the accuracy of age and gender classification is better than baseline multi-task CNN methods. 
### 93.Real-time Surgical Tools Recognition in Total Knee Arthroplasty Using  Deep Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02031.pdf)
> Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a commonly performed surgical procedure to mitigate knee pain and improve functions for people with knee arthritis. The procedure is complicated due to the different surgical tools used in the stages of surgery. The recognition of surgical tools in real-time can be a solution to simplify surgical procedures for the surgeon. Also, the presence and movement of tools in surgery are crucial information for the recognition of the operational phase and to identify the surgical workflow. Therefore, this research proposes the development of a real-time system for the recognition of surgical tools during surgery using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Surgeons wearing smart glasses can see essential information about tools during surgery that may reduce the complication of the procedures. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we calculated and compared the Mean Average Precision (MAP) with state-of-the-art methods which are fast R-CNN and deformable part models (DPM). We achieved 87.6% mAP which is better in comparison to the existing methods. With the additional improvements of our proposed method, it can be a future point of reference, also the baseline for operational phase recognition. 
### 94.Is the winner really the best? A critical analysis of common research  practice in biomedical image analysis competitions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02051.pdf)
> International challenges have become the standard for validation of biomedical image analysis methods. Given their scientific impact, it is surprising that a critical analysis of common practices related to the organization of challenges has not yet been performed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of biomedical image analysis challenges conducted up to now. We demonstrate the importance of challenges and show that the lack of quality control has critical consequences. First, reproducibility and interpretation of the results is often hampered as only a fraction of relevant information is typically provided. Second, the rank of an algorithm is generally not robust to a number of variables such as the test data used for validation, the ranking scheme applied and the observers that make the reference annotations. To overcome these problems, we recommend best practice guidelines and define open research questions to be addressed in the future. 
### 95.PieAPP: Perceptual Image-Error Assessment through Pairwise Preference [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02067.pdf)
> The ability to estimate the perceptual error between images is an important problem in computer vision with many applications. Although it has been studied extensively, however, no method currently exists that can robustly predict visual differences like humans. Some previous approaches used hand-coded models, but they fail to model the complexity of the human visual system. Others used machine learning to train models on human-labeled datasets, but creating large, high-quality datasets is difficult because people are unable to assign consistent error labels to distorted images. In this paper, we present a new learning-based method that is the first to predict perceptual image error like human observers. Since it is much easier for people to compare two given images and identify the one more similar to a reference than to assign quality scores to each, we propose a new, large-scale dataset labeled with the probability that humans will prefer one image over another. We then train a deep-learning model using a novel, pairwise-learning framework to predict the preference of one distorted image over the other. Our key observation is that our trained network can then be used separately with only one distorted image and a reference to predict its perceptual error, without ever being trained on explicit human perceptual-error labels. The perceptual error estimated by our new metric, PieAPP, is well-correlated with human opinion. Furthermore, it significantly outperforms existing algorithms, beating the state-of-the-art by almost 3x on our test set in terms of binary error rate, while also generalizing to new kinds of distortions, unlike previous learning-based methods. 
### 96.Instance Segmentation and Tracking with Cosine Embeddings and Recurrent  Hourglass Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02070.pdf)
> Different to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation assigns unique labels to each individual instance of the same class. In this work, we propose a novel recurrent fully convolutional network architecture for tracking such instance segmentations over time. The network architecture incorporates convolutional gated recurrent units (ConvGRU) into a stacked hourglass network to utilize temporal video information. Furthermore, we train the network with a novel embedding loss based on cosine similarities, such that the network predicts unique embeddings for every instance throughout videos. Afterwards, these embeddings are clustered among subsequent video frames to create the final tracked instance segmentations. We evaluate the recurrent hourglass network by segmenting left ventricles in MR videos of the heart, where it outperforms a network that does not incorporate video information. Furthermore, we show applicability of the cosine embedding loss for segmenting leaf instances on still images of plants. Finally, we evaluate the framework for instance segmentation and tracking on six datasets of the ISBI celltracking challenge, where it shows state-of-the-art performance. 
### 97.TextRay: Mining Clinical Reports to Gain a Broad Understanding of Chest  X-rays [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02121.pdf)
> The chest X-ray (CXR) is by far the most commonly performed radiological examination for screening and diagnosis of many cardiac and pulmonary diseases. There is an immense world-wide shortage of physicians capable of providing rapid and accurate interpretation of this study. A radiologist-driven analysis of over two million CXR reports generated an ontology including the 40 most prevalent pathologies on CXR. By manually tagging a relatively small set of sentences, we were able to construct a training set of 959k studies. A deep learning model was trained to predict the findings given the patient frontal and lateral scans. For 12 of the findings we compare the model performance against a team of radiologists and show that in most cases the radiologists agree on average more with the algorithm than with each other. 
### 98.Deep supervision with additional labels for retinal vessel segmentation  task [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02132.pdf)
> Automatic analysis of retinal blood images is of vital importance in diagnosis tasks of retinopathy. Segmenting vessels accurately is a fundamental step in analysing retinal images. However, it is usually difficult due to various imaging conditions, low image contrast and the appearance of pathologies such as micro-aneurysms. In this paper, we propose a novel method with deep neural networks to solve this problem. We utilize U-net with residual connection to detect vessels. To achieve better accuracy, we introduce an edge-aware mechanism, in which we convert the original task into a multi-class task by adding additional labels on boundary areas. In this way, the network will pay more attention to the boundary areas of vessels and achieve a better performance, especially in tiny vessels detecting. Besides, side output layers are applied in order to give deep supervision and therefore help convergence. We train and evaluate our model on three databases: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASEDB1. Experimental results show that our method has a comparable performance with AUC of 97.99% on DRIVE and an efficient running time compared to the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 99.Multi-chart Generative Surface Modeling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02143.pdf)
> This paper introduces a 3D shape generative model based on deep neural networks. A new image-like (i.e., tensor) data representation for genus-zero 3D shapes is devised. It is based on the observation that complicated shapes can be well represented by multiple parameterizations (charts), each focusing on a different part of the shape. The new tensor data representation is used as input to Generative Adversarial Networks for the task of 3D shape generation. The 3D shape tensor representation is based on a multi-chart structure that enjoys a shape covering property and scale-translation rigidity. Scale-translation rigidity facilitates high quality 3D shape learning and guarantees unique reconstruction. The multi-chart structure uses as input a dataset of 3D shapes (with arbitrary connectivity) and a sparse correspondence between them. The output of our algorithm is a generative model that learns the shape distribution and is able to generate novel shapes, interpolate shapes, and explore the generated shape space. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated for the task of anatomic shape generation including human body and bone (teeth) shape generation. 
### 100.PointFlowNet: Learning Representations for 3D Scene Flow Estimation from  Point Clouds [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02170.pdf)
> Despite significant progress in image-based 3D scene flow estimation, the performance of such approaches has not yet reached the fidelity required by many applications. Simultaneously, these applications are often not restricted to image-based estimation: laser scanners provide a popular alternative to traditional cameras, for example in the context of self-driving cars, as they directly yield a 3D point cloud. In this paper, we propose to estimate 3D scene flow from such unstructured point clouds using a deep neural network. In a single forward pass, our model jointly predicts 3D scene flow as well as the 3D bounding box and rigid body motion of objects in the scene. While the prospect of estimating 3D scene flow from unstructured point clouds is promising, it is also a challenging task. We show that the traditional global representation of rigid body motion prohibits inference by CNNs, and propose a translation equivariant representation to circumvent this problem. For training our deep network, a large dataset is required. Because of this, we augment real scans from KITTI with virtual objects, realistically modeling occlusions and simulating sensor noise. A thorough comparison with classic and learning-based techniques highlights the robustness of the proposed approach. 
### 101.A multi-scale pyramid of 3D fully convolutional networks for abdominal  multi-organ segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02237.pdf)
> Recent advances in deep learning, like 3D fully convolutional networks (FCNs), have improved the state-of-the-art in dense semantic segmentation of medical images. However, most network architectures require severely downsampling or cropping the images to meet the memory limitations of today's GPU cards while still considering enough context in the images for accurate segmentation. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes auto-context to perform semantic segmentation at higher resolutions in a multi-scale pyramid of stacked 3D FCNs. We train and validate our models on a dataset of manually annotated abdominal organs and vessels from 377 clinical CT images used in gastric surgery, and achieve promising results with close to 90% Dice score on average. For additional evaluation, we perform separate testing on datasets from different sources and achieve competitive results, illustrating the robustness of the model and approach. 
### 102.Deep Vessel Segmentation By Learning Graphical Connectivity [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02279.pdf)
> We propose a novel deep-learning-based system for vessel segmentation. Existing methods using CNNs have mostly relied on local appearances learned on the regular image grid, without considering the graphical structure of vessel shape. To address this, we incorporate a graph convolutional network into a unified CNN architecture, where the final segmentation is inferred by combining the different types of features. The proposed method can be applied to expand any type of CNN-based vessel segmentation method to enhance the performance. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on two retinal image datasets as well as a coronary artery X-ray angiography dataset. 
### 103.Spatiotemporal Manifold Prediction Model for Anterior Vertebral Body  Growth Modulation Surgery in Idiopathic Scoliosis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02285.pdf)
> Anterior Vertebral Body Growth Modulation (AVBGM) is a minimally invasive surgical technique that gradually corrects spine deformities while preserving lumbar motion. However the selection of potential surgical patients is currently based on clinical judgment and would be facilitated by the identification of patients responding to AVBGM prior to surgery. We introduce a statistical framework for predicting the surgical outcomes following AVBGM in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. A discriminant manifold is first constructed to maximize the separation between responsive and non-responsive groups of patients treated with AVBGM for scoliosis. The model then uses subject-specific correction trajectories based on articulated transformations in order to map spine correction profiles to a group-average piecewise-geodesic path. Spine correction trajectories are described in a piecewise-geodesic fashion to account for varying times at follow-up exams, regressing the curve via a quadratic optimization process. To predict the evolution of correction, a baseline reconstruction is projected onto the manifold, from which a spatiotemporal regression model is built from parallel transport curves inferred from neighboring exemplars. The model was trained on 438 reconstructions and tested on 56 subjects using 3D spine reconstructions from follow-up exams, with the probabilistic framework yielding accurate results with differences of 2.1 +/- 0.6deg in main curve angulation, and generating models similar to biomechanical simulations. 
### 104.Regularization by Denoising: Clarifications and New Interpretations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02296.pdf)
> Regularization by Denoising (RED), as recently proposed by Romano, Elad, and Milanfar, is powerful image-recovery framework that aims to minimize an explicit regularization objective constructed from a plug-in image-denoising function. Experimental evidence suggests that the RED algorithms are state-of-the-art. We claim, however, that explicit regularization does not explain the RED algorithms. In particular, we show that many of the expressions in the paper by Romano et al. hold only when the denoiser has a symmetric Jacobian, and we demonstrate that such symmetry does not occur with practical denoisers such as non-local means, BM3D, TNRD, and DnCNN. To explain the RED algorithms, we propose a new framework called Score-Matching by Denoising (SMD), which aims to match a "score" (i.e., the gradient of a log-prior). We then show tight connections between SMD, kernel density estimation, and constrained minimum mean-squared error denoising. Furthermore, we provide new interpretations of the RED algorithms from Romano et al., and we propose novel RED algorithms with faster convergence. Finally, we show that the RED algorithms seek a consensus equilibrium solution, which facilitates a comparison to plug-and-play ADMM. 
### 105.DPatch: Attacking Object Detectors with Adversarial Patches [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02299.pdf)
> Object detectors have witnessed great progress in recent years and have been widely deployed in various important real-world scenarios, such as autonomous driving and face recognition. Therefore, it is increasingly vital to investigate the vulnerability of modern object detectors to different types of attacks. In this work, we demonstrate that actually many mainstream detectors (e.g. Faster R-CNN) can be hacked by a tiny adversarial patch. It is a non-trivial task since the original adversarial patch method can only be applied to image-level classifiers and is not capable to deal with the region proposals involved in modern detectors. Instead, here we iteratively evolve a tiny patch inside the input image so that it invalidates both proposal generation and the subsequent region classification of Faster R-CNN, resulting in a successful attack. Specifically, the proposed adversarial patch (namely, DPatch) can be trained toward any targeted class so that all the objects in any region of the scene will be classified as that targeted class. One interesting observation is that the efficiency of DPatch is not influenced by its location: no matter where it resides, the patch can always invalidate RCNN after the same amount of iterations. Furthermore, we find that different target classes have different degrees of vulnerability; and an DPatch with a larger size can perform the attack more effectively. Extensive experiments show that our DPatch can reduce the mAP of a state-of-the-art detector on PASCAL VOC 2012 from 71% to 25% and below. 
### 106.Dilatation of Lateral Ventricles with Brain Volumes in Infants with 3D  Transfontanelle US [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02305.pdf)
> Ultrasound (US) can be used to assess brain development in newborns, as MRI is challenging due to immobilization issues, and may require sedation. Dilatation of the lateral ventricles in the brain is a risk factor for poorer neurodevelopment outcomes in infants. Hence, 3D US has the ability to assess the volume of the lateral ventricles similar to clinically standard MRI, but manual segmentation is time consuming. The objective of this study is to develop an approach quantifying the ratio of lateral ventricular dilatation with respect to total brain volume using 3D US, which can assess the severity of macrocephaly. Automatic segmentation of the lateral ventricles is achieved with a multi-atlas deformable registration approach using locally linear correlation metrics for US-MRI fusion, followed by a refinement step using deformable mesh models. Total brain volume is estimated using a 3D ellipsoid modeling approach. Validation was performed on a cohort of 12 infants, ranging from 2 to 8.5 months old, where 3D US and MRI were used to compare brain volumes and segmented lateral ventricles. Automatically extracted volumes from 3D US show a high correlation and no statistically significant difference when compared to ground truth measurements. Differences in volume ratios was 6.0 +/- 4.8% compared to MRI, while lateral ventricular segmentation yielded a mean Dice coefficient of 70.8 +/- 3.6% and a mean absolute distance (MAD) of 0.88 +/- 0.2mm, demonstrating the clinical benefit of this tool in paediatric ultrasound. 
### 107.Unsupervised Attention-guided Image to Image Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02311.pdf)
> Current unsupervised image-to-image translation techniques struggle to focus their attention on individual objects without altering the background or the way multiple objects interact within a scene. Motivated by the important role of attention in human perception, we tackle this limitation by introducing unsupervised attention mechanisms that are jointly adversarialy trained with the generators and discriminators. We demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that our approach is able to attend to relevant regions in the image without requiring supervision, and that by doing so it achieves more realistic mappings compared to recent approaches. 
### 108.Adaptive feature recombination and recalibration for semantic  segmentation: application to brain tumor segmentation in MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02318.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used for brain tumor segmentation, specifically, fully convolutional networks (FCNs). FCNs can segment a set of voxels at once, having a direct spatial correspondence between units in feature maps (FMs) at a given location and the corresponding classified voxels. In convolutional layers, FMs are merged to create new FMs, so, channel combination is crucial. However, not all FMs have the same relevance for a given class. Recently, in classification problems, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks have been proposed to re-calibrate FMs as a whole, and suppress the less informative ones. However, this is not optimal in FCN due to the spatial correspondence between units and voxels. In this article, we propose feature recombination through linear expansion and compression to create more complex features for semantic segmentation. Additionally, we propose a segmentation SE (SegSE) block for feature recalibration that collects contextual information, while maintaining the spatial meaning. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods in brain tumor segmentation, using publicly available data. 
### 109.Fast and Accurate Online Video Object Segmentation via Tracking Parts [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02323.pdf)
> Online video object segmentation is a challenging task as it entails to process the image sequence timely and accurately. To segment a target object through the video, numerous CNN-based methods have been developed by heavily finetuning on the object mask in the first frame, which is time-consuming for online applications. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate video object segmentation algorithm that can immediately start the segmentation process once receiving the images. We first utilize a part-based tracking method to deal with challenging factors such as large deformation, occlusion, and cluttered background. Based on the tracked bounding boxes of parts, we construct a region-of-interest segmentation network to generate part masks. Finally, a similarity-based scoring function is adopted to refine these object parts by comparing them to the visual information in the first frame. Our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy on the DAVIS benchmark dataset, while achieving much faster runtime performance. 
### 110.Spatial Frequency Loss for Learning Convolutional Autoencoders [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02336.pdf)
> This paper presents a learning method for convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) for extracting features from images. CAEs can be obtained by utilizing convolutional neural networks to learn an approximation to the identity function in an unsupervised manner. The loss function based on the pixel loss (PL) that is the mean squared error between the pixel values of original and reconstructed images is the common choice for learning. However, using the loss function leads to blurred reconstructed images. A method for learning CAEs using a loss function computed from features reflecting spatial frequencies is proposed to mitigate the problem. The blurs in reconstructed images show lack of high spatial frequency components mainly constituting edges and detailed textures that are important features for tasks such as object detection and spatial matching. In order to evaluate the lack of components, a convolutional layer with a Laplacian filter bank as weights is added to CAEs and the mean squared error of features in a subband, called the spatial frequency loss (SFL), is computed from the outputs of each filter. The learning is performed using a loss function based on the SFL. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that using the SFL reduces the blurs in reconstructed images. 
### 111.A Comparative Study on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Approaches for  Coffee Crop Mapping [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02400.pdf)
> In this work, we investigate the application of existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches to the task of transferring knowledge between crop regions having different coffee patterns. Given a geographical region with fully mapped coffee plantations, we observe that this knowledge can be used to train a classifier and to map a new county with no need of samples indicated in the target region. Experimental results show that transferring knowledge via some UDA strategies performs better than just applying a classifier trained in a region to predict coffee crops in a new one. However, UDA methods may lead to negative transfer, which may indicate that domains are too different that transferring knowledge is not appropriate. We also verify that normalization affect significantly some UDA methods; we observe a meaningful complementary contribution between coffee crops data; and a visual behavior suggests an existent of a cluster of samples that are more likely to be drawn from a specific data. 
### 112.Action4D: Real-time Action Recognition in the Crowd and Clutter [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02424.pdf)
> Recognizing every person's action in a crowded and cluttered environment is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a real-time action recognition method, Action4D, which gives reliable and accurate results in the real-world settings. We propose to tackle the action recognition problem using a holistic 4D "scan" of a cluttered scene to include every detail about the people and environment. Recognizing multiple people's actions in the cluttered 4D representation is a new problem. In this paper, we propose novel methods to solve this problem. We propose a new method to track people in 4D, which can reliably detect and follow each person in real time. We propose a new deep neural network, the Action4D-Net, to recognize the action of each tracked person. The Action4D-Net's novel structure uses both the global feature and the focused attention to achieve state-of-the-art result. Our real-time method is invariant to camera view angles, resistant to clutter and able to handle crowd. The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast, reliable and accurate. Our method paves the way to action recognition in the real-world applications and is ready to be deployed to enable smart homes, smart factories and smart stores. 
### 113.Deep Ordinal Regression Network for Monocular Depth Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02446.pdf)
> Monocular depth estimation, which plays a crucial role in understanding 3D scene geometry, is an ill-posed problem. Recent methods have gained significant improvement by exploring image-level information and hierarchical features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). These methods model depth estimation as a regression problem and train the regression networks by minimizing mean squared error, which suffers from slow convergence and unsatisfactory local solutions. Besides, existing depth estimation networks employ repeated spatial pooling operations, resulting in undesirable low-resolution feature maps. To obtain high-resolution depth maps, skip-connections or multi-layer deconvolution networks are required, which complicates network training and consumes much more computations. To eliminate or at least largely reduce these problems, we introduce a spacing-increasing discretization (SID) strategy to discretize depth and recast depth network learning as an ordinal regression problem. By training the network using an ordinary regression loss, our method achieves much higher accuracy and \dd{faster convergence in synch}. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-scale network structure which avoids unnecessary spatial pooling and captures multi-scale information in parallel. <br />The method described in this paper achieves state-of-the-art results on four challenging benchmarks, i.e., KITTI [17], ScanNet [9], Make3D [50], and NYU Depth v2 [42], and win the 1st prize in Robust Vision Challenge 2018.

### 114.NumtaDB - Assembled Bengali Handwritten Digits [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02452.pdf)
> To benchmark Bengali digit recognition algorithms, a large publicly available dataset is required which is free from biases originating from geographical location, gender, and age. With this aim in mind, NumtaDB, a dataset consisting of more than 85,000 images of hand-written Bengali digits, has been assembled. This paper documents the collection and curation process of numerals along with the salient statistics of the dataset. 
### 115.Progressive Reasoning by Module Composition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02453.pdf)
> Humans learn to solve tasks of increasing complexity by building on top of previously acquired knowledge. Typically, there exists a natural progression in the tasks that we learn - most do not require completely independent solutions, but can be broken down into simpler subtasks. We propose to represent a solver for each task as a neural module that calls existing modules (solvers for simpler tasks) in a program-like manner. Lower modules are a black box to the calling module, and communicate only via a query and an output. Thus, a module for a new task learns to query existing modules and composes their outputs in order to produce its own output. Each module also contains a residual component that learns to solve aspects of the new task that lower modules cannot solve. Our model effectively combines previous skill-sets, does not suffer from forgetting, and is fully differentiable. We test our model in learning a set of visual reasoning tasks, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in Visual Question Answering, the highest-level task in our task set. By evaluating the reasoning process using non-expert human judges, we show that our model is more interpretable than an attention-based baseline. 
### 116.Interlinked Convolutional Neural Networks for Face Parsing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02479.pdf)
> Face parsing is a basic task in face image analysis. It amounts to labeling each pixel with appropriate facial parts such as eyes and nose. In the paper, we present a interlinked convolutional neural network (iCNN) for solving this problem in an end-to-end fashion. It consists of multiple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) taking input in different scales. A special interlinking layer is designed to allow the CNNs to exchange information, enabling them to integrate local and contextual information efficiently. The hallmark of iCNN is the extensive use of downsampling and upsampling in the interlinking layers, while traditional CNNs usually uses downsampling only. A two-stage pipeline is proposed for face parsing and both stages use iCNN. The first stage localizes facial parts in the size-reduced image and the second stage labels the pixels in the identified facial parts in the original image. On a benchmark dataset we have obtained better results than the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 117.Information-Maximizing Sampling to Promote Tracking-by-Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02523.pdf)
> The performance of an adaptive tracking-by-detection algorithm not only depends on the classification and updating processes but also on the sampling. Typically, such trackers select their samples from the vicinity of the last predicted object location, or from its expected location using a pre-defined motion model, which does not exploit the contents of the samples nor the information provided by the classifier. We introduced the idea of most informative sampling, in which the sampler attempts to select samples that trouble the classifier of a discriminative tracker. We then proposed an active discriminative co-tracker that embed an adversarial sampler to increase its robustness against various tracking challenges. Experiments show that our proposed tracker outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on various benchmark videos. 
### 118.Shape Robust Text Detection with Progressive Scale Expansion Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02559.pdf)
> The challenges of shape robust text detection lie in two aspects: 1) most existing quadrangular bounding box based detectors are difficult to locate texts with arbitrary shapes, which are hard to be enclosed perfectly in a rectangle; 2) most pixel-wise segmentation-based detectors may not separate the text instances that are very close to each other. To address these problems, we propose a novel Progressive Scale Expansion Network (PSENet), designed as a segmentation-based detector with multiple predictions for each text instance. These predictions correspond to different `kernels' produced by shrinking the original text instance into various scales. Consequently, the final detection can be conducted through our progressive scale expansion algorithm which gradually expands the kernels with minimal scales to the text instances with maximal and complete shapes. Due to the fact that there are large geometrical margins among these minimal kernels, our method is effective to distinguish the adjacent text instances and is robust to arbitrary shapes. The state-of-the-art results on ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR 2017 MLT benchmarks further confirm the great effectiveness of PSENet. Notably, PSENet outperforms the previous best record by absolute 6.37\% on the curve text dataset SCUT-CTW1500. Code will be available in <a href="https://github.com/whai362/PSENet.">this https URL</a> 
### 119.On the Effect of Inter-observer Variability for a Reliable Estimation of  Uncertainty of Medical Image Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02562.pdf)
> Uncertainty estimation methods are expected to improve the understanding and quality of computer-assisted methods used in medical applications (e.g., neurosurgical interventions, radiotherapy planning), where automated medical image segmentation is crucial. In supervised machine learning, a common practice to generate ground truth label data is to merge observer annotations. However, as many medical image tasks show a high inter-observer variability resulting from factors such as image quality, different levels of user expertise and domain knowledge, little is known as to how inter-observer variability and commonly used fusion methods affect the estimation of uncertainty of automated image segmentation. In this paper we analyze the effect of common image label fusion techniques on uncertainty estimation, and propose to learn the uncertainty among observers. The results highlight the negative effect of fusion methods applied in deep learning, to obtain reliable estimates of segmentation uncertainty. Additionally, we show that the learned observers' uncertainty can be combined with current standard Monte Carlo dropout Bayesian neural networks to characterize uncertainty of model's parameters. 
### 120.Learning Multi-Modal Self-Awareness Models for Autonomous Vehicles from  Human Driving [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02609.pdf)
> This paper presents a novel approach for learning self-awareness models for autonomous vehicles. The proposed technique is based on the availability of synchronized multi-sensor dynamic data related to different maneuvering tasks performed by a human operator. It is shown that different machine learning approaches can be used to first learn single modality models using coupled Dynamic Bayesian Networks; such models are then correlated at event level to discover contextual multi-modal concepts. In the presented case, visual perception and localization are used as modalities. Cross-correlations among modalities in time is discovered from data and are described as probabilistic links connecting shared and private multi-modal DBNs at the event (discrete) level. Results are presented on experiments performed on an autonomous vehicle, highlighting potentiality of the proposed approach to allow anomaly detection and autonomous decision making based on learned self-awareness models. 
### 121.Dimensionality-Driven Learning with Noisy Labels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02612.pdf)
> Datasets with significant proportions of noisy (incorrect) class labels present challenges for training accurate Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We propose a new perspective for understanding DNN generalization for such datasets, by investigating the dimensionality of the deep representation subspace of training samples. We show that from a dimensionality perspective, DNNs exhibit quite distinctive learning styles when trained with clean labels versus when trained with a proportion of noisy labels. Based on this finding, we develop a new dimensionality-driven learning strategy, which monitors the dimensionality of subspaces during training and adapts the loss function accordingly. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is highly tolerant to significant proportions of noisy labels, and can effectively learn low-dimensional local subspaces that capture the data distribution. 
### 122.Nonparametric Density Flows for MRI Intensity Normalisation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02613.pdf)
> With the adoption of powerful machine learning methods in medical image analysis, it is becoming increasingly desirable to aggregate data that is acquired across multiple sites. However, the underlying assumption of many analysis techniques that corresponding tissues have consistent intensities in all images is often violated in multi-centre databases. We introduce a novel intensity normalisation scheme based on density matching, wherein the histograms are modelled as Dirichlet process Gaussian mixtures. The source mixture model is transformed to minimise its $L^2$ divergence towards a target model, then the voxel intensities are transported through a mass-conserving flow to maintain agreement with the moving density. In a multi-centre study with brain MRI data, we show that the proposed technique produces excellent correspondence between the matched densities and histograms. We further demonstrate that our method makes tissue intensity statistics substantially more compatible between images than a baseline affine transformation and is comparable to state-of-the-art while providing considerably smoother transformations. Finally, we validate that nonlinear intensity normalisation is a step toward effective imaging data harmonisation. 
### 123.Super-Resolution using Convolutional Neural Networks without Any  Checkerboard Artifacts [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02658.pdf)
> It is well-known that a number of excellent super-resolution (SR) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generate checkerboard artifacts. A condition to avoid the checkerboard artifacts is proposed in this paper. So far, checkerboard artifacts have been mainly studied for linear multirate systems, but the condition to avoid checkerboard artifacts can not be applied to CNNs due to the non-linearity of CNNs. We extend the avoiding condition for CNNs, and apply the proposed structure to some typical SR methods to confirm the effectiveness of the new scheme. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed structure can perfectly avoid to generate checkerboard artifacts under two loss conditions: mean square error and perceptual loss, while keeping excellent properties that the SR methods have. 
### 124.Probabilistic AND-OR Attribute Grouping for Zero-Shot Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02664.pdf)
> In zero-shot learning (ZSL), a classifier is trained to recognize visual classes without any image samples. Instead, it is given semantic information about the class, like a textual description or a set of attributes. Learning from attributes could benefit from explicitly modeling structure of the attribute space. Unfortunately, learning of general structure from empirical samples is hard with typical dataset sizes. <br />Here we describe LAGO, a probabilistic model designed to capture natural soft and-or relations across groups of attributes. We show how this model can be learned end-to-end with a deep attribute-detection model. The soft group structure can be learned from data jointly as part of the model, and can also readily incorporate prior knowledge about groups if available. The soft and-or structure succeeds to capture meaningful and predictive structures, improving the accuracy of zero-shot learning on two of three benchmarks. <br />Finally, LAGO reveals a unified formulation over two ZSL approaches: DAP (Lampert et al., 2009) and ESZSL (Romera-Paredes &amp; Torr, 2015). Interestingly, taking only one singleton group for each attribute, introduces a new soft-relaxation of DAP, that outperforms DAP by ~40. 
### 125.Transfer Learning for Illustration Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02682.pdf)
> The field of image classification has shown an outstanding success thanks to the development of deep learning techniques. Despite the great performance obtained, most of the work has focused on natural images ignoring other domains like artistic depictions. In this paper, we use transfer learning techniques to propose a new classification network with better performance in illustration images. Starting from the deep convolutional network VGG19, pre-trained with natural images, we propose two novel models which learn object representations in the new domain. Our optimized network will learn new low-level features of the images (colours, edges, textures) while keeping the knowledge of the objects and shapes that it already learned from the ImageNet dataset. Thus, requiring much less data for the training. We propose a novel dataset of illustration images labelled by content where our optimized architecture achieves $\textbf{86.61\%}$ of top-1 and $\textbf{97.21\%}$ of top-5 precision. We additionally demonstrate that our model is still able to recognize objects in photographs. 
### 126.Efficient semantic image segmentation with superpixel pooling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02705.pdf)
> In this work, we evaluate the use of superpixel pooling layers in deep network architectures for semantic segmentation. Superpixel pooling is a flexible and efficient replacement for other pooling strategies that incorporates spatial prior information. We propose a simple and efficient GPU-implementation of the layer and explore several designs for the integration of the layer into existing network architectures. We provide experimental results on the IBSR and Cityscapes dataset, demonstrating that superpixel pooling can be leveraged to consistently increase network accuracy with minimal computational overhead.

### 127.Speaker-Follower Models for Vision-and-Language Navigation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02724.pdf)
> Navigation guided by natural language instructions presents a challenging reasoning problem for instruction followers. Natural language instructions typically identify only a few high-level decisions and landmarks rather than complete low-level motor behaviors; much of the missing information must be inferred based on perceptual context. In machine learning settings, this presents a double challenge: it is difficult to collect enough annotated data to enable learning of this reasoning process from scratch, and empirically difficult to implement the reasoning process using generic sequence models. Here we describe an approach to vision-and-language navigation that addresses both these issues with an embedded speaker model. We use this speaker model to synthesize new instructions for data augmentation and to implement pragmatic reasoning for evaluating candidate action sequences. Both steps are supported by a panoramic action space that reflects the granularity of human-generated instructions. Experiments show that all three pieces of this approach---speaker-driven data augmentation, pragmatic reasoning and panoramic action space---dramatically improve the performance of a baseline instruction follower, more than doubling the success rate over the best existing approach on a standard benchmark. 
### 128.Evaluating surgical skills from kinematic data using convolutional  neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02750.pdf)
> The need for automatic surgical skills assessment is increasing, especially because manual feedback from senior surgeons observing junior surgeons is prone to subjectivity and time consuming. Thus, automating surgical skills evaluation is a very important step towards improving surgical practice. In this paper, we designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to evaluate surgeon skills by extracting patterns in the surgeon motions performed in robotic surgery. The proposed method is validated on the JIGSAWS dataset and achieved very competitive results with 100% accuracy on the suturing and needle passing tasks. While we leveraged from the CNNs efficiency, we also managed to mitigate its black-box effect using class activation map. This feature allows our method to automatically highlight which parts of the surgical task influenced the skill prediction and can be used to explain the classification and to provide personalized feedback to the trainee. 
### 129.Model-based active learning to detect isometric deformable objects in  the wild with deep architectures [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02850.pdf)
> In the recent past, algorithms based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant milestones in object recognition. With large examples of each object class, standard datasets train well for inter-class variability. However, gathering sufficient data to train for a particular instance of an object within a class is impractical. Furthermore, quantitatively assessing the imaging conditions for each image in a given dataset is not feasible. By generating sufficient images with known imaging conditions, we study to what extent CNNs can cope with hard imaging conditions for instance-level recognition in an active learning regime. <br />Leveraging powerful rendering techniques to achieve instance-level detection, we present results of training three state-of-the-art object detection algorithms namely, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN and YOLO9000, for hard imaging conditions imposed into the scene by rendering. Our extensive experiments produce a mean Average Precision score of 0.92 on synthetic images and 0.83 on real images using the best performing Faster R-CNN. We show for the first time how well detection algorithms based on deep architectures fare for each hard imaging condition studied. 
### 130.In Ictu Oculi: Exposing AI Generated Fake Face Videos by Detecting Eye  Blinking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02877.pdf)
> The new developments in deep generative networks have significantly improve the quality and efficiency in generating realistically-looking fake face videos. In this work, we describe a new method to expose fake face videos generated with neural networks. Our method is based on detection of eye blinking in the videos, which is a physiological signal that is not well presented in the synthesized fake videos. Our method is tested over benchmarks of eye-blinking detection datasets and also show promising performance on detecting videos generated with DeepFake. 
### 131.Revisiting the Importance of Individual Units in CNNs via Ablation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02891.pdf)
> We revisit the importance of the individual units in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for visual recognition. By conducting unit ablation experiments on CNNs trained on large scale image datasets, we demonstrate that, though ablating any individual unit does not hurt overall classification accuracy, it does lead to significant damage on the accuracy of specific classes. This result shows that an individual unit is specialized to encode information relevant to a subset of classes. We compute the correlation between the accuracy drop under unit ablation and various attributes of an individual unit such as class selectivity and weight L1 norm. We confirm that unit attributes such as class selectivity are a poor predictor for impact on overall accuracy as found previously in recent work \cite{morcos2018importance}. However, our results show that class selectivity along with other attributes are good predictors of the importance of one unit to individual classes. We evaluate the impact of random rotation, batch normalization, and dropout to the importance of units to specific classes. Our results show that units with high selectivity play an important role in network classification power at the individual class level. Understanding and interpreting the behavior of these units is necessary and meaningful. 
### 132.Copy Move Forgery using Hus Invariant Moments and Log Polar  Transformations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02907.pdf)
> With the increase in interchange of data, there is a growing necessity of security. Considering the volumes of digital data that is transmitted, they are in need to be secure. Among the many forms of tampering possible, one widespread technique is Copy Move Forgery CMF. This forgery occurs when parts of the image are copied and duplicated elsewhere in the same image. There exist a number of algorithms to detect such a forgery in which the primary step involved is feature extraction. The feature extraction techniques employed must have lesser time and space complexity involved for an efficient and faster processing of media. Also, majority of the existing state of art techniques often tend to falsely match similar genuine objects as copy move forged during the detection process. To tackle these problems, the paper proposes a novel algorithm that recognizes a unique approach of using Hus Invariant Moments and Log polar Transformations to reduce feature vector dimension to one feature per block simultaneously detecting CMF among genuine similar objects in an image. The qualitative and quantitative results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm. 
### 133.Non-Local Recurrent Network for Image Restoration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02919.pdf)
> Many classic methods have shown non-local self-similarity in natural images to be an effective prior for image restoration. However, it remains unclear and challenging to make use of this intrinsic property via deep networks. In this paper, we propose a non-local recurrent network (NLRN) as the first attempt to incorporate non-local operations into a recurrent neural network (RNN) for image restoration. The main contributions of this work are: (1) Unlike existing methods that measure self-similarity in an isolated manner, the proposed non-local module can be flexibly integrated into existing deep networks for end-to-end training to capture deep feature correlation between each location and its neighborhood. (2) We fully employ the RNN structure for its parameter efficiency and allow deep feature correlation to be propagated along adjacent recurrent states. This new design boosts robustness against inaccurate correlation estimation due to severely degraded images. (3) We show that it is essential to maintain a confined neighborhood for computing deep feature correlation given degraded images. This is in contrast to existing practice that deploys the whole image. Extensive experiments on both image denoising and super-resolution tasks are conducted. Thanks to the recurrent non-local operations and correlation propagation, the proposed NLRN achieves superior results to state-of-the-art methods with much fewer parameters. 
### 134.RGCNN: Regularized Graph CNN for Point Cloud Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02952.pdf)
> Point cloud, an efficient 3D object representation, has become popular with the development of depth sensing and 3D laser scanning techniques. It has attracted attention in various applications such as 3D tele-presence, navigation for unmanned vehicles and heritage reconstruction. The understanding of point clouds, such as point cloud segmentation, is crucial in exploiting the informative value of point clouds for such applications. Due to the irregularity of the data format, previous deep learning works often convert point clouds to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images before feeding them into neural networks, which leads to voluminous data and quantization artifacts. In this paper, we instead propose a regularized graph convolutional neural network (RGCNN) that directly consumes point clouds. Leveraging on spectral graph theory, we treat features of points in a point cloud as signals on graph, and define the convolution over graph by Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In particular, we update the graph Laplacian matrix that describes the connectivity of features in each layer according to the corresponding learned features, which adaptively captures the structure of dynamic graphs. Further, we deploy a graph-signal smoothness prior in the loss function, thus regularizing the learning process. Experimental results on the ShapeNet part dataset show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving competitive performance with the state of the art. Also, experiments show RGCNN is much more robust to both noise and point cloud density in comparison with other methods. We further apply RGCNN to point cloud classification and achieve competitive results on ModelNet40 dataset. 
### 135.BSN: Boundary Sensitive Network for Temporal Action Proposal Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02964.pdf)
> Temporal action proposal generation is an important yet challenging problem, since temporal proposals with rich action content are indispensable for analysing real-world videos with long duration and high proportion irrelevant content. This problem requires methods not only generating proposals with precise temporal boundaries, but also retrieving proposals to cover truth action instances with high recall and high overlap using relatively fewer proposals. To address these difficulties, we introduce an effective proposal generation method, named Boundary-Sensitive Network (BSN), which adopts "local to global" fashion. Locally, BSN first locates temporal boundaries with high probabilities, then directly combines these boundaries as proposals. Globally, with Boundary-Sensitive Proposal feature, BSN retrieves proposals by evaluating the confidence of whether a proposal contains an action within its region. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, where BSN outperforms other state-of-the-art temporal action proposal generation methods with high recall and high temporal precision. Finally, further experiments demonstrate that by combining existing action classifiers, our method significantly improves the state-of-the-art temporal action detection performance. 
### 136.Fingerprint liveness detection using local quality features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02974.pdf)
> Fingerprint-based recognition has been widely deployed in various applications. However, current recognition systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks which make use of an artificial replica of a fingerprint to deceive the sensors. In such scenarios, fingerprint liveness detection ensures the actual presence of a real legitimate fingerprint in contrast to a fake self-manufactured synthetic sample. In this paper, we propose a static software-based approach using quality features to detect the liveness in a fingerprint. We have extracted features from a single fingerprint image to overcome the issues faced in dynamic software-based approaches which require longer computational time and user cooperation. The proposed system extracts 8 sensor independent quality features on a local level containing minute details of the ridge-valley structure of real and fake fingerprints. These local quality features constitutes a 13-dimensional feature vector. The system is tested on a publically available dataset of LivDet 2009 competition. The experimental results exhibit supremacy of the proposed method over current state-of-the-art approaches providing least average classification error of 5.3% for LivDet 2009. Additionally, effectiveness of the best performing features over LivDet 2009 is evaluated on the latest LivDet 2015 dataset which contain fingerprints fabricated using unknown spoof materials. An average classification error rate of 4.22% is achieved in comparison with 4.49% obtained by the LivDet 2015 winner. Further, the proposed system utilizes a single fingerprint image, which results in faster implications and makes it more user-friendly. 
### 137.DeepFirearm: Learning Discriminative Feature Representation for  Fine-grained Firearm Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02984.pdf)
> There are great demands for automatically regulating inappropriate appearance of shocking firearm images in social media or identifying firearm types in forensics. Image retrieval techniques have great potential to solve these problems. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce Firearm 14k, a large dataset consisting of over 14,000 images in 167 categories. It can be used for both fine-grained recognition and retrieval of firearm images. Recent advances in image retrieval are mainly driven by fine-tuning state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for retrieval task. The conventional single margin contrastive loss, known for its simplicity and good performance, has been widely used. We find that it performs poorly on the Firearm 14k dataset due to: (1) Loss contributed by positive and negative image pairs is unbalanced during training process. (2) A huge domain gap exists between this dataset and ImageNet. We propose to deal with the unbalanced loss by employing a double margin contrastive loss. We tackle the domain gap issue with a two-stage training strategy, where we first fine-tune the network for classification, and then fine-tune it for retrieval. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the conventional single margin approach by a large margin (up to 88.5% relative improvement) and even surpasses the strong triplet-loss-based approach. 
### 138.A Systematic Evaluation of Recent Deep Learning Architectures for  Fine-Grained Vehicle Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02987.pdf)
> Fine-grained vehicle classification is the task of classifying make, model, and year of a vehicle. This is a very challenging task, because vehicles of different types but similar color and viewpoint can often look much more similar than vehicles of same type but differing color and viewpoint. Vehicle make, model, and year in com- bination with vehicle color - are of importance in several applications such as vehicle search, re-identification, tracking, and traffic analysis. In this work we investigate the suitability of several recent landmark convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, which have shown top results on large scale image classification tasks, for the task of fine-grained classification of vehicles. We compare the performance of the networks VGG16, several ResNets, Inception architectures, the recent DenseNets, and MobileNet. For classification we use the Stanford Cars-196 dataset which features 196 different types of vehicles. We investigate several aspects of CNN training, such as data augmentation and training from scratch vs. fine-tuning. Importantly, we introduce no aspects in the architectures or training process which are specific to vehicle classification. Our final model achieves a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 94.6% outperforming all related works, even approaches which are specifically tailored for the task, e.g. by including vehicle part detections. 
### 139.Logarithmic Mathematical Morphology: a new framework robust to  illumination changes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02998.pdf)
> A new set of mathematical morphology (MM) operators robust to illumination changes in images is defined thanks to the Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) model which is based on physical laws of acquisition and which is consistent with human vision. The fundamental operators of logarithmic-MM, the logarithmic-dilation and the logarithmic-erosion, are defined with the LIP-addition of a structuring function. The combination of these two adjunct operators gives morphological filters, namely the logarithmic-opening and closing, useful for pattern recognition. The mathematical relation existing between "classical" dilation and erosion-with an additive structuring function-and their logarithmic-versions is established facilitating their implementation. Results on simulated and real images show that logarithmic-MM is more efficient on low-contrasted information than "classical" MM. 
### 140.Domain Adaptive Generation of Aircraft on Satellite Imagery via  Simulated and Unsupervised Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03002.pdf)
> Object detection and classification for aircraft are the most important tasks in the satellite image analysis. The success of modern detection and classification methods has been based on machine learning and deep learning. One of the key requirements for those learning processes is huge data to train. However, there is an insufficient portion of aircraft since the targets are on military action and oper- ation. Considering the characteristics of satellite imagery, this paper attempts to provide a framework of the simulated and unsupervised methodology without any additional su- pervision or physical assumptions. Finally, the qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed a potential to replenish insufficient data for machine learning platform for satellite image analysis. 
### 141.Machine learning-based colon deformation estimation method for  colonoscope tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03014.pdf)
> This paper presents a colon deformation estimation method, which can be used to estimate colon deformations during colonoscope insertions. Colonoscope tracking or navigation system that navigates a physician to polyp positions during a colonoscope insertion is required to reduce complications such as colon perforation. A previous colonoscope tracking method obtains a colonoscope position in the colon by registering a colonoscope shape and a colon shape. The colonoscope shape is obtained using an electromagnetic sensor, and the colon shape is obtained from a CT volume. However, large tracking errors were observed due to colon deformations occurred during colonoscope insertions. Such deformations make the registration difficult. Because the colon deformation is caused by a colonoscope, there is a strong relationship between the colon deformation and the colonoscope shape. An estimation method of colon deformations occur during colonoscope insertions is necessary to reduce tracking errors. We propose a colon deformation estimation method. This method is used to estimate a deformed colon shape from a colonoscope shape. We use the regression forests algorithm to estimate a deformed colon shape. The regression forests algorithm is trained using pairs of colon and colonoscope shapes, which contains deformations occur during colonoscope insertions. As a preliminary study, we utilized the method to estimate deformations of a colon phantom. In our experiments, the proposed method correctly estimated deformed colon phantom shapes. 
### 142.Large-scale Bisample Learning on ID vs. Spot Face Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03018.pdf)
> In many face recognition applications, there is large amount of face data with two images for each person. One is an ID photo for face enrollment, and the other is a probe photo captured on spot. Most existing methods are designed for training data with limited breadth (relatively small class number) and sufficient depth (many samples for each class). They would meet great challenges when applied on this ID vs. Spot (IvS) data, including the under-represented intra-class variations and the excessive demand on computing devices. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based large-scale bisample learning (LBL) method for IvS face recognition. To tackle the bisample problem that there are only two samples for each class, a classification-verification-classification (CVC) training strategy is proposed to progressively enhance the IvS performance. Besides, a dominant prototype softmax (DP-softmax) is incorporated to make the deep learning applicable on large-scale classes. We conduct LBL on a IvS face dataset with more than two million identities. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves superior performance than previous ones, validating the effectiveness of LBL on IvS face recognition. 
### 143.3D FCN Feature Driven Regression Forest-Based Pancreas Localization and  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03019.pdf)
> This paper presents a fully automated atlas-based pancreas segmentation method from CT volumes utilizing 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) feature-based pancreas localization. Segmentation of the pancreas is difficult because it has larger inter-patient spatial variations than other organs. Previous pancreas segmentation methods failed to deal with such variations. We propose a fully automated pancreas segmentation method that contains novel localization and segmentation. Since the pancreas neighbors many other organs, its position and size are strongly related to the positions of the surrounding organs. We estimate the position and the size of the pancreas (localized) from global features by regression forests. As global features, we use intensity differences and 3D FCN deep learned features, which include automatically extracted essential features for segmentation. We chose 3D FCN features from a trained 3D U-Net, which is trained to perform multi-organ segmentation. The global features include both the pancreas and surrounding organ information. After localization, a patient-specific probabilistic atlas-based pancreas segmentation is performed. In evaluation results with 146 CT volumes, we achieved 60.6% of the Jaccard index and 73.9% of the Dice overlap. 
### 144.Generating Image Sequence from Description with LSTM Conditional GAN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03027.pdf)
> Generating images from word descriptions is a challenging task. Generative adversarial networks(GANs) are shown to be able to generate realistic images of real-life objects. In this paper, we propose a new neural network architecture of LSTM Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks to generate images of real-life objects. Our proposed model is trained on the Oxford-102 Flowers and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 datasets. We demonstrate that our proposed model produces the better results surpassing other state-of-art approaches. 
### 145.Unsupervised Feature Learning Toward a Real-time Vehicle Make and Model  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03028.pdf)
> Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (MMR) systems provide a fully automatic framework to recognize and classify different vehicle models. Several approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, however they can perform in restricted conditions. Here, we formulate the vehicle make and model recognition as a fine-grained classification problem and propose a new configurable on-road vehicle make and model recognition framework. We benefit from the unsupervised feature learning methods and in more details we employ Locality constraint Linear Coding (LLC) method as a fast feature encoder for encoding the input SIFT features. The proposed method can perform in real environments of different conditions. This framework can recognize fifty models of vehicles and has an advantage to classify every other vehicle not belonging to one of the specified fifty classes as an unknown vehicle. The proposed MMR framework can be configured to become faster or more accurate based on the application domain. The proposed approach is examined on two datasets including Iranian on-road vehicle dataset and CompuCar dataset. The Iranian on-road vehicle dataset contains images of 50 models of vehicles captured in real situations by traffic cameras in different weather and lighting conditions. Experimental results show superiority of the proposed framework over the state-of-the-art methods on Iranian on-road vehicle datatset and comparable results on CompuCar dataset with 97.5% and 98.4% accuracies, respectively. 
### 146.Deep multi-scale architectures for monocular depth estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03051.pdf)
> This paper aims at understanding the role of multi-scale information in the estimation of depth from monocular images. More precisely, the paper investigates four different deep CNN architectures, designed to explicitly make use of multi-scale features along the network, and compare them to a state-of-the-art single-scale approach. The paper also shows that involving multi-scale features in depth estimation not only improves the performance in terms of accuracy, but also gives qualitatively better depth maps. Experiments are done on the widely used NYU Depth dataset, on which the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. 
### 147.Unifying Identification and Context Learning for Person Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03084.pdf)
> Despite the great success of face recognition techniques, recognizing persons under unconstrained settings remains challenging. Issues like profile views, unfavorable lighting, and occlusions can cause substantial difficulties. Previous works have attempted to tackle this problem by exploiting the context, e.g. clothes and social relations. While showing promising improvement, they are usually limited in two important aspects, relying on simple heuristics to combine different cues and separating the construction of context from people identities. In this work, we aim to move beyond such limitations and propose a new framework to leverage context for person recognition. In particular, we propose a Region Attention Network, which is learned to adaptively combine visual cues with instance-dependent weights. We also develop a unified formulation, where the social contexts are learned along with the reasoning of people identities. These models substantially improve the robustness when working with the complex contextual relations in unconstrained environments. On two large datasets, PIPA and Cast In Movies (CIM), a new dataset proposed in this work, our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under multiple evaluation policies. 
### 148.Uncertainty-driven Sanity Check: Application to Postoperative Brain  Tumor Cavity Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03106.pdf)
> Uncertainty estimates of modern neuronal networks provide additional information next to the computed predictions and are thus expected to improve the understanding of the underlying model. Reliable uncertainties are particularly interesting for safety-critical computer-assisted applications in medicine, e.g., neurosurgical interventions and radiotherapy planning. We propose an uncertainty-driven sanity check for the identification of segmentation results that need particular expert review. Our method uses a fully-convolutional neural network and computes uncertainty estimates by the principle of Monte Carlo dropout. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a clinical dataset with 30 postoperative brain tumor images. The method can segment the highly inhomogeneous resection cavities accurately (Dice coefficients 0.792 $\pm$ 0.154). Furthermore, the proposed sanity check is able to detect the worst segmentation and three out of the four outliers. The results highlight the potential of using the additional information from the model's parameter uncertainty to validate the segmentation performance of a deep learning model. 
### 149.VTrails: Inferring Vessels with Geodesic Connectivity Trees [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03111.pdf)
> The analysis of vessel morphology and connectivity has an impact on a number of cardiovascular and neurovascular applications by providing patient-specific high-level quantitative features such as spatial location, direction and scale. In this paper we present an end-to-end approach to extract an acyclic vascular tree from angiographic data by solving a connectivity-enforcing anisotropic fast marching over a voxel-wise tensor field representing the orientation of the underlying vascular tree. The method is validated using synthetic and real vascular images. We compare VTrails against classical and state-of-the-art ridge detectors for tubular structures by assessing the connectedness of the vesselness map and inspecting the synthesized tensor field as proof of concept. VTrails performance is evaluated on images with different levels of degradation: we verify that the extracted vascular network is an acyclic graph (i.e. a tree), and we report the extraction accuracy, precision and recall. 
### 150.Automatic View Planning with Multi-scale Deep Reinforcement Learning  Agents [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03228.pdf)
> We propose a fully automatic method to find standardized view planes in 3D image acquisitions. Standard view images are important in clinical practice as they provide a means to perform biometric measurements from similar anatomical regions. These views are often constrained to the native orientation of a 3D image acquisition. Navigating through target anatomy to find the required view plane is tedious and operator-dependent. For this task, we employ a multi-scale reinforcement learning (RL) agent framework and extensively evaluate several Deep Q-Network (DQN) based strategies. RL enables a natural learning paradigm by interaction with the environment, which can be used to mimic experienced operators. We evaluate our results using the distance between the anatomical landmarks and detected planes, and the angles between their normal vector and target. The proposed algorithm is assessed on the mid-sagittal and anterior-posterior commissure planes of brain MRI, and the 4-chamber long-axis plane commonly used in cardiac MRI, achieving accuracy of 1.53mm, 1.98mm and 4.84mm, respectively. 
### 151.PatchFCN for Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03265.pdf)
> This paper studies the problem of detecting acute intracranial hemorrhage on head computed tomography (CT) scans. We formulate it as a pixel-wise labeling task of the frames that constitute a single head scan. The standard approach for this task is the fully convolutional network (FCN) which runs on the whole image at both training and test time. We propose a patch-based approach that controls the amount of context available to the FCN, based on the observation that when radiologists are interpreting CT scans, their judgment depends primarily on local cues and does not require the whole image context. To develop and validate the system, we collected a pixel-wise labeled dataset of 591 scans that covers a wide range of hemorrhage types and imaging conditions in the real world. We show that no pretraining from natural images is needed. By aggregating the pixel-wise labeling, our system is able to make region-level, frame-level, and stack-level decisions. Our final system approaches an expert radiologist performance with a high average precision (AP) of 96.5 +/- 1.3 % for hemorrhage classification on stack level while running at 23ms per frame 
### 152.DMCNN: Dual-Domain Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network for  Compression Artifacts Removal [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03275.pdf)
> JPEG is one of the most commonly used standards among lossy image compression methods. However, JPEG compression inevitably introduces various kinds of artifacts, especially at high compression rates, which could greatly affect the Quality of Experience (QoE). Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have shown excellent performance for removing the JPEG artifacts. Lots of efforts have been made to deepen the CNNs and extract deeper features, while relatively few works pay attention to the receptive field of the network. In this paper, we illustrate that the quality of output images can be significantly improved by enlarging the receptive fields in many cases. One step further, we propose a Dual-domain Multi-scale CNN (DMCNN) to take full advantage of redundancies on both the pixel and DCT domains. Experiments show that DMCNN sets a new state-of-the-art for the task of JPEG artifact removal. 
### 153.Unsupervised Learning for Surgical Motion by Learning to Predict the  Future [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03318.pdf)
> We show that it is possible to learn meaningful representations of surgical motion, without supervision, by learning to predict the future. An architecture that combines an RNN encoder-decoder and mixture density networks (MDNs) is developed to model the conditional distribution over future motion given past motion. We show that the learned encodings naturally cluster according to high-level activities, and we demonstrate the usefulness of these learned encodings in the context of information retrieval, where a database of surgical motion is searched for suturing activity using a motion-based query. Future prediction with MDNs is found to significantly outperform simpler baselines as well as the best previously-published result for this task, advancing state-of-the-art performance from an F1 score of 0.60 +- 0.14 to 0.77 +- 0.05. 
### 154.DSSLIC: Deep Semantic Segmentation-based Layered Image Compression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03348.pdf)
> Deep learning has revolutionized many computer vision fields in the last few years, including learning-based image compression. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic segmentation-based layered image compression (DSSLIC) framework in which the semantic segmentation map of the input image is obtained and encoded as the base layer of the bit-stream. A compact representation of the input image is also generated and encoded as the first enhancement layer. The segmentation map and the compact version of the image are then employed to obtain a coarse reconstruction of the image. The residual between the input and the coarse reconstruction is additionally encoded as another enhancement layer. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the H.265/HEVC-based BPG and other codecs in both PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics across a wide range of bit rates in RGB domain. Besides, since semantic segmentation map is included in the bit-stream, the proposed scheme can facilitate many other tasks such as image search and object-based adaptive image compression. 
### 155.A Content-Based Late Fusion Approach Applied to Pedestrian Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03361.pdf)
> The variety of pedestrians detectors proposed in recent years has encouraged some works to fuse pedestrian detectors to achieve a more accurate detection. The intuition behind is to combine the detectors based on its spatial consensus. We propose a novel method called Content-Based Spatial Consensus (CSBC), which, in addition to relying on spatial consensus, considers the content of the detection windows to learn a weighted-fusion of pedestrian detectors. The result is a reduction in false alarms and an enhancement in the detection. In this work, we also demonstrate that there is small influence of the feature used to learn the contents of the windows of each detector, which enables our method to be efficient even employing simple features. The CSBC overcomes state-of-the-art fusion methods in the ETH dataset and in the Caltech dataset. Particularly, our method is more efficient since fewer detectors are necessary to achieve expressive results. 
### 156.Self-supervisory Signals for Object Discovery and Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03370.pdf)
> In robotic applications, we often face the challenge of discovering new objects while having very little or no labelled training data. In this paper we explore the use of self-supervision provided by a robot traversing an environment to learn representations of encountered objects. Knowledge of ego-motion and depth perception enables the agent to effectively associate multiple object proposals, which serve as training data for learning object representations from unlabelled images. We demonstrate the utility of this representation in two ways. First, we can automatically discover objects by performing clustering in the learned embedding space. Each resulting cluster contains examples of one instance seen from various viewpoints and scales. Second, given a small number of labeled images, we can efficiently learn detectors for these labels. In the few-shot regime, these detectors have a substantially higher mAP of 0.22 compared to 0.12 of off-the-shelf standard detectors trained on this limited data. Thus, the proposed self-supervision results in effective environment specific object discovery and detection at no or very small human labeling cost. 
### 157.CS-VQA: Visual Question Answering with Compressively Sensed Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03379.pdf)
> Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a complex semantic task requiring both natural language processing and visual recognition. In this paper, we explore whether VQA is solvable when images are captured in a sub-Nyquist compressive paradigm. We develop a series of deep-network architectures that exploit available compressive data to increasing degrees of accuracy, and show that VQA is indeed solvable in the compressed domain. Our results show that there is nominal degradation in VQA performance when using compressive measurements, but that accuracy can be recovered when VQA pipelines are used in conjunction with state-of-the-art deep neural networks for CS reconstruction. The results presented yield important implications for resource-constrained VQA applications. 
### 158.Fully Convolutional Networks with Sequential Information for Robust Crop  and Weed Detection in Precision Farming [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03412.pdf)
> Reducing the use of agrochemicals is an important component towards sustainable agriculture. Robots that can perform targeted weed control offer the potential to contribute to this goal, for example, through specialized weeding actions such as selective spraying or mechanical weed removal. A prerequisite of such systems is a reliable and robust plant classification system that is able to distinguish crop and weed in the field. A major challenge in this context is the fact that different fields show a large variability. Thus, classification systems have to robustly cope with substantial environmental changes with respect to weed pressure and weed types, growth stages of the crop, visual appearance, and soil conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel crop-weed classification system that relies on a fully convolutional network with an encoder-decoder structure and incorporates spatial information by considering image sequences. Exploiting the crop arrangement information that is observable from the image sequences enables our system to robustly estimate a pixel-wise labeling of the images into crop and weed, i.e., a semantic segmentation. We provide a thorough experimental evaluation, which shows that our system generalizes well to previously unseen fields under varying environmental conditions --- a key capability to actually use such systems in precision framing. We provide comparisons to other state-of-the-art approaches and show that our system substantially improves the accuracy of crop-weed classification without requiring a retraining of the model. 
### 159.Joint Stem Detection and Crop-Weed Classification for Plant-specific  Treatment in Precision Farming [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03413.pdf)
> Applying agrochemicals is the default procedure for conventional weed control in crop production, but has negative impacts on the environment. Robots have the potential to treat every plant in the field individually and thus can reduce the required use of such chemicals. To achieve that, robots need the ability to identify crops and weeds in the field and must additionally select effective treatments. While certain types of weed can be treated mechanically, other types need to be treated by (selective) spraying. In this paper, we present an approach that provides the necessary information for effective plant-specific treatment. It outputs the stem location for weeds, which allows for mechanical treatments, and the covered area of the weed for selective spraying. Our approach uses an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates stem positions as well as the covered area of crops and weeds. It jointly learns the class-wise stem detection and the pixel-wise semantic segmentation. Experimental evaluations on different real-world datasets show that our approach is able to reliably solve this problem. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach not only substantially improves the stem detection accuracy, i.e., distinguishing crop and weed stems, but also provides an improvement in the semantic segmentation performance. 
### 160.Abstaining Classification When Error Costs are Unequal and Unknown [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03445.pdf)
> Abstaining classificaiton aims to reject to classify the easily misclassified examples, so it is an effective approach to increase the clasificaiton reliability and reduce the misclassification risk in the cost-sensitive applications. In such applications, different types of errors (false positive or false negative) usaully have unequal costs. And the error costs, which depend on specific applications, are usually unknown. However, current abstaining classification methods either do not distinguish the error types, or they need the cost information of misclassification and rejection, which are realized in the framework of cost-sensitive learning. In this paper, we propose a bounded-abstention method with two constraints of reject rates (BA2), which performs abstaining classification when error costs are unequal and unknown. BA2 aims to obtain the optimal area under the ROC curve (AUC) by constraining the reject rates of the positive and negative classes respectively. Specifically, we construct the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and stepwise search the optimal reject thresholds from both ends of the curve, untill the two constraints are satisfied. Experimental results show that BA2 obtains higher AUC and lower total cost than the state-of-the-art abstaining classification methods. Meanwhile, BA2 achieves controllable reject rates of the positive and negative classes. 
### 161.Robust Semantic Segmentation with Ladder-DenseNet Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03465.pdf)
> We present semantic segmentation experiments with a model capable to perform predictions on four benchmark datasets: Cityscapes, ScanNet, WildDash and KITTI. We employ a ladder-style convolutional architecture featuring a modified DenseNet-169 model in the downsampling datapath, and only one convolution in each stage of the upsampling datapath. Due to limited computing resources, we perform the training only on Cityscapes Fine train+val, ScanNet train, WildDash val and KITTI train. We evaluate the trained model on the test subsets of the four benchmarks in concordance with the guidelines of the Robust Vision Challenge ROB 2018. The performed experiments reveal several interesting findings which we describe and discuss. 
### 162.Learning to Grasp from a Single Demonstration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03486.pdf)
> Learning-based approaches for robotic grasping using visual sensors typically require collecting a large size dataset, either manually labeled or by many trial and errors of a robotic manipulator in the real or simulated world. We propose a simpler learning-from-demonstration approach that is able to detect the object to grasp from merely a single demonstration using a convolutional neural network we call GraspNet. In order to increase robustness and decrease the training time even further, we leverage data from previous demonstrations to quickly fine-tune a GrapNet for each new demonstration. We present some preliminary results on a grasping experiment with the Franka Panda cobot for which we can train a GraspNet with only hundreds of train iterations. 
### 163.Feature Pyramid Network for Multi-Class Land Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03510.pdf)
> Semantic segmentation is in-demand in satellite imagery processing. Because of the complex environment, automatic categorization and segmentation of land cover is a challenging problem. Solving it can help to overcome many obstacles in urban planning, environmental engineering or natural landscape monitoring. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic multi-class land segmentation based on a fully convolutional neural network of feature pyramid network (FPN) family. This network is consisted of pre-trained on ImageNet Resnet50 encoder and neatly developed decoder. Based on validation results, leaderboard score and our own experience this network shows reliable results for the DEEPGLOBE - CVPR 2018 land cover classification sub-challenge. Moreover, this network moderately uses memory that allows using GTX 1080 or 1080 TI video cards to perform whole training and makes pretty fast predictions. 
### 164.Cell Detection with Star-convex Polygons [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03535.pdf)
> Automatic detection and segmentation of cells and nuclei in microscopy images is important for many biological applications. Recent successful learning-based approaches include per-pixel cell segmentation with subsequent pixel grouping, or localization of bounding boxes with subsequent shape refinement. In situations of crowded cells, these can be prone to segmentation errors, such as falsely merging bordering cells or suppressing valid cell instances due to the poor approximation with bounding boxes. To overcome these issues, we propose to localize cell nuclei via star-convex polygons, which are a much better shape representation as compared to bounding boxes and thus do not need shape refinement. To that end, we train a convolutional neural network that predicts for every pixel a polygon for the cell instance at that position. We demonstrate the merits of our approach on two synthetic datasets and one challenging dataset of diverse fluorescence microscopy images. 
### 165.Sparse Over-complete Patch Matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03556.pdf)
> Image patch matching, which is the process of identifying corresponding patches across images, has been used as a subroutine for many computer vision and image processing tasks. State -of-the-art patch matching techniques take image patches as input to a convolutional neural network to extract the patch features and evaluate their similarity. Our aim in this paper is to improve on the state of the art patch matching techniques by observing the fact that a sparse-overcomplete representation of an image posses statistical properties of natural visual scenes which can be exploited for patch matching. We propose a new paradigm which encodes image patch details by encoding the patch and subsequently using this sparse representation as input to a neural network to compare the patches. As sparse coding is based on a generative model of natural image patches, it can represent the patch in terms of the fundamental visual components from which it has been composed of, leading to similar sparse codes for patches which are built from similar components. Once the sparse coded features are extracted, we employ a fully-connected neural network, which captures the non-linear relationships between features, for comparison. We have evaluated our approach using the Liberty and Notredame subsets of the popular UBC patch dataset and set a new benchmark outperforming all state-of-the-art patch matching techniques for these datasets. 
### 166.Semantic Correspondence: A Hierarchical Approach [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03560.pdf)
> Establishing semantic correspondence across images when the objects in the images have undergone complex deformations remains a challenging task in the field of computer vision. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical method to tackle this problem by first semantically targeting the foreground objects to localize the search space and then looking deeply into multiple levels of the feature representation to search for point-level correspondence. In contrast to existing approaches, which typically penalize large discrepancies, our approach allows for significant displacements, with the aim to accommodate large deformations of the objects in scene. Localizing the search space by semantically matching object-level correspondence, our method robustly handles large deformations of objects. Representing the target region by concatenated hypercolumn features which take into account the hierarchical levels of the surrounding context, helps to clear the ambiguity to further improve the accuracy. By conducting multiple experiments across scenes with non-rigid objects, we validate the proposed approach, and show that it outperforms the state of the art methods for semantic correspondence establishment. 
### 167.FMHash: Deep Hashing of In-Air-Handwriting for User Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03574.pdf)
> Gesture biometrics are gaining popularity with gesture input interface on mobile and Virtual Reality (VR) platforms that lack a keyboard or touchscreen to type a password for user authentication. However, less attention is paid to the gesture-based user identification problem, which essentially requires indexing and searching the gesture motion templates in a large database efficiently. In this paper, we propose FMHash, a user identification framework that can generate a compact binary hash code from a piece of in-air-handwriting of an ID string, which allows fast search in a database of in-air-handwriting templates through a hash table. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, we implemented a prototype and report preliminary results (~98% precision and ~93% recall). More detailed evaluation, comparison, and improvement is working-in-progress. The ability of hashing in-air-handwriting pattern to binary code can be used to achieve convenient sign-in and sign-up with in-air-handwriting gesture ID on future mobile and VR devices. 
### 168.Accurate Spectral Super-resolution from Single RGB Image Using  Multi-scale CNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03575.pdf)
> Different from traditional hyperspectral super-resolution approaches that focus on improving the spatial resolution, spectral super-resolution aims at producing a high-resolution hyperspectral image from the RGB observation with super-resolution in spectral domain. However, it is challenging to accurately reconstruct a high-dimensional continuous spectrum from three discrete intensity values at each pixel, since too much information is lost during the procedure where the latent hyperspectral image is downsampled (e.g., with x10 scaling factor) in spectral domain to produce an RGB observation. To address this problem, we present a multi-scale deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to explicitly map the input RGB image into a hyperspectral image. Through symmetrically downsampling and upsampling the intermediate feature maps in a cascading paradigm, the local and non-local image information can be jointly encoded for spectral representation, ultimately improving the spectral reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on a large hyperspectral dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
### 169.Instance Search via Instance Level Segmentation and Feature  Representation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03576.pdf)
> Instance search is an interesting task as well as a challenging issue due to the lack of effective feature representation. In this paper, an instance level feature representation built upon recent fully convolutional instance-aware segmentation is proposed. The feature is ROI-pooled based on the segmented instance region. So that instances in different sizes and layouts are represented by deep feature in uniform length. This representation is further enhanced by the use of deformable ResNeXt blocks. Superior performance in terms of its distinctiveness and scalability is observed on a challenging evaluation dataset built by ourselves. 
### 170.EREL Selection using Morphological Relation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03580.pdf)
> This work concentrates on Extremal Regions of Extremum Level (EREL) selection. EREL is a recently proposed feature detector aiming at detecting regions from a set of extremal regions. This is a branching problem derived from segmentation of arterial wall boundaries from Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) images. For each IVUS frame, a set of EREL regions is generated to describe the luminal area of human coronary. Each EREL is then fitted by an ellipse to represent the luminal border. The goal is to assign the most appropriate EREL as the lumen. In this work, EREL selection carries out in two rounds. In the first round, the pattern in a set of EREL regions is analyzed and used to generate an approximate luminal region. Then, the two-dimensional (2D) correlation coefficients are computed between this approximate region and each EREL to keep the ones with tightest relevance. In the second round, a compactness measure is calculated for each EREL and its fitted ellipse to guarantee that the resulting EREL has not affected by the common artifacts such as bifurcations, shadows, and side branches. We evaluated the selected ERELs in terms of Hausdorff Distance (HD) and Jaccard Measure (JM) on the train and test set of a publicly available dataset. The results show that our selection strategy outperforms the current state-of-the-art. 
### 171.A Simplified Active Calibration algorithm for Focal Length Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03584.pdf)
> We introduce new linear mathematical formulations to calculate the focal length of a camera in an active platform. Through mathematical derivations, we show that the focal lengths in each direction can be estimated using only one point correspondence that relates images taken before and after a degenerate rotation of the camera. The new formulations will be beneficial in robotic and dynamic surveillance environments when the camera needs to be calibrated while it freely moves and zooms. By establishing a correspondence between only two images taken after slightly panning and tilting the camera and a reference image, our proposed Simplified Calibration Method is able to calculate the focal length of the camera. We extensively evaluate the derived formulations on a simulated camera, 3D scenes and real-world images. Our error analysis over simulated and real images indicates that the proposed Simplified Active Calibration formulation estimates the parameters of a camera with low error rates. 
### 172.Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03589.pdf)
> We present a novel deep learning based image inpainting system to complete images with free-form masks and inputs. The system is based on gated convolutions learned from millions of images without additional labelling efforts. The proposed gated convolution solves the issue of vanilla convolution that treats all input pixels as valid ones, generalizes partial convolution by providing a learnable dynamic feature selection mechanism for each channel at each spatial location across all layers. Moreover, as free-form masks may appear anywhere in images with any shapes, global and local GANs designed for a single rectangular mask are not suitable. To this end, we also present a novel GAN loss, named SN-PatchGAN, by applying spectral-normalized discriminators on dense image patches. It is simple in formulation, fast and stable in training. Results on automatic image inpainting and user-guided extension demonstrate that our system generates higher-quality and more flexible results than previous methods. We show that our system helps users quickly remove distracting objects, modify image layouts, clear watermarks, edit faces and interactively create novel objects in images. Furthermore, visualization of learned feature representations reveals the effectiveness of gated convolution and provides an interpretation of how the proposed neural network fills in missing regions.

### 173.VoxelAtlasGAN: 3D Left Ventricle Segmentation on Echocardiography with  Atlas Guided Generation and Voxel-to-voxel Discrimination [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03619.pdf)
> 3D left ventricle (LV) segmentation on echocardiography is very important for diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease. It is not only because of that echocardiography is a real-time imaging technology and widespread in clinical application, but also because of that LV segmentation on 3D echocardiography can provide more full volume information of heart than LV segmentation on 2D echocardiography. However, 3D LV segmentation on echocardiography is still an open and challenging task owing to the lower contrast, higher noise and data dimensionality, limited annotation of 3D echocardiography. In this paper, we proposed a novel real-time framework, i.e., VoxelAtlasGAN, for 3D LV segmentation on 3D echocardiography. This framework has three contributions: 1) It is based on voxel-to-voxel conditional generative adversarial nets (cGAN). For the first time, cGAN is used for 3D LV segmentation on echocardiography. And cGAN advantageously fuses substantial 3D spatial context information from 3D echocardiography by self-learning structured loss; 2) For the first time, it embeds the atlas into an end-to-end optimization framework, which uses 3D LV atlas as a powerful prior knowledge to improve the inference speed, address the lower contrast and the limited annotation problems of 3D echocardiography; 3) It combines traditional discrimination loss and the new proposed consistent constraint, which further improves the generalization of the proposed framework. VoxelAtlasGAN was validated on 60 subjects on 3D echocardiography and it achieved satisfactory segmentation results and high inference speed. The mean surface distance is 1.85 mm, the mean hausdorff surface distance is 7.26 mm, mean dice is 0.953, the correlation of EF is 0.918, and the mean inference speed is 0.1s. These results have demonstrated that our proposed method has great potential for clinical application 
### 174.Transformationally Identical and Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks  through Symmetric Element Operators [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03636.pdf)
> Mathematically speaking, a transformationally invariant operator, such as a transformationally identical (TI) matrix kernel (i.e., K= T{K}), commutes with the transformation (T{.}) itself when they operate on the first operand matrix. We found that by consistently applying the same type of TI kernels in a convolutional neural networks (CNN) system, the commutative property holds throughout all layers of convolution processes with and without involving an activation function and/or a 1D convolution across channels within a layer. We further found that any CNN possessing the same TI kernel property for all convolution layers followed by a flatten layer with weight sharing among their transformation corresponding elements would output the same result for all transformation versions of the original input vector. In short, CNN[ Vi ] = CNN[ T{Vi} ] providing every K = T{K} in CNN, where Vi denotes input vector and CNN[.] represents the whole CNN process as a function of input vector that produces an output vector. With such a transformationally identical CNN (TI-CNN) system, each transformation, that is not associated with a predefined TI used in data augmentation, would inherently include all of its corresponding transformation versions of the input vector for the training. Hence the use of same TI property for every kernel in the CNN would serve as an orientation or a translation independent training guide in conjunction with the error-backpropagation during the training. This TI kernel property is desirable for applications requiring a highly consistent output result from corresponding transformation versions of an input. Several C programming routines are provided to facilitate interested parties of using the TI-CNN technique which is expected to produce a better generalization performance than its ordinary CNN counterpart. 
### 175.Segmentation of Arterial Walls in Intravascular Ultrasound  Cross-Sectional Images Using Extremal Region Selection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03695.pdf)
> Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) is an intra-operative imaging modality that facilitates observing and appraising the vessel wall structure of the human coronary arteries. Segmentation of arterial wall boundaries from the IVUS images is not only crucial for quantitative analysis of the vessel walls and plaque characteristics, but is also necessary for generating 3D reconstructed models of the artery. The aim of this study is twofold. Firstly, we investigate the feasibility of using a recently proposed region detector, namely Extremal Region of Extremum Level (EREL) to delineate the luminal and media-adventitia borders in IVUS frames acquired by 20 MHz probes. Secondly, we propose a region selection strategy to label two ERELs as lumen and media based on the stability of their textural information. We extensively evaluated our selection strategy on the test set of a standard publicly available dataset containing 326 IVUS B-mode images. We showed that in the best case, the average Hausdorff Distances (HD) between the extracted ERELs and the actual lumen and media were $0.22$ mm and $0.45$ mm, respectively. The results of our experiments revealed that our selection strategy was able to segment the lumen with $\le 0.3$ mm HD to the gold standard even though the images contained major artifacts such as bifurcations, shadows, and side branches. Moreover, when there was no artifact, our proposed method was able to delineate media-adventitia boundaries with $0.31$ mm HD to the gold standard. Furthermore, our proposed segmentation method runs in time that is linear in the number of pixels in each frame. Based on the results of this work, by using a 20 MHz IVUS probe with controlled pullback, not only can we now analyze the internal structure of human arteries more accurately, but also segment each frame during the pullback procedure because of the low run time of our proposed segmentation method. 
### 176.Unsupervised Video-to-Video Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03698.pdf)
> Unsupervised image-to-image translation is a recently proposed task of translating an image to a different style or domain given only unpaired image examples at training time. In this paper, we formulate a new task of unsupervised video-to-video translation, which poses its own unique challenges. Translating video implies learning not only the appearance of objects and scenes but also realistic motion and transitions between consecutive frames.We investigate the performance of per-frame video-to-video translation using existing image-to-image translation networks, and propose a spatio-temporal 3D translator as an alternative solution to this problem. We evaluate our 3D method on multiple synthetic datasets, such as moving colorized digits, as well as the realistic segmentation-to-video GTA dataset and a new CT-to-MRI volumetric images translation dataset. Our results show that frame-wise translation produces realistic results on a single frame level but underperforms significantly on the scale of the whole video compared to our three-dimensional translation approach, which is better able to learn the complex structure of video and motion and continuity of object appearance. 
### 177.Learning Answer Embeddings for Visual Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03724.pdf)
> We propose a novel probabilistic model for visual question answering (Visual QA). The key idea is to infer two sets of embeddings: one for the image and the question jointly and the other for the answers. The learning objective is to learn the best parameterization of those embeddings such that the correct answer has higher likelihood among all possible answers. In contrast to several existing approaches of treating Visual QA as multi-way classification, the proposed approach takes the semantic relationships (as characterized by the embeddings) among answers into consideration, instead of viewing them as independent ordinal numbers. Thus, the learned embedded function can be used to embed unseen answers (in the training dataset). These properties make the approach particularly appealing for transfer learning for open-ended Visual QA, where the source dataset on which the model is learned has limited overlapping with the target dataset in the space of answers. We have also developed large-scale optimization techniques for applying the model to datasets with a large number of answers, where the challenge is to properly normalize the proposed probabilistic models. We validate our approach on several Visual QA datasets and investigate its utility for transferring models across datasets. The empirical results have shown that the approach performs well not only on in-domain learning but also on transfer learning. 
### 178.Cross-Dataset Adaptation for Visual Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03726.pdf)
> We investigate the problem of cross-dataset adaptation for visual question answering (Visual QA). Our goal is to train a Visual QA model on a source dataset but apply it to another target one. Analogous to domain adaptation for visual recognition, this setting is appealing when the target dataset does not have a sufficient amount of labeled data to learn an "in-domain" model. The key challenge is that the two datasets are constructed differently, resulting in the cross-dataset mismatch on images, questions, or answers. <br />We overcome this difficulty by proposing a novel domain adaptation algorithm. Our method reduces the difference in statistical distributions by transforming the feature representation of the data in the target dataset. Moreover, it maximizes the likelihood of answering questions (in the target dataset) correctly using the Visual QA model trained on the source dataset. We empirically studied the effectiveness of the proposed approach on adapting among several popular Visual QA datasets. We show that the proposed method improves over baselines where there is no adaptation and several other adaptation methods. We both quantitatively and qualitatively analyze when the adaptation can be mostly effective. 
### 179.Robust Object Tracking with Crow Search Optimized Multi-cue Particle  Filter [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03753.pdf)
> Particle Filter(PF) is used extensively for estimation of target Non-linear and Non-gaussian state. However, its performance suffers due to inherent problem of sample degeneracy and impoverishment. In order to address this, we propose a novel resampling method based upon Crow Search Optimization to overcome low performing particles detected as outlier. Proposed outlier detection mechanism with transductive reliability achieve faster convergence of proposed PF tracking framework. In addition, we present an adaptive fuzzy fusion model to integrate multi-cue extracted for each evaluated particle. Automatic boosting and suppression of particles using proposed fusion model not only enhances performance of resampling method but also achieve optimal state estimation. Performance of the proposed tracker is evaluated over 12 benchmark video sequences and compared with state-of-the-art solutions. Qualitative and quantitative results reveals that the proposed tracker not only outperforms existing solutions but also efficiently handle various tracking challenges. On average of outcome, we achieve CLE of 7.98 and F-measure of 0.734. 
### 180.DOOBNet: Deep Object Occlusion Boundary Detection from an Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03772.pdf)
> Object occlusion boundary detection is a fundamental and crucial research problem in computer vision. This is challenging to solve as encountering the extreme boundary/non-boundary class imbalance during training an object occlusion boundary detector. In this paper, we propose to address this class imbalance by up-weighting the loss contribution of false negative and false positive examples with our novel Attention Loss function. We also propose a unified end-to-end multi-task deep object occlusion boundary detection network (DOOBNet) by sharing convolutional features to simultaneously predict object boundary and occlusion orientation. DOOBNet adopts an encoder-decoder structure with skip connection in order to automatically learn multi-scale and multi-level features. We significantly surpass the state-of-the-art on the PIOD dataset (ODS F-score of .702) and the BSDS ownership dataset (ODS F-score of .555), as well as improving the detecting speed to as 0.037s per image on the PIOD dataset. 
### 181.Generative Adversarial Network Architectures For Image Synthesis Using  Capsule Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03796.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures using Capsule Networks for conditional and random image-synthesis. Capsule Networks encode meta-properties and spatial relationships between the features of the image, which helps it become a more powerful critic in comparison to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used in current architectures for image synthesis. Our architectures use losses analogous to Wasserstein loss and Capsule Networks, which prove to be a more effective critic in comparison to CNNs. Thus, our proposed GAN architectures learn the data manifold much faster and therefore, show significant reduction in the number of training samples required to train when compared to the current work horses for image synthesis, DCGANs and its variants which utilize CNNs as discriminators. Also, our architecture generalizes over the datasets' manifold much better because of dynamic routing between capsules which is a more robust algorithm for feature globalization in comparison to max-pooling used by CNNs. This helps synthesize more diverse, yet visually accurate images. We have demonstrated the performance of our architectures over MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and their variants and compared them with the images synthesised using Improved Wasserstein GANs that use CNNs.

> In this work, we present a novel convolutional neural net- work based method for perfusion map generation in dynamic suscepti- bility contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging. The proposed architecture is trained end-to-end and solely relies on raw perfusion data for inference. We used a dataset of 151 acute ischemic stroke cases for evaluation. Our method generates perfusion maps that are comparable to the target maps used for clinical routine, while being model-free, fast, and less noisy. 
### 183.Data augmentation instead of explicit regularization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03852.pdf)
> Modern deep artificial neural networks have achieved impressive results through models with very large capacity---compared to the number of training examples---that control overfitting with the help of different forms of regularization. Regularization can be implicit, as is the case of stochastic gradient descent and parameter sharing in convolutional layers, or explicit. Most common explicit regularization techniques, such as weight decay and dropout, reduce the effective capacity of the model and typically require the use of deeper and wider architectures to compensate for the reduced capacity. Although these techniques have been proven successful in terms of improved generalization, they seem to waste capacity. In contrast, data augmentation techniques do not reduce the effective capacity and improve generalization by increasing the number of training examples. In this paper we systematically analyze the effect of data augmentation on some popular architectures and conclude that data augmentation alone---without any other explicit regularization techniques---can achieve the same performance or higher as regularized models, especially when training with fewer examples, and exhibits much higher adaptability to changes in the architecture. 
### 184.Object detection and tracking benchmark in industry based on improved  correlation filter [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03853.pdf)
> Real-time object detection and tracking have shown to be the basis of intelligent production for industrial 4.0 applications. It is a challenging task because of various distorted data in complex industrial setting. The correlation filter (CF) has been used to trade off the low-cost computation and high performance. However, traditional CF training strategy can not get satisfied performance for the various industrial data; because the simple sampling(bagging) during training process will not find the exact solutions in a data space with a large diversity. In this paper, we propose Dijkstra-distance based correlation filters (DBCF), which establishes a new learning framework that embeds distribution-related constraints into the multi-channel correlation filters (MCCF). DBCF is able to handle the huge variations existing in the industrial data by improving those constraints based on the shortest path among all solutions. To evaluate DBCF, we build a new dataset as the benchmark for industrial 4.0 application. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBCF produces high performance and exceeds the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset and source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/bczhangbczhang">this https URL</a> 
### 185.Massively Parallel Video Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03863.pdf)
> We introduce a class of causal video understanding models that aims to improve efficiency of video processing by maximising throughput, minimising latency, and reducing the number of clock cycles. Leveraging operation pipelining and multi-rate clocks, these models perform a minimal amount of computation (e.g. as few as four convolutional layers) for each frame per timestep to produce an output. The models are still very deep, with dozens of such operations being performed but in a pipelined fashion that enables depth-parallel computation. We illustrate the proposed principles by applying them to existing image architectures and analyse their behaviour on two video tasks: action recognition and human keypoint localisation. The results show that a significant degree of parallelism, and implicitly speedup, can be achieved with little loss in performance. 
### 186.Multi-Task Deep Networks for Depth-Based 6D Object Pose and Joint  Registration in Crowd Scenarios [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03891.pdf)
> In bin-picking scenarios, multiple instances of an object of interest are stacked in a pile randomly, and hence, the instances are inherently subjected to the challenges: severe occlusion, clutter, and similar-looking distractors. Most existing methods are, however, for single isolated object instances, while some recent methods tackle crowd scenarios as post-refinement which accounts multiple object relations. In this paper, we address recovering 6D poses of multiple instances in bin-picking scenarios in depth modality by multi-task learning in deep neural networks. Our architecture jointly learns multiple sub-tasks: 2D detection, depth, and 3D pose estimation of individual objects; and joint registration of multiple objects. For training data generation, depth images of physically plausible object pose configurations are generated by a 3D object model in a physics simulation, which yields diverse occlusion patterns to learn. We adopt a state-of-the-art object detector, and 2D offsets are further estimated via a network to refine misaligned 2D detections. The depth and 3D pose estimator is designed to generate multiple hypotheses per detection. This allows the joint registration network to learn occlusion patterns and remove physically implausible pose hypotheses. We apply our architecture on both synthetic (our own and Sileane dataset) and real (a public Bin-Picking dataset) data, showing that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 15-31% in average precision. 
### 187.Dual Pattern Learning Networks by Empirical Dual Prediction Risk  Minimization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03902.pdf)
> Motivated by the observation that humans can learn patterns from two given images at one time, we propose a dual pattern learning network architecture in this paper. Unlike conventional networks, the proposed architecture has two input branches and two loss functions. Instead of minimizing the empirical risk of a given dataset, dual pattern learning networks is trained by minimizing the empirical dual prediction loss. We show that this can improve the performance for single image classification. This architecture forces the network to learn discriminative class-specific features by analyzing and comparing two input images. In addition, the dual input structure allows the network to have a considerably large number of image pairs, which can help address the overfitting issue due to limited training data. Moreover, we propose to associate each input branch with a random interest value for learning corresponding image during training. This method can be seen as a stochastic regularization technique, and can further lead to generalization performance improvement. State-of-the-art deep networks can be adapted to dual pattern learning networks without increasing the same number of parameters. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR- 100, FI-8, Google commands dataset, and MNIST demonstrate that our DPLNets exhibit better performance than original networks. The experimental results on subsets of CIFAR- 10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST demonstrate that dual pattern learning networks have good generalization performance on small datasets. 
### 188.Retinal Optic Disc Segmentation using Conditional Generative Adversarial  Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03905.pdf)
> This paper proposed a retinal image segmentation method based on conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to segment optic disc. The proposed model consists of two successive networks: generator and discriminator. The generator learns to map information from the observing input (i.e., retinal fundus color image), to the output (i.e., binary mask). Then, the discriminator learns as a loss function to train this mapping by comparing the ground-truth and the predicted output with observing the input image as a condition.Experiments were performed on two publicly available dataset; DRISHTI GS1 and RIM-ONE. The proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art-methods by achieving around 0.96% and 0.98% of Jaccard and Dice coefficients, respectively. Moreover, an image segmentation is performed in less than a second on recent GPU. 
### 189.AGIL: Learning Attention from Human for Visuomotor Tasks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03960.pdf)
> When intelligent agents learn visuomotor behaviors from human demonstrations, they may benefit from knowing where the human is allocating visual attention, which can be inferred from their gaze. A wealth of information regarding intelligent decision making is conveyed by human gaze allocation; hence, exploiting such information has the potential to improve the agents' performance. With this motivation, we propose the AGIL (Attention Guided Imitation Learning) framework. We collect high-quality human action and gaze data while playing Atari games in a carefully controlled experimental setting. Using these data, we first train a deep neural network that can predict human gaze positions and visual attention with high accuracy (the gaze network) and then train another network to predict human actions (the policy network). Incorporating the learned attention model from the gaze network into the policy network significantly improves the action prediction accuracy and task performance. 
### 190.Attention Incorporate Network: A network can adapt various data size [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03961.pdf)
> In traditional neural networks for image processing, the inputs of the neural networks should be the same size such as 224*224*3. But how can we train the neural net model with different input size? A common way to do is image deformation which accompany a problem of information loss (e.g. image crop or wrap). Sequence model(RNN, LSTM, etc.) can accept different size of input like text and audio. But one disadvantage for sequence model is that the previous information will become more fragmentary during the transfer in time step, it will make the network hard to train especially for long sequential data. In this paper we propose a new network structure called Attention Incorporate Network(AIN). It solve the problem of different size of inputs including: images, text, audio, and extract the key features of the inputs by attention mechanism, pay different attention depends on the importance of the features not rely on the data size. Experimentally, AIN achieve a higher accuracy, better convergence comparing to the same size of other network structure 
### 191.Rotation Equivariant CNNs for Digital Pathology [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03962.pdf)
> We propose a new model for digital pathology segmentation, based on the observation that histopathology images are inherently symmetric under rotation and reflection. Utilizing recent findings on rotation equivariant CNNs, the proposed model leverages these symmetries in a principled manner. We present a visual analysis showing improved stability on predictions, and demonstrate that exploiting rotation equivariance significantly improves tumor detection performance on a challenging lymph node metastases dataset. We further present a novel derived dataset to enable principled comparison of machine learning models, in combination with an initial benchmark. Through this dataset, the task of histopathology diagnosis becomes accessible as a challenging benchmark for fundamental machine learning research. 
### 192.Neural Proximal Gradient Descent for Compressive Imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03963.pdf)
> Recovering high-resolution images from limited sensory data typically leads to a serious ill-posed inverse problem, demanding inversion algorithms that effectively capture the prior information. Learning a good inverse mapping from training data faces severe challenges, including: (i) scarcity of training data; (ii) need for plausible reconstructions that are physically feasible; (iii) need for fast reconstruction, especially in real-time applications. We develop a successful system solving all these challenges, using as basic architecture the recurrent application of proximal gradient algorithm. We learn a proximal map that works well with real images based on residual networks. Contraction of the resulting map is analyzed, and incoherence conditions are investigated that drive the convergence of the iterates. Extensive experiments are carried out under different settings: (a) reconstructing abdominal MRI of pediatric patients from highly undersampled Fourier-space data and (b) superresolving natural face images. Our key findings include: 1. a recurrent ResNet with a single residual block unrolled from an iterative algorithm yields an effective proximal which accurately reveals MR image details. 2. Our architecture significantly outperforms conventional non-recurrent deep ResNets by 2dB SNR; it is also trained much more rapidly. 3. It outperforms state-of-the-art compressed-sensing Wavelet-based methods by 4dB SNR, with 100x speedups in reconstruction time. 
### 193.CapsGAN: Using Dynamic Routing for Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03968.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel technique for generating images in the 3D domain from images with high degree of geometrical transformations. By coalescing two popular concurrent methods that have seen rapid ascension to the machine learning zeitgeist in recent years: GANs (Goodfellow et. al.) and Capsule networks (Sabour, Hinton et. al.) - we present: \textbf{CapsGAN}. We show that CapsGAN performs better than or equal to traditional CNN based GANs in generating images with high geometric transformations using rotated MNIST. In the process, we also show the efficacy of using capsules architecture in the GANs domain. Furthermore, we tackle the Gordian Knot in training GANs - the performance control and training stability by experimenting with using Wasserstein distance (gradient clipping, penalty) and Spectral Normalization. The experimental findings of this paper should propel the application of capsules and GANs in the still exciting and nascent domain of 3D image generation, and plausibly video (frame) generation. 
### 194.End to End Brain Fiber Orientation Estimation using Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03969.pdf)
> In this work, we explore the various Brain Neuron tracking techniques, which is one of the most significant applications of Diffusion Tensor Imaging. Tractography provides us with a non-invasive method to analyze underlying tissue micro-structure. Understanding the structure and organization of the tissues facilitates us with a diagnosis method to identify any aberrations and provide acute information on the occurrences of brain ischemia or stroke, the mutation of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer, multiple sclerosis and so on. Time if of essence and accurate localization of the aberrations can help save or change a diseased life. Following up with the limitations introduced by the current Tractography techniques such as computational complexity, reconstruction errors during tensor estimation and standardization, we aim to elucidate these limitations through our research findings. We introduce an end to end Deep Learning framework which can accurately estimate the most probable likelihood orientation at each voxel along a neuronal pathway. We use Probabilistic Tractography as our baseline model to obtain the training data and which also serve as a Tractography Gold Standard for our evaluations. Through experiments we show that our Deep Network can do a significant improvement over current Tractography implementations by reducing the run-time complexity to a significant new level. Our architecture also allows for variable sized input DWI signals eliminating the need to worry about memory issues as seen with the traditional techniques. The advantage of this architecture is that it is perfectly desirable to be processed on a cloud setup and utilize the existing multi GPU frameworks to perform whole brain Tractography in minutes rather than hours. We evaluate our network with Gold Standard and benchmark its performance across several parameters. 
### 195.State Classification with CNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03973.pdf)
> There is a plenty of research going on in field of object recognition, but object state recognition has not been addressed as much. There are many important applications which can utilize object state recognition, such as, in robotics, to decide for how to grab an object. A convolution neural network was designed to classify an image to one of its states. The approach used for training is transfer learning with Inception v3 module of GoogLeNet used as the pre-trained model. The model was trained on images of 18 cooking objects and tested on another set of cooking objects. The model was able to classify those images with 76% accuracy. 
### 196.Rethinking Radiology: An Analysis of Different Approaches to BraTS [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03981.pdf)
> This paper discusses the deep learning architectures currently used for pixel-wise segmentation of primary and secondary glioblastomas and low-grade gliomas. We implement various models such as the popular UNet architecture and compare the performance of these implementations on the BRATS dataset. This paper will explore the different approaches and combinations, offering an in depth discussion of how they perform and how we may improve upon them using more recent advancements in deep learning architectures. 
### 197.Quantitative Phase Imaging and Artificial Intelligence: A Review [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03982.pdf)
> Recent advances in quantitative phase imaging (QPI) and artificial intelligence (AI) have opened up the possibility of an exciting frontier. The fast and label-free nature of QPI enables the rapid generation of large-scale and uniform-quality imaging data in two, three, and four dimensions. Subsequently, the AI-assisted interrogation of QPI data using data-driven machine learning techniques results in a variety of biomedical applications. Also, machine learning enhances QPI itself. Herein, we review the synergy between QPI and machine learning with a particular focus on deep learning. Further, we provide practical guidelines and perspectives for further development. 
### 198.Writing Style Invariant Deep Learning Model for Historical Manuscripts  Alignment [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03987.pdf)
> Historical manuscript alignment is a widely known problem in document analysis. Finding the differences between manuscript editions is mostly done manually. In this paper, we present a writer independent deep learning model which is trained on several writing styles, and able to achieve high detection accuracy when tested on writing styles not present in training data. We test our model using cross validation, each time we train the model on five manuscripts, and test it on the other two manuscripts, never seen in the training data. We've applied cross validation on seven manuscripts, netting 21 different tests, achieving average accuracy of $\%92.17$. We also present a new alignment algorithm based on dynamic sized sliding window, which is able to successfully handle complex cases. 
### 199.Real-time coherent diffraction inversion using deep generative networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03992.pdf)
> Phase retrieval, or the process of recovering phase information in reciprocal space to reconstruct images from measured intensity alone, is the underlying basis to a variety of imaging applications including coherent diffraction imaging (CDI). Typical phase retrieval algorithms are iterative in nature, and hence, are time-consuming and computationally expensive, precluding real-time imaging. Furthermore, iterative phase retrieval algorithms struggle to converge to the correct solution especially in the presence of strong phase structures. In this work, we demonstrate the training and testing of CDI NN, a pair of deep deconvolutional networks trained to predict structure and phase in real space of a 2D object from its corresponding far-field diffraction intensities alone. Once trained, CDI NN can invert a diffraction pattern to an image within a few milliseconds of compute time on a standard desktop machine, opening the door to real-time imaging. 
### 200.Learning to Estimate Indoor Lighting from 3D Objects [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03994.pdf)
> In this work, we propose a step towards a more accurate prediction of the environment light given a single picture of a known object. To achieve this, we developed a deep learning method that is able to encode the latent space of indoor lighting using few parameters and that is trained on a database of environment maps. This latent space is then used to generate predictions of the light that are both more realistic and accurate than previous methods. To achieve this, our first contribution is a deep autoencoder which is capable of learning the feature space that compactly models lighting. Our second contribution is a convolutional neural network that predicts the light from a single image of a known object. To train these networks, our third contribution is a novel dataset that contains 21,000 HDR indoor environment maps. The results indicate that the predictor can generate plausible lighting estimations even from diffuse objects. 
### 201.Contextual Hourglass Networks for Segmentation and Density Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04009.pdf)
> Hourglass networks such as the U-Net and V-Net are popular neural architectures for medical image segmentation and counting problems. Typical instances of hourglass networks contain shortcut connections between mirroring layers. These shortcut connections improve the performance and it is hypothesized that this is due to mitigating effects on the vanishing gradient problem and the ability of the model to combine feature maps from earlier and later layers. We propose a method for not only combining feature maps of mirroring layers but also feature maps of layers with different spatial dimensions. For instance, the method enables the integration of the bottleneck feature map with those of the reconstruction layers. The proposed approach is applicable to any hourglass architecture. We evaluated the contextual hourglass networks on image segmentation and object counting problems in the medical domain. We achieve competitive results outperforming popular hourglass networks by up to 17 percentage points. 
### 202.Fully automated primary particle size analysis of agglomerates on  transmission electron microscopy images via artificial neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04010.pdf)
> There is a high demand for fully automated methods for the analysis of primary particle size distributions of agglomerates on transmission electron microscopy images. Therefore, a novel method, based on the utilization of artificial neural networks, was proposed, implemented and validated. The training of the artificial neural networks requires large quantities (up to several hundreds of thousands) of transmission electron microscopy images of agglomerates consisting of primary particles with known sizes. Since the manual evaluation of such large amounts of transmission electron microscopy images is not feasible, a synthesis of lifelike transmission electron microscopy images as training data was implemented. The proposed method can compete with state-of-the-art automated imaging particle size methods like the Hough transformation, ultimate erosion and watershed transformation and is in some cases even able to outperform these methods. It is however still outperformed by the manual analysis. 
### 203.Hierarchy of GANs for learning embodied self-awareness model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04012.pdf)
> In recent years several architectures have been proposed to learn embodied agents complex self-awareness models. In this paper, dynamic incremental self-awareness (SA) models are proposed that allow experiences done by an agent to be modeled in a hierarchical fashion, starting from more simple situations to more structured ones. Each situation is learned from subsets of private agent perception data as a model capable to predict normal behaviors and detect abnormalities. Hierarchical SA models have been already proposed using low dimensional sensorial inputs. In this work, a hierarchical model is introduced by means of a cross-modal Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) processing high dimensional visual data. Different levels of the GANs are detected in a self-supervised manner using GANs discriminators decision boundaries. Real experiments on semi-autonomous ground vehicles are presented. 
### 204.Sheep identity recognition, age and weight estimation datasets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04017.pdf)
> Increased interest of scientists, producers and consumers in sheep identification has been stimulated by the dramatic increase in population and the urge to increase productivity. The world population is expected to exceed 9.6 million in 2050. For this reason, awareness is raised towards the necessity of effective livestock production. Sheep is considered as one of the main of food resources. Most of the research now is directed towards developing real time applications that facilitate sheep identification for breed management and gathering related information like weight and age. Weight and age are key matrices in assessing the effectiveness of production. For this reason, visual analysis proved recently its significant success over other approaches. Visual analysis techniques need enough images for testing and study completion. For this reason, collecting sheep images database is a vital step to fulfill such objective. We provide here datasets for testing and comparing such algorithms which are under development. Our collected dataset consists of 416 color images for different features of sheep in different postures. Images were collected fifty two sheep at a range of year from three months to six years. For each sheep, two images were captured for both sides of the body, two images for both sides of the face, one image from the top view, one image for the hip and one image for the teeth. The collected images cover different illumination, quality levels and angle of rotation. The allocated data set can be used to test sheep identification, weigh estimation, and age detection algorithms. Such algorithms are crucial for disease management, animal assessment and ownership. 
### 205.CT-Realistic Lung Nodule Simulation from 3D Conditional Generative  Adversarial Networks for Robust Lung Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04051.pdf)
> Data availability plays a critical role for the performance of deep learning systems. This challenge is especially acute within the medical image domain, particularly when pathologies are involved, due to two factors: 1) limited number of cases, and 2) large variations in location, scale, and appearance. In this work, we investigate whether augmenting a dataset with artificially generated lung nodules can improve the robustness of the progressive holistically nested network (P-HNN) model for pathological lung segmentation of CT scans. To achieve this goal, we develop a 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) that effectively learns lung nodule property distributions in 3D space. In order to embed the nodules within their background context, we condition the GAN based on a volume of interest whose central part containing the nodule has been erased. To further improve realism and blending with the background, we propose a novel multi-mask reconstruction loss. We train our method on over 1000 nodules from the LIDC dataset. Qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-art. We then use our GAN to generate simulated training images where nodules lie on the lung border, which are cases where the published P-HNN model struggles. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that armed with these simulated images, the P-HNN model learns to better segment lung regions under these challenging situations. As a result, our system provides a promising means to help overcome the data paucity that commonly afflicts medical imaging. 
### 206.Joint Learning of Motion Estimation and Segmentation for Cardiac MR  Image Sequences [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04066.pdf)
> Cardiac motion estimation and segmentation play important roles in quantitatively assessing cardiac function and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method for joint estimation of motion and segmentation from cardiac MR image sequences. The proposed network consists of two branches: a cardiac motion estimation branch which is built on a novel unsupervised Siamese style recurrent spatial transformer network, and a cardiac segmentation branch that is based on a fully convolutional network. In particular, a joint multi-scale feature encoder is learned by optimizing the segmentation branch and the motion estimation branch simultaneously. This enables the weakly-supervised segmentation by taking advantage of features that are unsupervisedly learned in the motion estimation branch from a large amount of unannotated data. Experimental results using cardiac MRI images from 220 subjects show that the joint learning of both tasks is complementary and the proposed models outperform the competing methods significantly in terms of accuracy and speed. 
### 207.Semantically Selective Augmentation for Deep Compact Person  Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04074.pdf)
> We present a deep person re-identification approach that combines semantically selective, deep data augmentation with clustering-based network compression to generate high performance, light and fast inference networks. In particular, we propose to augment limited training data via sampling from a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN), whose discriminator is constrained by a semantic classifier to explicitly control the domain specificity of the generation process. Thereby, we encode information in the classifier network which can be utilized to steer adversarial synthesis, and which fuels our CondenseNet ID-network training. We provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the approach and its variants on a number of datasets, obtaining results that outperform the state-of-the-art on the LIMA dataset for long-term monitoring in indoor living spaces. 
### 208.Synthetic Depth-of-Field with a Single-Camera Mobile Phone [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04171.pdf)
> Shallow depth-of-field is commonly used by photographers to isolate a subject from a distracting background. However, standard cell phone cameras cannot produce such images optically, as their short focal lengths and small apertures capture nearly all-in-focus images. We present a system to computationally synthesize shallow depth-of-field images with a single mobile camera and a single button press. If the image is of a person, we use a person segmentation network to separate the person and their accessories from the background. If available, we also use dense dual-pixel auto-focus hardware, effectively a 2-sample light field with an approximately 1 millimeter baseline, to compute a dense depth map. These two signals are combined and used to render a defocused image. Our system can process a 5.4 megapixel image in 4 seconds on a mobile phone, is fully automatic, and is robust enough to be used by non-experts. The modular nature of our system allows it to degrade naturally in the absence of a dual-pixel sensor or a human subject. 
### 209.3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Functional  Connectomes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04209.pdf)
> Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans hold the potential to serve as a diagnostic or prognostic tool for a wide variety of conditions, such as autism, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. While a growing number of studies have demonstrated the promise of machine learning algorithms for rs-fMRI based clinical or behavioral prediction, most prior models have been limited in their capacity to exploit the richness of the data. For example, classification techniques applied to rs-fMRI often rely on region-based summary statistics and/or linear models. In this work, we propose a novel volumetric Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework that takes advantage of the full-resolution 3D spatial structure of rs-fMRI data and fits non-linear predictive models. We showcase our approach on a challenging large-scale dataset (ABIDE, with N &gt; 2,000) and report state-of-the-art accuracy results on rs-fMRI-based discrimination of autism patients and healthy controls. 
### 210.NeuroNet: Fast and Robust Reproduction of Multiple Brain Image  Segmentation Pipelines [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04224.pdf)
> NeuroNet is a deep convolutional neural network mimicking multiple popular and state-of-the-art brain segmentation tools including FSL, SPM, and MALPEM. The network is trained on 5,000 T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank Imaging Study that have been automatically segmented into brain tissue and cortical and sub-cortical structures using the standard neuroimaging pipelines. Training a single model from these complementary and partially overlapping label maps yields a new powerful "all-in-one", multi-output segmentation tool. The processing time for a single subject is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to running each individual software package. We demonstrate very good reproducibility of the original outputs while increasing robustness to variations in the input data. We believe NeuroNet could be an important tool in large-scale population imaging studies and serve as a new standard in neuroscience by reducing the risk of introducing bias when choosing a specific software package. 
### 211.Improving Whole Slide Segmentation Through Visual Context - A Systematic  Study [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04259.pdf)
> While challenging, the dense segmentation of histology images is a necessary first step to assess changes in tissue architecture and cellular morphology. Although specific convolutional neural network architectures have been applied with great success to the problem, few effectively incorporate visual context information from multiple scales. With this paper, we present a systematic comparison of different architectures to assess how including multi-scale information affects segmentation performance. A publicly available breast cancer and a locally collected prostate cancer datasets are being utilised for this study. The results support our hypothesis that visual context and scale play a crucial role in histology image classification problems. 
### 212.Accurate and Robust Neural Networks for Security Related Applications  Exampled by Face Morphing Attacks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04265.pdf)
> Artificial neural networks tend to learn only what they need for a task. A manipulation of the training data can counter this phenomenon. In this paper, we study the effect of different alterations of the training data, which limit the amount and position of information that is available for the decision making. We analyze the accuracy and robustness against semantic and black box attacks on the networks that were trained on different training data modifications for the particular example of morphing attacks. A morphing attack is an attack on a biometric facial recognition system where the system is fooled to match two different individuals with the same synthetic face image. Such a synthetic image can be created by aligning and blending images of the two individuals that should be matched with this image. 
### 213.3D Pose Estimation for Fine-Grained Object Categories [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04314.pdf)
> Existing object pose estimation datasets are related to generic object types and there is so far no dataset for fine-grained object categories. In this work, we introduce a new large dataset to benchmark pose estimation for fine-grained objects, thanks to the availability of both 2D and 3D fine-grained data recently. Specifically, we augment two popular fine-grained recognition datasets (StanfordCars and CompCars) by finding a fine-grained 3D CAD model for each sub-category and manually annotating each object in images with 3D pose. We show that, with enough training data, a full perspective model with continuous parameters can be estimated using 2D appearance information alone. We achieve this via a framework based on Faster/Mask R-CNN. This goes beyond previous works on category-level pose estimation, which only estimate discrete/continuous viewpoint angles or recover rotation matrices often with the help of key points. Furthermore, with fine-grained 3D models available, we incorporate a novel 3D representation named as location field into the CNN-based pose estimation framework to further improve the performance. 
### 214.Sparse, Collaborative, or Nonnegative Representation: Which Helps  Pattern Classification? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04329.pdf)
> The use of sparse representation (SR) and collaborative representation (CR) for pattern classification has been widely studied in tasks such as face recognition and object categorization. Despite the success of SR/CR based classifiers, it is still arguable whether it is the $\ell_{1}$-norm sparsity or the $\ell_{2}$-norm collaborative property that brings the success of SR/CR based classification. In this paper, we investigate the use of nonnegative representation (NR) for pattern classification, which is largely ignored by previous work. Our analyses reveal that NR can boost the representation power of homogeneous samples while limiting the representation power of heterogeneous samples, making the representation sparse and discriminative simultaneously and thus providing a more effective solution to representation based classification than SR/CR. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed NR based classifier (NRC) outperforms previous representation based classifiers. With deep features as inputs, it also achieves state-of-the-art performance on various visual classification tasks. 
### 215.Automatic Ship Detection of Remote Sensing Images from Google Earth in  Complex Scenes Based on Multi-Scale Rotation Dense Feature Pyramid Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04331.pdf)
> Ship detection has been playing a significant role in the field of remote sensing for a long time but it is still full of challenges. The main limitations of traditional ship detection methods usually lie in the complexity of application scenarios, the difficulty of intensive object detection and the redundancy of detection region. In order to solve such problems above, we propose a framework called Rotation Dense Feature Pyramid Networks (R-DFPN) which can effectively detect ship in different scenes including ocean and port. Specifically, we put forward the Dense Feature Pyramid Network (DFPN), which is aimed at solving the problem resulted from the narrow width of the ship. Compared with previous multi-scale detectors such as Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), DFPN builds the high-level semantic feature-maps for all scales by means of dense connections, through which enhances the feature propagation and encourages the feature reuse. Additionally, in the case of ship rotation and dense arrangement, we design a rotation anchor strategy to predict the minimum circumscribed rectangle of the object so as to reduce the redundant detection region and improve the recall. Furthermore, we also propose multi-scale ROI Align for the purpose of maintaining the completeness of semantic and spatial information. Experiments based on remote sensing images from Google Earth for ship detection show that our detection method based on R-DFPN representation has a state-of-the-art performance. 
### 216.MSplit LBI: Realizing Feature Selection and Dense Estimation  Simultaneously in Few-shot and Zero-shot Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04360.pdf)
> It is one typical and general topic of learning a good embedding model to efficiently learn the representation coefficients between two spaces/subspaces. To solve this task, $L_{1}$ regularization is widely used for the pursuit of feature selection and avoiding overfitting, and yet the sparse estimation of features in $L_{1}$ regularization may cause the underfitting of training data. $L_{2}$ regularization is also frequently used, but it is a biased estimator. In this paper, we propose the idea that the features consist of three orthogonal parts, \emph{namely} sparse strong signals, dense weak signals and random noise, in which both strong and weak signals contribute to the fitting of data. To facilitate such novel decomposition, \emph{MSplit} LBI is for the first time proposed to realize feature selection and dense estimation simultaneously. We provide theoretical and simulational verification that our method exceeds $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ regularization, and extensive experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the few-shot and zero-shot learning. 
### 217.Qiniu Submission to ActivityNet Challenge 2018 [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04391.pdf)
> In this paper, we introduce our submissions for the tasks of trimmed activity recognition (Kinetics) and trimmed event recognition (Moments in Time) for Activitynet Challenge 2018. In the two tasks, non-local neural networks and temporal segment networks are implemented as our base models. Multi-modal cues such as RGB image, optical flow and acoustic signal have also been used in our method. We also propose new non-local-based models for further improvement on the recognition accuracy. The final submissions after ensembling the models achieve 83.5% top-1 accuracy and 96.8% top-5 accuracy on the Kinetics validation set, 35.81% top-1 accuracy and 62.59% top-5 accuracy on the MIT validation set. 
### 218.Enhancing clinical MRI Perfusion maps with data-driven maps of  complementary nature for lesion outcome prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04413.pdf)
> Stroke is the second most common cause of death in developed countries, where rapid clinical intervention can have a major impact on a patient's life. To perform the revascularization procedure, the decision making of physicians considers its risks and benefits based on multi-modal MRI and clinical experience. Therefore, automatic prediction of the ischemic stroke lesion outcome has the potential to assist the physician towards a better stroke assessment and information about tissue outcome. Typically, automatic methods consider the information of the standard kinetic models of diffusion and perfusion MRI (e.g. Tmax, TTP, MTT, rCBF, rCBV) to perform lesion outcome prediction. In this work, we propose a deep learning method to fuse this information with an automated data selection of the raw 4D PWI image information, followed by a data-driven deep-learning modeling of the underlying blood flow hemodynamics. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to improve prediction of tissue at risk before therapy, as compared to only using the standard clinical perfusion maps, hence suggesting on the potential benefits of the proposed data-driven raw perfusion data modelling approach. 
### 219.Sample Dropout for Audio Scene Classification Using Multi-Scale Dense  Connected Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04422.pdf)
> Acoustic scene classification is an intricate problem for a machine. As an emerging field of research, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) achieve convincing results. In this paper, we explore the use of multi-scale Dense connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet) for the classification task, with the goal to improve the classification performance as multi-scale features can be extracted from the time-frequency representation of the audio signal. On the other hand, most of previous CNN-based audio scene classification approaches aim to improve the classification accuracy, by employing different regularization techniques, such as the dropout of hidden units and data augmentation, to reduce overfitting. It is widely known that outliers in the training set have a high negative influence on the trained model, and culling the outliers may improve the classification performance, while it is often under-explored in previous studies. In this paper, inspired by the silence removal in the speech signal processing, a novel sample dropout approach is proposed, which aims to remove outliers in the training dataset. Using the DCASE 2017 audio scene classification datasets, the experimental results demonstrates the proposed multi-scale DenseNet providing a superior performance than the traditional single-scale DenseNet, while the sample dropout method can further improve the classification robustness of multi-scale DenseNet. 
### 220.U-SegNet: Fully Convolutional Neural Network based Automated Brain  tissue segmentation Tool [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04429.pdf)
> Automated brain tissue segmentation into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) from magnetic resonance images (MRI) is helpful in the diagnosis of neuro-disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, etc. However, thin GM structures at the periphery of cortex and smooth transitions on tissue boundaries such as between GM and WM, or WM and CSF pose difficulty in building a reliable segmentation tool. This paper proposes a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) tool, that is a hybrid of two widely used deep learning segmentation architectures SegNet and U-Net, for improved brain tissue segmentation. We propose a skip connection inspired from U-Net, in the SegNet architetcure, to incorporate fine multiscale information for better tissue boundary identification. We show that the proposed U-SegNet architecture, improves segmentation performance, as measured by average dice ratio, to 89.74% on the widely used IBSR dataset consisting of T-1 weighted MRI volumes of 18 subjects. 
### 221.Cross-dataset Person Re-Identification Using Similarity Preserved  Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04533.pdf)
> Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match the image frames which contain the same person in the surveillance videos. Most of the Re-ID algorithms conduct supervised training in some small labeled datasets, so directly deploying these trained models to the real-world large camera networks may lead to a poor performance due to underfitting. The significant difference between the source training dataset and the target testing dataset makes it challenging to incrementally optimize the model. To address this challenge, we propose a novel solution by transforming the unlabeled images in the target domain to fit the original classifier by using our proposed similarity preserved generative adversarial networks model, SimPGAN. Specifically, SimPGAN adopts the generative adversarial networks with the cycle consistency constraint to transform the unlabeled images in the target domain to the style of the source domain. Meanwhile, SimPGAN uses the similarity consistency loss, which is measured by a siamese deep convolutional neural network, to preserve the similarity of the transformed images of the same person. Comprehensive experiments based on multiple real surveillance datasets are conducted, and the results show that our algorithm is better than the state-of-the-art cross-dataset unsupervised person Re-ID algorithms. 
### 222.Learning Deep Similarity Metric for 3D MR-TRUS Registration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04548.pdf)
> Purpose: The fusion of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and magnetic resonance (MR) images for guiding targeted prostate biopsy has significantly improved the biopsy yield of aggressive cancers. A key component of MR-TRUS fusion is image registration. However, it is very challenging to obtain a robust automatic MR-TRUS registration due to the large appearance difference between the two imaging modalities. The work presented in this paper aims to tackle this problem by addressing two challenges: (i) the definition of a suitable similarity metric and (ii) the determination of a suitable optimization strategy. <br />Methods: This work proposes the use of a deep convolutional neural network to learn a suitable similarity metric. We also use a composite optimization strategy to explore the solution space for optimizing the learned metric for image registration. <br />Results: The learned similarity metric outperforms mutual information and the results indicate that the overall registration framework has a large capture range. The proposed deep similarity metric based approach obtained the mean TRE of 4.24mm (with an initial TRE of 16mm) for this challenging problem. <br />Conclusion: Learned metric based on deep learning can be used to assess the quality of any given image registration and can be used in conjunction with the aforementioned optimization framework to perform automatic registration that is robust to poor initialization. 
### 223.Detection of Premature Ventricular Contractions Using Densely Connected  Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Spatial Pyramid Pooling Layer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04564.pdf)
> Premature ventricular contraction(PVC) is a type of premature ectopic beat originating from the ventricles. Automatic method for accurate and robust detection of PVC is highly clinically desired.Currently, most of these methods are developed and tested using the same database divided into training and testing set and their generalization performance across databases has not been fully validated. In this paper, a method based on densely connected convolutional neural network and spatial pyramid pooling is proposed for PVC detection which can take arbitrarily-sized QRS complexes as input both in training and testing. With a much less complicated and more straightforward architecture,the proposed network achieves comparable results to current state-of-the-art deep learning based method with regard to accuracy,sensitivity and specificity by training and testing using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database as benchmark.Besides the benchmark database,QRS complexes are extracted from four more open databases namely the St-Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Technics 12-lead Arrhythmia Database,The MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database,The MIT-BIH Long Term Database and European ST-T Database. The extracted QRS complexes are different in length and sampling rate among the five databases.Cross-database training and testing is also experimented.The performance of the network shows an improvement on the benchmark database according to the result demonstrating the advantage of using multiple databases for training over using only a single database.The network also achieves satisfactory scores on the other four databases showing good generalization capability. 
### 224.Multiview Two-Task Recursive Attention Model for Left Atrium and Atrial  Scars Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04597.pdf)
> Late Gadolinium Enhanced Cardiac MRI (LGE-CMRI) for detecting atrial scars in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients has recently emerged as a promising technique to stratify patients, guide ablation therapy and predict treatment success. Visualisation and quantification of scar tissues require a segmentation of both the left atrium (LA) and the high intensity scar regions from LGE-CMRI images. These two segmentation tasks are challenging due to the cancelling of healthy tissue signal, low signal-to-noise ratio and often limited image quality in these patients. Most approaches require manual supervision and/or a second bright-blood MRI acquisition for anatomical segmentation. Segmenting both the LA anatomy and the scar tissues automatically from a single LGE-CMRI acquisition is highly in demand. In this study, we proposed a novel fully automated multiview two-task (MVTT) recursive attention model working directly on LGE-CMRI images that combines a sequential learning and a dilated residual learning to segment the LA (including attached pulmonary veins) and delineate the atrial scars simultaneously via an innovative attention model. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed MVTT achieves compelling improvement, enabling to generate a patient-specific anatomical and atrial scar assessment model. 
### 225.Dictionary Learning for Adaptive GPR Target Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04599.pdf)
> Ground penetrating radar (GPR) target detection and classification is a challenging task. Here, we consider various online dictionary learning (DL) methods to obtain sparse representation (SR) of the GPR data to enhance feature extraction for target classification via support vector machine. Online methods are preferred because traditional batch DL like K-SVD is not scalable to high-dimensional training sets and infeasible for real-time operation. We also develop Drop-Off MINi-batch Online Dictionary Learning (DOMINODL) which exploits the fact that a lot of the training data may be correlated. The DOMINODL algorithm iteratively considers elements of the training set in small batches and drops off samples which become less relevant. For the case of abandoned anti-personnel landmines classification, we compare the performance of K-SVD with three online algorithms: classical Online Dictionary Learning, its correlation-based variant and DOMINODL. Our experiments with real data from L-band GPR show that online DL methods reduce learning time by 36-93% and increase mine detection by 4-28% over K-SVD. Our DOMINODL is the fastest and retains similar classification performance as the other two online DL approaches. We use a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test distance and the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality for the selection of DL input parameters leading to enhanced classification results. To further compare with state-of-the art classification approaches, we evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier which performs worse than the proposed approach. Moreover, when the acquired samples are randomly reduced by 25%, 50% and 75%, sparse decomposition based classification with DL remains robust while the CNN accuracy is drastically compromised. 
### 226.Knowledge Distillation by On-the-Fly Native Ensemble [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04606.pdf)
> Knowledge distillation is effective to train small and generalisable network models for meeting the low-memory and fast running requirements. Existing offline distillation methods rely on a strong pre-trained teacher, which enables favourable knowledge discovery and transfer but requires a complex two-phase training procedure. Online counterparts address this limitation at the price of lacking a highcapacity teacher. In this work, we present an On-the-fly Native Ensemble (ONE) strategy for one-stage online distillation. Specifically, ONE trains only a single multi-branch network while simultaneously establishing a strong teacher on-the- fly to enhance the learning of target network. Extensive evaluations show that ONE improves the generalisation performance a variety of deep neural networks more significantly than alternative methods on four image classification dataset: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and ImageNet, whilst having the computational efficiency advantages. 
### 227.A Hierarchical Fuzzy System for an Advanced Driving Assistance System [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04611.pdf)
> In this study, we present a hierarchical fuzzy system by evaluating the risk state for a Driver Assistance System in order to contribute in reducing the road accident's number. A key component of this system is its ability to continually detect and test the inside and outside risks in real time: The outside car risks by detecting various road moving objects; this proposed system stands on computer vision approaches. The inside risks by presenting an automatic system for drowsy driving identification or detection by evaluating EEG signals of the driver; this developed system is based on computer vision techniques and biometrics factors (electroencephalogram EEG). This proposed system is then composed of three main modules. The first module is responsible for identifying the driver drowsiness state through his eye movements (physical drowsiness). The second one is responsible for detecting and analysing his physiological signals to also identify his drowsiness state (moral drowsiness). The third module is responsible to evaluate the road driving risks by detecting of the road different moving objects in a real time. The final decision will be obtained by merging of the three detection systems through the use of fuzzy decision rules. Finally, the proposed approach has been improved on ten samples from a proposed dataset. 
### 228.Imperfect Segmentation Labels: How Much Do They Matter? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04618.pdf)
> Labeled datasets for semantic segmentation are imperfect, especially in medical imaging where borders are often subtle or ill-defined. Little work has been done to analyze the effect that label errors have on the performance of segmentation methodologies. Here we present a large-scale study of model performance in the presence of varying types and degrees of error in training data. We trained U-Net, SegNet, and FCN32 several times for liver segmentation with 10 different modes of ground-truth perturbation. Our results show that for each architecture, performance steadily declines with boundary-localized errors, however, U-Net was significantly more robust to jagged boundary errors than the other architectures. We also found that each architecture was very robust to non-boundary-localized errors, suggesting that boundary-localized errors are fundamentally different and more challenging problem than random label errors in a classification setting. 
### 229.Fast forwarding Egocentric Videos by Listening and Watching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04620.pdf)
> The remarkable technological advance in well-equipped wearable devices is pushing an increasing production of long first-person videos. However, since most of these videos have long and tedious parts, they are forgotten or never seen. Despite a large number of techniques proposed to fast-forward these videos by highlighting relevant moments, most of them are image based only. Most of these techniques disregard other relevant sensors present in the current devices such as high-definition microphones. In this work, we propose a new approach to fast-forward videos using psychoacoustic metrics extracted from the soundtrack. These metrics can be used to estimate the annoyance of a segment allowing our method to emphasize moments of sound pleasantness. The efficiency of our method is demonstrated through qualitative results and quantitative results as far as of speed-up and instability are concerned. 
### 230.Adversarial Attacks on Variational Autoencoders [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04646.pdf)
> Adversarial attacks are malicious inputs that derail machine-learning models. We propose a scheme to attack autoencoders, as well as a quantitative evaluation framework that correlates well with the qualitative assessment of the attacks. We assess --- with statistically validated experiments --- the resistance to attacks of three variational autoencoders (simple, convolutional, and DRAW) in three datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CelebA), showing that both DRAW's recurrence and attention mechanism lead to better resistance. As autoencoders are proposed for compressing data --- a scenario in which their safety is paramount --- we expect more attention will be given to adversarial attacks on them. 
### 231.Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation by Iteratively Mining Common  Object Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04659.pdf)
> Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation under image tags supervision is a challenging task as it directly associates high-level semantic to low-level appearance. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose an iterative bottom-up and top-down framework which alternatively expands object regions and optimizes segmentation network. We start from initial localization produced by classification networks. While classification networks are only responsive to small and coarse discriminative object regions, we argue that, these regions contain significant common features about objects. So in the bottom-up step, we mine common object features from the initial localization and expand object regions with the mined features. To supplement non-discriminative regions, saliency maps are then considered under Bayesian framework to refine the object regions. Then in the top-down step, the refined object regions are used as supervision to train the segmentation network and to predict object masks. These object masks provide more accurate localization and contain more regions of object. Further, we take these object masks as initial localization and mine common object features from them. These processes are conducted iteratively to progressively produce fine object masks and optimize segmentation networks. Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. 
### 232.Accurate Detection of Inner Ears in Head CTs Using a Deep  Volume-to-Volume Regression Network with False Positive Suppression and a  Shape-Based Constraint [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04725.pdf)
> Cochlear implants (CIs) are neural prosthetics which are used to treat patients with hearing loss. CIs use an array of electrodes which are surgically inserted into the cochlea to stimulate the auditory nerve endings. After surgery, CIs need to be programmed. Studies have shown that the spatial relationship between the intra-cochlear anatomy and electrodes derived from medical images can guide CI programming and lead to significant improvement in hearing outcomes. However, clinical head CT images are usually obtained from scanners of different brands with different protocols. The field of view thus varies greatly and visual inspection is needed to document their content prior to applying algorithms for electrode localization and intra-cochlear anatomy segmentation. In this work, to determine the presence/absence of inner ears and to accurately localize them in head CTs, we use a volume-to-volume convolutional neural network which can be trained end-to-end to map a raw CT volume to probability maps which indicate inner ear positions. We incorporate a false positive suppression strategy in training and apply a shape-based constraint. We achieve a labeling accuracy of 98.59% and a localization error of 2.45mm. The localization error is significantly smaller than a random forest-based approach that has been proposed recently to perform the same task. 
### 233.RepMet: Representative-based metric learning for classification and  one-shot object detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04728.pdf)
> Distance metric learning (DML) has been successfully applied to object classification, both in the standard regime of rich training data and in the few-shot scenario, where each category is represented by only few examples. In this work, we propose a new method for DML, featuring a joint learning of the embedding space and of the data distribution of the training categories, in a single training process. Our method improves upon leading algorithms for DML-based object classification. Furthermore, it opens the door for a new task in Computer Vision - a few-shot object detection, since the proposed DML architecture can be naturally embedded as the classification head of any standard object detector. In numerous experiments, we achieve state-of-the-art classification results on a variety of fine-grained datasets, and offer the community a benchmark on the few-shot detection task, performed on the Imagenet-LOC dataset. The code will be made available upon acceptance. 
### 234.Delta-encoder: an effective sample synthesis method for few-shot object  recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04734.pdf)
> Learning to classify new categories based on just one or a few examples is a long-standing challenge in modern computer vision. In this work, we proposes a simple yet effective method for few-shot (and one-shot) object recognition. Our approach is based on a modified auto-encoder, denoted Delta-encoder, that learns to synthesize new samples for an unseen category just by seeing few examples from it. The synthesized samples are then used to train a classifier. The proposed approach learns to both extract transferable intra-class deformations, or "deltas", between same-class pairs of training examples, and to apply those deltas to the few provided examples of a novel class (unseen during training) in order to efficiently synthesize samples from that new class. The proposed method improves over the state-of-the-art in one-shot object-recognition and compares favorably in the few-shot case. Upon acceptance code will be made available. 
### 235.Fully Convolutional Network for Melanoma Diagnostics [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04765.pdf)
> This work seeks to determine how modern machine learning techniques may be applied to the previously unexplored topic of melanoma diagnostics using digital pathology. We curated a new dataset of 50 patient cases of cutaneous melanoma using digital pathology. We provide gold standard annotations for three tissue types (tumour, epidermis, and dermis) which are important for the prognostic measurements known as Breslow thickness and Clark level. Then, we devised a novel multi-stride fully convolutional network (FCN) architecture that outperformed other networks trained and evaluated using the same data according to standard metrics. Finally, we trained a model to detect and localize the target tissue types. When processing previously unseen cases, our model's output is qualitatively very similar to the gold standard. In addition to the standard metrics computed as a baseline for our approach, we asked three additional pathologists to measure the Breslow thickness on the network's output. Their responses were diagnostically equivalent to the ground truth measurements, and when removing cases where a measurement was not appropriate, inter-rater reliability (IRR) between the four pathologists was 75.0%. Given the qualitative and quantitative results, it is possible to overcome the discriminative challenges of the skin and tumour anatomy for segmentation using modern machine learning techniques, though more work is required to improve the network's performance on dermis segmentation. Further, we show that it is possible to achieve a level of accuracy required to manually perform the Breslow thickness measurement. 
### 236.Hierarchical Long-term Video Prediction without Supervision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04768.pdf)
> Much of recent research has been devoted to video prediction and generation, yet most of the previous works have demonstrated only limited success in generating videos on short-term horizons. The hierarchical video prediction method by Villegas et al. (2017) is an example of a state-of-the-art method for long-term video prediction, but their method is limited because it requires ground truth annotation of high-level structures (e.g., human joint landmarks) at training time. Our network encodes the input frame, predicts a high-level encoding into the future, and then a decoder with access to the first frame produces the predicted image from the predicted encoding. The decoder also produces a mask that outlines the predicted foreground object (e.g., person) as a by-product. Unlike Villegas et al. (2017), we develop a novel training method that jointly trains the encoder, the predictor, and the decoder together without highlevel supervision; we further improve upon this by using an adversarial loss in the feature space to train the predictor. Our method can predict about 20 seconds into the future and provides better results compared to Denton and Fergus (2018) and Finn et al. (2016) on the Human 3.6M dataset. 
### 237.Convolutional Neural Networks for Aircraft Noise Monitoring [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04779.pdf)
> Air travel is one of the fastest growing modes of transportation, however, the effects of aircraft noise on populations surrounding airports is hindering its growth. In an effort to study and ultimately mitigate the impact that this noise has, many airports continuously monitor the aircraft noise in their surrounding communities. Noise monitoring and analysis is complicated by the fact that aircraft are not the only source of noise. In this work, we show that a Convolutional Neural Network is well-suited for the task of identifying noise events which are not caused by aircraft. Our system achieves an accuracy of 0.970 when trained on 900 manually labeled noise events. Our training data and a TensorFlow implementation of our model are available at <a href="https://github.com/neheller/aircraftnoise.">this https URL</a> 
### 238.BA-Net: Dense Bundle Adjustment Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04807.pdf)
> This paper introduces a neural network to solve the structure-from-motion (SfM) problem via feature bundle adjustment (BA), which explicitly enforces multi-view geometry constraints in the form of feature reprojection error. The whole pipeline is differentiable, so that the network can learn suitable feature representations that make the BA problem more trackable. Furthermore, this work introduces a novel depth parameterization to recover dense per-pixel depth. The network first generates some bases depth maps according to the input image, and optimizes the final depth as a linear combination of these bases via feature BA. The bases depth map generator is also learned via end-to-end training. The whole system nicely combines domain knowledge (i.e. hard-coded multi-view geometry constraints) and machine learning (i.e. feature learning and basis depth map generator learning) to address the challenging SfM problem. Experiments on large scale real data prove the success of the proposed method. 
### 239.Position Detection and Direction Prediction for Arbitrary-Oriented Ships  via Multiscale Rotation Region Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04828.pdf)
> Ship detection is of great importance and full of challenges in the field of remote sensing. The complexity of application scenarios, the redundancy of detection region, and the difficulty of dense ship detection are all the main obstacles that limit the successful operation of traditional methods in ship detection. In this paper, we propose a brand new detection model based on multiscale rotational region convolutional neural network to solve the problems above. This model is mainly consist of five consecutive parts: Dense Feature Pyramid Network (DFPN), adaptive region of interest (ROI) Align, rotational bounding box regression, prow direction prediction and rotational nonmaximum suppression (R-NMS). First of all, the low-level location information and high-level semantic information are fully utilized through multiscale feature networks. Then, we design adaptive ROI Align to obtain high quality proposals which remain complete spatial and semantic information. Unlike most previous approaches, the prediction obtained by our method is the minimum bounding rectangle of the object with less redundant regions. Therefore, rotational region detection framework is more suitable to detect the dense object than traditional detection model. Additionally, we can find the berthing and sailing direction of ship through prediction. A detailed evaluation based on SRSS and DOTA dataset for rotation detection shows that our detection method has a competitive performance. 
### 240.Interpretable Partitioned Embedding for Customized Fashion Outfit  Composition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04845.pdf)
> Intelligent fashion outfit composition becomes more and more popular in these years. Some deep learning based approaches reveal competitive composition recently. However, the unexplainable characteristic makes such deep learning based approach cannot meet the the designer, businesses and consumers' urge to comprehend the importance of different attributes in an outfit composition. To realize interpretable and customized fashion outfit compositions, we propose a partitioned embedding network to learn interpretable representations from clothing items. The overall network architecture consists of three components: an auto-encoder module, a supervised attributes module and a multi-independent module. The auto-encoder module serves to encode all useful information into the embedding. In the supervised attributes module, multiple attributes labels are adopted to ensure that different parts of the overall embedding correspond to different attributes. In the multi-independent module, adversarial operation are adopted to fulfill the mutually independent constraint. With the interpretable and partitioned embedding, we then construct an outfit composition graph and an attribute matching map. Given specified attributes description, our model can recommend a ranked list of outfit composition with interpretable matching scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) the partitioned embedding have unmingled parts which corresponding to different attributes and 2) outfits recommended by our model are more desirable in comparison with the existing methods. 
### 241.Learning Visual Knowledge Memory Networks for Visual Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04860.pdf)
> Visual question answering (VQA) requires joint comprehension of images and natural language questions, where many questions can't be directly or clearly answered from visual content but require reasoning from structured human knowledge with confirmation from visual content. This paper proposes visual knowledge memory network (VKMN) to address this issue, which seamlessly incorporates structured human knowledge and deep visual features into memory networks in an end-to-end learning framework. Comparing to existing methods for leveraging external knowledge for supporting VQA, this paper stresses more on two missing mechanisms. First is the mechanism for integrating visual contents with knowledge facts. VKMN handles this issue by embedding knowledge triples (subject, relation, target) and deep visual features jointly into the visual knowledge features. Second is the mechanism for handling multiple knowledge facts expanding from question and answer pairs. VKMN stores joint embedding using key-value pair structure in the memory networks so that it is easy to handle multiple facts. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves promising results on both VQA v1.0 and v2.0 benchmarks, while outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the knowledge-reasoning related questions. 
### 242.Adversarial Learning with Local Coordinate Coding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04895.pdf)
> Generative adversarial networks (GANs) aim to generate realistic data from some prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian noises). However, such prior distribution is often independent of real data and thus may lose semantic information (e.g., geometric structure or content in images) of data. In practice, the semantic information might be represented by some latent distribution learned from data, which, however, is hard to be used for sampling in GANs. In this paper, rather than sampling from the pre-defined prior distribution, we propose a Local Coordinate Coding (LCC) based sampling method to improve GANs. We derive a generalization bound for LCC based GANs and prove that a small dimensional input is sufficient to achieve good generalization. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
### 243.Convolutional Sparse Coding for High Dynamic Range Imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04942.pdf)
> Current HDR acquisition techniques are based on either (i) fusing multibracketed, low dynamic range (LDR) images, (ii) modifying existing hardware and capturing different exposures simultaneously with multiple sensors, or (iii) reconstructing a single image with spatially-varying pixel exposures. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to recover high-quality HDRI images from a single, coded exposure. The proposed reconstruction method builds on recently-introduced ideas of convolutional sparse coding (CSC); this paper demonstrates how to make CSC practical for HDR imaging. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher-quality reconstructions than alternative methods, we evaluate optical coding schemes, analyze algorithmic parameters, and build a prototype coded HDR camera that demonstrates the utility of convolutional sparse HDRI coding with a custom hardware platform. 
### 244.Higher Order of Motion Magnification for Vessel Localisation in Surgical  Video [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04955.pdf)
> Locating vessels during surgery is critical for avoiding inadvertent damage, yet vasculature can be difficult to identify. Video motion magnification can potentially highlight vessels by exaggerating subtle motion embedded within the video to become perceivable to the surgeon. In this paper, we explore a physiological model of artery distension to extend motion magnification to incorporate higher orders of motion, leveraging the difference in acceleration over time (jerk) in pulsatile motion to highlight the vascular pulse wave. Our method is compared to first and second order motion based Eulerian video magnification algorithms. Using data from a surgical video retrieved during a robotic prostatectomy, we show that our method can accentuate cardio-physiological features and produce a more succinct and clearer video for motion magnification, with more similarities in areas without motion to the source video at large magnifications. We validate the approach with a Structure Similarity (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) assessment of three videos at an increasing working distance, using three different levels of optical magnification. Spatio-temporal cross sections are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposal and video samples are provided to demonstrates qualitatively our results. 
### 245.Expression Empowered ResiDen Network for Facial Action Unit Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04957.pdf)
> The paper explores the topic of Facial Action Unit (FAU) detection in the wild. In particular, we are interested in answering the following questions: (1) how useful are residual connections across dense blocks for face analysis? (2) how useful is the information from a network trained for categorical Facial Expression Recognition (FER) for the task of FAU detection? The proposed network (ResiDen) exploits dense blocks along with residual connections and uses auxiliary information from a FER network. The experiments are performed on the EmotionNet and DISFA datasets. The experiments show the usefulness of facial expression information for AU detection. The proposed network achieves state-of-art results on the two databases. Analysis of the results for cross database protocol shows the effectiveness of the network. 
### 246.Unsupervised Detection of Lesions in Brain MRI using constrained  adversarial auto-encoders [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04972.pdf)
> Lesion detection in brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) remains a challenging task. State-of-the-art approaches are mostly based on supervised learning making use of large annotated datasets. Human beings, on the other hand, even non-experts, can detect most abnormal lesions after seeing a handful of healthy brain images. Replicating this capability of using prior information on the appearance of healthy brain structure to detect lesions can help computers achieve human level abnormality detection, specifically reducing the need for numerous labeled examples and bettering generalization of previously unseen lesions. To this end, we study detection of lesion regions in an unsupervised manner by learning data distribution of brain MRI of healthy subjects using auto-encoder based methods. We hypothesize that one of the main limitations of the current models is the lack of consistency in latent representation. We propose a simple yet effective constraint that helps mapping of an image bearing lesion close to its corresponding healthy image in the latent space. We use the Human Connectome Project dataset to learn distribution of healthy-appearing brain MRI and report improved detection, in terms of AUC, of the lesions in the BRATS challenge dataset. 
### 247.Self-Supervised Feature Learning by Learning to Spot Artifacts [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05024.pdf)
> We introduce a novel self-supervised learning method based on adversarial training. Our objective is to train a discriminator network to distinguish real images from images with synthetic artifacts, and then to extract features from its intermediate layers that can be transferred to other data domains and tasks. To generate images with artifacts, we pre-train a high-capacity autoencoder and then we use a damage and repair strategy: First, we freeze the autoencoder and damage the output of the encoder by randomly dropping its entries. Second, we augment the decoder with a repair network, and train it in an adversarial manner against the discriminator. The repair network helps generate more realistic images by inpainting the dropped feature entries. To make the discriminator focus on the artifacts, we also make it predict what entries in the feature were dropped. We demonstrate experimentally that features learned by creating and spotting artifacts achieve state of the art performance in several benchmarks. 
### 248.A Probabilistic U-Net for Segmentation of Ambiguous Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05034.pdf)
> Many real-world vision problems suffer from inherent ambiguities. In clinical applications for example, it might not be clear from a CT scan alone which particular region is cancer tissue. Therefore a group of graders typically produces a set of diverse but plausible segmentations. We consider the task of learning a distribution over segmentations given an input. To this end we propose a generative segmentation model based on a combination of a U-Net with a conditional variational autoencoder that is capable of efficiently producing an unlimited number of plausible hypotheses. We show on a lung abnormalities segmentation task and on a Cityscapes segmentation task that our model reproduces the possible segmentation variants as well as the frequencies with which they occur, doing so significantly better than published approaches. These models could have a high impact in real-world applications, such as being used as clinical decision-making algorithms accounting for multiple plausible semantic segmentation hypotheses to provide possible diagnoses and recommend further actions to resolve the present ambiguities. 
### 249.Multiple Instance Learning for Heterogeneous Images: Training a CNN for  Histopathology [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05083.pdf)
> Multiple instance (MI) learning with a convolutional neural network enables end-to-end training in the presence of weak image-level labels. We propose a new method for aggregating predictions from smaller regions of the image into an image-level classification by using the quantile function. The quantile function provides a more complete description of the heterogeneity within each image, improving image-level classification. We also adapt image augmentation to the MI framework by randomly selecting cropped regions on which to apply MI aggregation during each epoch of training. This provides a mechanism to study the importance of MI learning. We validate our method on five different classification tasks for breast tumor histology and provide a visualization method for interpreting local image classifications that could lead to future insights into tumor heterogeneity. 
### 250.Group Equivariant Capsule Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05086.pdf)
> We present group equivariant capsule networks, a framework to introduce guaranteed equivariance and invariance properties to the capsule network idea. We restrict pose vectors and learned transformations to be elements of a group, which allows us to prove equivariance of pose vectors and invariance of activations under application of the group law. Requirements are a modified spatial aggregation method for capsules and a generic routing by agreement algorithm with abstract rules, which we both present in this work. Further, we connect our equivariant capsule networks with work from the field of group convolutional networks, which consist of convolutions that are equivariant under applications of the group law. Through this connection, we are able to provide intuitions of how both methods relate and are able to combine both approaches in one deep neural network architecture, combining the strengths from both fields. The resulting framework allows sparse evaluation of feature maps defined over groups, provides control over specific equivariance and invariance properties and can use routing by agreement instead of pooling operations. It provides interpretable and equivariant representation vectors as output capsules, which disentangle evidence of object existence from its pose. 
### 251.Estimating Achilles tendon healing progress with convolutional neural  networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05091.pdf)
> Quantitative assessment of a treatment progress in the Achilles tendon healing process - one of the most common musculoskeletal disorder in modern medical practice - is typically a long and complex process: multiple MRI protocols need to be acquired and analysed by radiology experts. In this paper, we propose to significantly reduce the complexity of this assessment using a novel method based on a pre-trained convolutional neural network. We first train our neural network on over 500,000 2D axial cross-sections from over 3000 3D MRI studies to classify MRI images as belonging to a healthy or injured class, depending on the patient's condition. We then take the outputs of modified pre-trained network and apply linear regression on the PCA-reduced space of the features to assess treatment progress. Our method allows to reduce up to 5-fold the amount of data needed to be registered during the MRI scan without any information loss. Furthermore, we are able to predict the healing process phase with equal accuracy to human experts in 3 out of 6 main criteria. Finally, contrary to the current approaches to regeneration assessment that rely on radiologist subjective opinion, our method allows to objectively compare different treatments methods which can lead to improved diagnostics and patient's recovery. 
### 252.Improving Cytoarchitectonic Segmentation of Human Brain Areas with  Self-supervised Siamese Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05104.pdf)
> Cytoarchitectonic parcellations of the human brain serve as anatomical references in multimodal atlas frameworks. They are based on analysis of cell-body stained histological sections and the identification of borders between brain areas. The de-facto standard involves a semi-automatic, reproducible border detection, but does not scale with high-throughput imaging in large series of sections at microscopical resolution. Automatic parcellation, however, is extremely challenging due to high variation in the data, and the need for a large field of view at microscopic resolution. The performance of a recently proposed Convolutional Neural Network model that addresses this problem especially suffers from the naturally limited amount of expert annotations for training. To circumvent this limitation, we propose to pre-train neural networks on a self-supervised auxiliary task, predicting the 3D distance between two patches sampled from the same brain. Compared to a random initialization, fine-tuning from these networks results in significantly better segmentations. We show that the self-supervised model has implicitly learned to distinguish several cortical brain areas -- a strong indicator that the proposed auxiliary task is appropriate for cytoarchitectonic mapping. 
### 253.What Is It Like Down There? Generating Dense Ground-Level Views and  Image Features From Overhead Imagery Using Conditional Generative Adversarial  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05129.pdf)
> This paper investigates conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to overcome a fundamental limitation of using geotagged media for geographic discovery, namely its sparse and uneven spatial distribution. We train a cGAN to generate ground-level views of a location given overhead imagery. We show the "fake" ground-level images are natural looking and are structurally similar to the real images. More significantly, we show the generated images are representative of the locations and that the representations learned by the cGANs are informative. In particular, we show that dense feature maps generated using our framework are more effective for land-cover classification than approaches which spatially interpolate features extracted from sparse ground-level images. To our knowledge, ours is the first work to use cGANs to generate ground-level views given overhead imagery and to explore the benefits of the learned representations. 
### 254.Cross-modal Hallucination for Few-shot Fine-grained Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05147.pdf)
> State-of-the-art deep learning algorithms generally require large amounts of data for model training. Lack thereof can severely deteriorate the performance, particularly in scenarios with fine-grained boundaries between categories. To this end, we propose a multimodal approach that facilitates bridging the information gap by means of meaningful joint embeddings. Specifically, we present a benchmark that is multimodal during training (i.e. images and texts) and single-modal in testing time (i.e. images), with the associated task to utilize multimodal data in base classes (with many samples), to learn explicit visual classifiers for novel classes (with few samples). Next, we propose a framework built upon the idea of cross-modal data hallucination. In this regard, we introduce a discriminative text-conditional GAN for sample generation with a simple self-paced strategy for sample selection. We show the results of our proposed discriminative hallucinated method for 1-, 2-, and 5- shot learning on the CUB dataset, where the accuracy is improved by employing multimodal data. 
### 255.Automated Performance Assessment in Transoesophageal Echocardiography  with Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05154.pdf)
> Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a valuable diagnostic and monitoring imaging modality. Proper image acquisition is essential for diagnosis, yet current assessment techniques are solely based on manual expert review. This paper presents a supervised deep learn ing framework for automatically evaluating and grading the quality of TEE images. To obtain the necessary dataset, 38 participants of varied experience performed TEE exams with a high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) platform. Two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, AlexNet and VGG, structured to perform regression, were finetuned and validated on manually graded images from three evaluators. Two different scoring strategies, a criteria-based percentage and an overall general impression, were used. The developed CNN models estimate the average score with a root mean square accuracy ranging between 84%-93%, indicating the ability to replicate expert valuation. Proposed strategies for automated TEE assessment can have a significant impact on the training process of new TEE operators, providing direct feedback and facilitating the development of the necessary dexterous skills. 
### 256.A Unified Framework for Generalizable Style Transfer: Style and Content  Separation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05173.pdf)
> Image style transfer has drawn broad attention in recent years. However, most existing methods aim to explicitly model the transformation between different styles, and the learned model is thus not generalizable to new styles. We here propose a unified style transfer framework for both character typeface transfer and neural style transfer tasks leveraging style and content separation. A key merit of such framework is its generalizability to new styles and contents. The overall framework consists of style encoder, content encoder, mixer and decoder. The style encoder and content encoder are used to extract the style and content representations from the corresponding reference images. The mixer integrates the above two representations and feeds it into the decoder to generate images with the target style and content. During training, the encoder networks learn to extract styles and contents from limited size of style/content reference images. This learning framework allows simultaneous style transfer among multiple styles and can be deemed as a special `multi-task' learning scenario. The encoders are expected to capture the underlying features for different styles and contents which is generalizable to new styles and contents. Under this framework, we design two individual networks for character typeface transfer and neural style transfer, respectively. For character typeface transfer, to separate the style features and content features, we leverage the conditional dependence of styles and contents given an image. For neural style transfer, we leverage the statistical information of feature maps in certain layers to represent style. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods. 
### 257.Fully Convolutional Network for Automatic Road Extraction from Satellite  Imagery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05182.pdf)
> Analysis of high-resolution satellite images has been an important research topic for traffic management, city planning, and road monitoring. One of the problems here is automatic and precise road extraction. From an original image, it is difficult and computationally expensive to extract roads due to presences of other road-like features with straight edges. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic road extraction based on a fully convolutional neural network of U-net family. This network consists of ResNet-34 pre-trained on ImageNet and decoder adapted from vanilla U-Net. Based on validation results, leaderboard and our own experience this network shows superior results for the DEEPGLOBE - CVPR 2018 road extraction sub-challenge. Moreover, this network uses moderate memory that allows using just one GTX 1080 or 1080ti video cards to perform whole training and makes pretty fast predictions. 
### 258.Automatic counting of fission tracks in apatite and muscovite using  image processing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05199.pdf)
> One of the major difficulties of automatic track counting using photomicrographs is separating overlapped tracks. We address this issue combining image processing algorithms such as skeletonization, and we test our algorithm with several binarization techniques. The counting algorithm was successfully applied to determine the efficiency factor GQR, necessary for standardless fission-track dating, involving counting induced tracks in apatite and muscovite with superficial densities of about $6 \times 10^5$ tracks/$cm^2$. 
### 259.Impostor Networks for Fast Fine-Grained Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05217.pdf)
> In this work we introduce impostor networks, an architecture that allows to perform fine-grained recognition with high accuracy and using a light-weight convolutional network, making it particularly suitable for fine-grained applications on low-power and non-GPU enabled platforms. Impostor networks compensate for the lightness of its `backend' network by combining it with a lightweight non-parametric classifier. The combination of a convolutional network and such non-parametric classifier is trained in an end-to-end fashion. Similarly to convolutional neural networks, impostor networks can fit large-scale training datasets very well, while also being able to generalize to new data points. At the same time, the bulk of computations within impostor networks happen through nearest neighbor search in high-dimensions. Such search can be performed efficiently on a variety of architectures including standard CPUs, where deep convolutional networks are inefficient. In a series of experiments with three fine-grained datasets, we show that impostor networks are able to boost the classification accuracy of a moderate-sized convolutional network considerably at a very small computational cost. 
### 260.Human Activity Recognition Based on Wearable Sensor Data: A  Standardization of the State-of-the-Art [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05226.pdf)
> Human activity recognition based on wearable sensor data has been an attractive research topic due to its application in areas such as healthcare, homeland security and smart environments. In this context, many works have presented remarkable results using accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data to represent the categories of activities. However, the current studies do not consider important issues that lead to skewed results, making hard to measure how well sensor-based human activity recognition is and preventing a direct comparison of previous works. These issues include the employed metrics, the validation protocol used, the samples generation process, and the quality of the dataset (i.e., the sampling rate and the number of activities to be recognized). We emphasize that in other research areas, such as image classification and object detection, these issues are well-defined, which brings more efforts towards the application. Inspired by this, in this work, we conduct an extensive set of experiments to indicate the vulnerable points in human activity recognition based on wearable sensor data. To this purpose, we implement and evaluate several state-of-the-art approaches, ranging from handcrafted-based methods to convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, we standardize a large number of datasets, which vary in terms of sampling rate, number of sensors, activities and subjects. According to our study, the most of evaluation types applied in the literature are not adequate to perform the activity recognition in the context of wearable sensor data, in which the recognition accuracy drops around ten percentage points when compared to the appropriate validation. 
### 261.3D-CODED : 3D Correspondences by Deep Deformation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05228.pdf)
> We present a new deep learning approach for matching deformable shapes by introducing {\it Shape Deformation Networks} which jointly encode 3D shapes and correspondences. This is achieved by factoring the surface representation into (i) a template, that parameterizes the surface, and (ii) a learnt global feature vector that parameterizes the transformation of the template into the input surface. By predicting this feature for a new shape, we implicitly predict correspondences between this shape and the template. We show that these correspondences can be improved by an additional step which improves the shape feature by minimizing the Chamfer distance between the input and transformed template. We demonstrate that our simple approach improves on state-of-the-art results on the difficult FAUST-inter challenge, with an average correspondence error of 2.88cm. We show, on the TOSCA dataset, that our method is robust to many types of perturbations, and generalizes to non-human shapes. This robustness allows it to perform well on real unclean, meshes from the the SCAPE dataset. 
### 262.Identifying Recurring Patterns with Deep Neural Networks for Natural  Image Denoising [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05229.pdf)
> While there is a vast diversity in the patterns and textures that occur across different varieties of natural images, the variance of such patterns within a single image is far more limited. A variety of traditional methods have exploited this self-similarity or recurrence with considerable success for image modeling, estimation, and restoration. A key challenge, however, is in accurately identifying recurring patterns within degraded image observations. This work proposes a new method for natural image denoising, that trains a deep neural network to determine whether noisy patches share common underlying patterns. Specifically, given a pair of noisy patches, the network predicts whether different transform sub-band coefficients of the original noise-free patches are the same. The denoising algorithm averages these matched coefficients to obtain an initial estimate of the clean image, with much higher quality than traditional approaches. This estimate is then refined with a second post-processing network, yielding state-of-the-art denoising performance. 
### 263.End-to-End Parkinson Disease Diagnosis using Brain MR-Images by 3D-CNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05233.pdf)
> In this work, we use a deep learning framework for simultaneous classification and regression of Parkinson disease diagnosis based on MR-Images and personal information (i.e. age, gender). We intend to facilitate and increase the confidence in Parkinson disease diagnosis through our deep learning framework. 
### 264.Weighted Tanimoto Coefficient for 3D Molecule Structure Similarity  Measurement [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05237.pdf)
> Similarity searching of molecular structure has been an important application in the Chemoinformatics, especially in drug discovery. Similarity searching is a common method used for identification of molecular structure. It involve three main principal component of similarity searching: structure representation; weighting scheme; and similarity coefficient. In this paper, we introduces Weighted Tanimoto Coefficient based on weighted Euclidean distance in order to investigate the effect of weight function on the result for similarity searching. The Tanimoto coefficient is one of the popular similarity coefficients used to measure the similarity between pairs of the molecule. The most of research area found that the similarity searching is based on binary or fingerprint data. Meanwhile, we used non-binary data and was set amphetamine structure as a reference or targeted structure and the rest of the dataset becomes a database structure. Throughout this study, it showed that there is definitely gives a different result between a similarity searching with and without weight. 
### 265.Finding your Lookalike: Measuring Face Similarity Rather than Face  Identity [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05252.pdf)
> Face images are one of the main areas of focus for computer vision, receiving on a wide variety of tasks. Although face recognition is probably the most widely researched, many other tasks such as kinship detection, facial expression classification and facial aging have been examined. In this work we propose the new, subjective task of quantifying perceived face similarity between a pair of faces. That is, we predict the perceived similarity between facial images, given that they are not of the same person. Although this task is clearly correlated with face recognition, it is different and therefore justifies a separate investigation. Humans often remark that two persons look alike, even in cases where the persons are not actually confused with one another. In addition, because face similarity is different than traditional image similarity, there are challenges in data collection and labeling, and dealing with diverging subjective opinions between human labelers. We present evidence that finding facial look-alikes and recognizing faces are two distinct tasks. We propose a new dataset for facial similarity and introduce the Lookalike network, directed towards similar face classification, which outperforms the ad hoc usage of a face recognition network directed at the same task. 
### 266.A Flexible Convolutional Solver with Application to Photorealistic Style  Transfer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05285.pdf)
> We propose a new flexible deep convolutional neural network (convnet) to perform fast visual style transfer. In contrast to existing convnets that address the same task, our architecture derives directly from the structure of the gradient descent originally used to solve the style transfer problem [Gatys et al., 2016]. Like existing convnets, ours approximately solves the original problem much faster than the gradient descent. However, our network is uniquely flexible by design: it can be manipulated at runtime to enforce new constraints on the final solution. In particular, we show how to modify it to obtain a photorealistic result with no retraining. We study the modifications made by [Luan et al., 2017] to the original cost function of [Gatys et al., 2016] to achieve photorealistic style transfer. These modifications affect directly the gradient descent and can be reported on-the-fly in our network. These modifications are possible as the proposed architecture stems from unrolling the gradient descent. 
### 267.Shape Features Extraction Using a Partial Differential Equation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05299.pdf)
> This paper presents a unified method for extraction of geometrical shape features in binary image data using a linear partial differential equation (PDE). The PDE and functions are formulated to extract geometrical shape features, which are thickness, shape orientation and skeleton, all at once. The main advantages of the proposed method are it is free of any computation with respect to distance, it has no topological constraint of target image data and surfaces do not have to be distinguished to inside or outside. A one dimensional analytical solution is provided to validate the proposed method. Additionally, two- and three-dimensional numerical examples are shown to confirm the validity and usefulness of the proposed method. 
### 268.SCSP: Spectral Clustering Filter Pruning with Soft Self-adaption Manners [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05320.pdf)
> Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has achieved significant success in computer vision field. However, the high computational cost of the deep complex models prevents the deployment on edge devices with limited memory and computational resource. In this paper, we proposed a novel filter pruning for convolutional neural networks compression, namely spectral clustering filter pruning with soft self-adaption manners (SCSP). We first apply spectral clustering on filters layer by layer to explore their intrinsic connections and only count on efficient groups. By self-adaption manners, the pruning operations can be done in few epochs to let the network gradually choose meaningful groups. According to this strategy, we not only achieve model compression while keeping considerable performance, but also find a novel angle to interpret the model compression process. 
### 269.From Trailers to Storylines: An Efficient Way to Learn from Movies [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05341.pdf)
> The millions of movies produced in the human history are valuable resources for computer vision research. However, learning a vision model from movie data would meet with serious difficulties. A major obstacle is the computational cost -- the length of a movie is often over one hour, which is substantially longer than the short video clips that previous study mostly focuses on. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to learning vision models from movies. Specifically, we consider a framework comprised of a visual module and a temporal analysis module. Unlike conventional learning methods, the proposed approach learns these modules from different sets of data -- the former from trailers while the latter from movies. This allows distinctive visual features to be learned within a reasonable budget while still preserving long-term temporal structures across an entire movie. We construct a large-scale dataset for this study and define a series of tasks on top. Experiments on this dataset showed that the proposed method can substantially reduce the training time while obtaining highly effective features and coherent temporal structures. 
### 270.Convex Class Model on Symmetric Positive Definite Manifolds [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05343.pdf)
> The effectiveness of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold features has been proven in various computer vision tasks. However, due to the non-Euclidean geometry of these features, existing Euclidean machineries cannot be directly used. In this paper, we tackle the classification tasks with limited training data on SPD manifolds. Our proposed framework, named Manifold Convex Class Model, represents each class on SPD manifolds using a convex model and classification can be performed by computing distances to the convex models. We provide three methods based on different metrics to address the optimization problem of the smallest distance of a point to the convex model on SPD manifold. The efficacy of our proposed framework is demonstrated both on synthetic data and several computer vision tasks including object recognition, texture classification, person re-identification and traffic scene classification. 
### 271.View-volume Network for Semantic Scene Completion from a Single Depth  Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05361.pdf)
> We introduce a View-Volume convolutional neural network (VVNet) for inferring the occupancy and semantic labels of a volumetric 3D scene from a single depth image. The VVNet concatenates a 2D view CNN and a 3D volume CNN with a differentiable projection layer. Given a single RGBD image, our method extracts the detailed geometric features from the input depth image with a 2D view CNN and then projects the features into a 3D volume according to the input depth map via a projection layer. After that, we learn the 3D context information of the scene with a 3D volume CNN for computing the result volumetric occupancy and semantic labels. With combined 2D and 3D representations, the VVNet efficiently reduces the computational cost, enables feature extraction from multi-channel high resolution inputs, and thus significantly improves the result accuracy. We validate our method and demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness on both synthetic SUNCG and real NYU dataset. 
### 272.Fire SSD: Wide Fire Modules based Single Shot Detector on Edge Device [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05363.pdf)
> With the emergence of edge computing, there is an increasing need for running convolutional neural network based object detection on small form factor edge computing devices with limited compute and thermal budget for applications such as video surveillance. To address this problem, efficient object detection frameworks such as YOLO and SSD were proposed. However, SSD based object detection that uses VGG16 as backend network is insufficient to achieve real time speed on edge devices. To further improve the detection speed, the backend network is replaced by more efficient networks such as SqueezeNet and MobileNet. Although the speed is greatly improved, it comes with a price of lower accuracy. In this paper, we propose an efficient SSD named Fire SSD. Fire SSD achieves 70.7mAP on Pascal VOC 2007 test set. Fire SSD achieves the speed of 30.6FPS on low power mainstream CPU and is about 6 times faster than SSD300 and has about 4 times smaller model size. Fire SSD also achieves 22.2FPS on integrated GPU. 
### 273.Multi-Attention Multi-Class Constraint for Fine-grained Image  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05372.pdf)
> Attention-based learning for fine-grained image recognition remains a challenging task, where most of the existing methods treat each object part in isolation, while neglecting the correlations among them. In addition, the multi-stage or multi-scale mechanisms involved make the existing methods less efficient and hard to be trained end-to-end. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) which regulates multiple object parts among different input images. Our method first learns multiple attention region features of each input image through the one-squeeze multi-excitation (OSME) module, and then apply the multi-attention multi-class constraint (MAMC) in a metric learning framework. For each anchor feature, the MAMC functions by pulling same-attention same-class features closer, while pushing different-attention or different-class features away. Our method can be easily trained end-to-end, and is highly efficient which requires only one training stage. Moreover, we introduce Dogs-in-the-Wild, a comprehensive dog species dataset that surpasses similar existing datasets by category coverage, data volume and annotation quality. This dataset will be released upon acceptance to facilitate the research of fine-grained image recognition. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the substantial improvements of our method on four benchmark datasets. 
### 274.Single Image Reflection Separation with Perceptual Losses [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05376.pdf)
> We present an approach to separating reflection from a single image. The approach uses a fully convolutional network trained end-to-end with losses that exploit low-level and high-level image information. Our loss function includes two perceptual losses: a feature loss from a visual perception network, and an adversarial loss that encodes characteristics of images in the transmission layers. We also propose a novel exclusion loss that enforces pixel-level layer separation. We create a dataset of real-world images with reflection and corresponding ground-truth transmission layers for quantitative evaluation and model training. We validate our method through comprehensive quantitative experiments and show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art reflection removal methods in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual user study. We also extend our method to two other image enhancement tasks to demonstrate the generality of our approach. 
### 275.Deep Generative Models in the Real-World: An Open Challenge from Medical  Imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05452.pdf)
> Recent advances in deep learning led to novel generative modeling techniques that achieve unprecedented quality in generated samples and performance in learning complex distributions in imaging data. These new models in medical image computing have important applications that form clinically relevant and very challenging unsupervised learning problems. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using state-of-the-art auto-encoder-based deep generative models, such as variational and adversarial auto-encoders, for one such task: abnormality detection in medical imaging. We utilize typical, publicly available datasets with brain scans from healthy subjects and patients with stroke lesions and brain tumors. We use the data from healthy subjects to train different auto-encoder based models to learn the distribution of healthy images and detect pathologies as outliers. Models that can better learn the data distribution should be able to detect outliers more accurately. We evaluate the detection performance of deep generative models and compare them with non-deep learning based approaches to provide a benchmark of the current state of research. We conclude that abnormality detection is a challenging task for deep generative models and large room exists for improvement. In order to facilitate further research, we aim to provide carefully pre-processed imaging data available to the research community. 
### 276.Analysis of the Effect of Unexpected Outliers in the Classification of  Spectroscopy Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05455.pdf)
> Multi-class classification algorithms are very widely used, but we argue that they are not always ideal from a theoretical perspective, because they assume all classes are characterized by the data, whereas in many applications, training data for some classes may be entirely absent, rare, or statistically unrepresentative. We evaluate one-sided classifiers as an alternative, since they assume that only one class (the target) is well characterized. We consider a task of identifying whether a substance contains a chlorinated solvent, based on its chemical spectrum. For this application, it is not really feasible to collect a statistically representative set of outliers, since that group may contain \emph{anything} apart from the target chlorinated solvents. Using a new one-sided classification toolkit, we compare a One-Sided k-NN algorithm with two well-known binary classification algorithms, and conclude that the one-sided classifier is more robust to unexpected outliers. 
### 277.Efficient Active Learning for Image Classification and Segmentation  using a Sample Selection and Conditional Generative Adversarial Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05473.pdf)
> Training robust deep learning (DL) systems for medical image classification or segmentation is challenging due to limited images covering different disease types and severity. We propose an active learning (AL) framework to select most informative samples and add to the training data. We use conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to generate realistic chest xray images with different disease characteristics by conditioning its generation on a real image sample. Informative samples to add to the training set are identified using a Bayesian neural network. Experiments show our proposed AL framework is able to achieve state of the art performance by using about 35% of the full dataset, thus saving significant time and effort over conventional methods. 
### 278.Copycat CNN: Stealing Knowledge by Persuading Confession with Random  Non-Labeled Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05476.pdf)
> In the past few years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of problems. Many companies employ resources and money to generate these models and provide them as an API, therefore it is in their best interest to protect them, i.e., to avoid that someone else copies them. Recent studies revealed that state-of-the-art CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples attacks, and this weakness indicates that CNNs do not need to operate in the problem domain (PD). Therefore, we hypothesize that they also do not need to be trained with examples of the PD in order to operate in it. <br />Given these facts, in this paper, we investigate if a target black-box CNN can be copied by persuading it to confess its knowledge through random non-labeled data. The copy is two-fold: i) the target network is queried with random data and its predictions are used to create a fake dataset with the knowledge of the network; and ii) a copycat network is trained with the fake dataset and should be able to achieve similar performance as the target network. <br />This hypothesis was evaluated locally in three problems (facial expression, object, and crosswalk classification) and against a cloud-based API. In the copy attacks, images from both non-problem domain and PD were used. All copycat networks achieved at least 93.7% of the performance of the original models with non-problem domain data, and at least 98.6% using additional data from the PD. Additionally, the copycat CNN successfully copied at least 97.3% of the performance of the Microsoft Azure Emotion API. Our results show that it is possible to create a copycat CNN by simply querying a target network as black-box with random non-labeled data. 
### 279.Dense Light Field Reconstruction From Sparse Sampling Using Residual  Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05506.pdf)
> A light field records numerous light rays from a real-world scene. However, capturing a dense light field by existing devices is a time-consuming process. Besides, reconstructing a large amount of light rays equivalent to multiple light fields using sparse sampling arises a severe challenge for existing methods. In this paper, we present a learning based method to reconstruct multiple novel light fields between two mutually independent light fields. We indicate that light rays distributed in different light fields have the same consistent constraints under a certain condition. The most significant constraint is a depth related correlation between angular and spatial dimensions. Our method avoids working out the error-sensitive constraint by employing a deep neural network. We solve residual values of pixels on epipolar plane image (EPI) to reconstruct novel light fields. Our method is able to reconstruct 2 to 4 novel light fields between two mutually independent input light fields. We also compare our results with those yielded by a number of alternatives elsewhere in the literature, which shows our reconstructed light fields have better structure similarity and occlusion relationship. 
### 280.ReConvNet: Video Object Segmentation with Spatio-Temporal Features  Modulation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05510.pdf)
> We introduce ReConvNet, a recurrent convolutional architecture for semi-supervised video object segmentation that is able to fast adapt its features to focus on any specific object of interest at inference time. Generalization to new objects never observed during training is known to be a hard task for supervised approaches that would need to be retrained. To tackle this problem, we propose a more efficient solution that learns spatio-temporal features self-adapting to the object of interest via conditional affine transformations. This approach is simple, can be trained end-to-end and does not necessarily require extra training steps at inference time. Our method shows competitive results on DAVIS2016 with respect to state-of-the art approaches that use online fine-tuning, and outperforms them on DAVIS2017. ReConvNet shows also promising results on the DAVIS-Challenge 2018 winning the $10$-th position. 
### 281.NetScore: Towards Universal Metrics for Large-scale Performance Analysis  of Deep Neural Networks for Practical On-Device Edge Usage [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05512.pdf)
> Much of the focus in the design of deep neural networks has been on improving accuracy, leading to more powerful yet highly complex network architectures that are difficult to deploy in practical scenarios, particularly on edge devices such as mobile and other consumer devices given their high computational and memory requirements. As a result, there has been a recent interest in the design of quantitative metrics for evaluating deep neural networks that accounts for more than just model accuracy as the sole indicator of network performance. In this study, we continue the conversation towards universal metrics for evaluating the performance of deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage. In particular, we propose a new balanced metric called NetScore, which is designed specifically to provide a quantitative assessment of the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity of a deep neural network, which is important for on-device edge operation. In what is one of the largest comparative analysis between deep neural networks in literature, the NetScore metric, the top-1 accuracy metric, and the popular information density metric were compared across a diverse set of 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC 2012) dataset. The evaluation results across these three metrics for this diverse set of networks are presented in this study to act as a reference guide for practitioners in the field. The proposed NetScore metric, along with the other tested metrics, are by no means perfect, but the hope is to push the conversation towards better universal metrics for evaluating deep neural networks for use in practical on-device edge scenarios to help guide practitioners in model design for such scenarios. 
### 282.EL-GAN: Embedding Loss Driven Generative Adversarial Networks for Lane  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05525.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to semantic segmentation problems. However, there are many problems that are inherently not pixel-wise classification problems but are nevertheless frequently formulated as semantic segmentation. This ill-posed formulation consequently necessitates hand-crafted scenario-specific and computationally expensive post-processing methods to convert the per pixel probability maps to final desired outputs. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to make the semantic segmentation network output to be more realistic or better structure-preserving, decreasing the dependency on potentially complex post-processing. In this work, we propose EL-GAN: a GAN framework to mitigate the discussed problem using an embedding loss. With EL-GAN, we discriminate based on learned embeddings of both the labels and the prediction at the same time. This results in more stable training due to having better discriminative information, benefiting from seeing both `fake' and `real' predictions at the same time. This substantially stabilizes the adversarial training process. We use the TuSimple lane marking challenge to demonstrate that with our proposed framework it is viable to overcome the inherent anomalies of posing it as a semantic segmentation problem. Not only is the output considerably more similar to the labels when compared to conventional methods, the subsequent post-processing is also simpler and crosses the competitive 96% accuracy threshold. 
### 283.Correlation Tracking via Robust Region Proposals [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05530.pdf)
> Recently, correlation filter-based trackers have received extensive attention due to their simplicity and superior speed. However, such trackers perform poorly when the target undergoes occlusion, viewpoint change or other challenging attributes due to pre-defined sampling strategy. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose an adaptive region proposal scheme to facilitate visual tracking. To be more specific, a novel tracking monitoring indicator is advocated to forecast tracking failure. Afterwards, we incorporate detection and scale proposals respectively, to recover from model drift as well as handle aspect ratio variation. We test the proposed algorithm on several challenging sequences, which have demonstrated that the proposed tracker performs favourably against state-of-the-art trackers. 
### 284.Cardiac Motion Scoring with Segment- and Subject-level Non-Local  Modeling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05569.pdf)
> Motion scoring of cardiac myocardium is of paramount importance for early detection and diagnosis of various cardiac disease. It aims at identifying regional wall motions into one of the four types including normal, hypokinetic, akinetic, and dyskinetic, and is extremely challenging due to the complex myocardium deformation and subtle inter-class difference of motion patterns. All existing work on automated motion analysis are focused on binary abnormality detection to avoid the much more demanding motion scoring, which is urgently required in real clinical practice yet has never been investigated before. In this work, we propose Cardiac-MOS, the first powerful method for cardiac motion scoring from cardiac MR sequences based on deep convolution neural network. Due to the locality of convolution, the relationship between distant non-local responses of the feature map cannot be explored, which is closely related to motion difference between segments. In Cardiac-MOS, such non-local relationship is modeled with non-local neural network within each segment and across all segments of one subject, i.e., segment- and subject-level non-local modeling, and lead to obvious performance improvement. Besides, Cardiac-MOS can effectively extract motion information from MR sequences of various lengths by interpolating the convolution kernel along the temporal dimension, therefore can be applied to MR sequences of multiple sources. Experiments on 1440 myocardium segments of 90 subjects from short axis MR sequences of multiple lengths prove that Cardiac-MOS achieves reliable performance, with correlation of 0.926 for motion score index estimation and accuracy of 77.4\% for motion scoring. Cardiac-MOS also outperforms all existing work for binary abnormality detection. As the first automatic motion scoring solution, Cardiac-MOS demonstrates great potential in future clinical application. 
### 285.Direct Automated Quantitative Measurement of Spine via Cascade Amplifier  Regression Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05570.pdf)
> Automated quantitative measurement of the spine (i.e., multiple indices estimation of heights, widths, areas, and so on for the vertebral body and disc) is of the utmost importance in clinical spinal disease diagnoses, such as osteoporosis, intervertebral disc degeneration, and lumbar disc herniation, yet still an unprecedented challenge due to the variety of spine structure and the high dimensionality of indices to be estimated. In this paper, we propose a novel cascade amplifier regression network (CARN), which includes the CARN architecture and local shape-constrained manifold regularization (LSCMR) loss function, to achieve accurate direct automated multiple indices estimation. The CARN architecture is composed of a cascade amplifier network (CAN) for expressive feature embedding and a linear regression model for multiple indices estimation. The CAN consists of cascade amplifier units (AUs), which are used for selective feature reuse by stimulating effective feature and suppressing redundant feature during propagating feature map between adjacent layers, thus an expressive feature embedding is obtained. During training, the LSCMR is utilized to alleviate overfitting and generate realistic estimation by learning the multiple indices distribution. Experiments on MR images of 195 subjects show that the proposed CARN achieves impressive performance with mean absolute errors of 1.2496 mm, 1.2887 mm, and 1.2692 mm for estimation of 15 heights of discs, 15 heights of vertebral bodies, and total indices respectively. The proposed method has great potential in clinical spinal disease diagnoses. 
### 286.Weakly-Supervised Learning for Tool Localization in Laparoscopic Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05573.pdf)
> Surgical tool localization is an essential task for the automatic analysis of endoscopic videos. In the literature, existing methods for tool localization, tracking and segmentation require training data that is fully annotated, thereby limiting the size of the datasets that can be used and the generalization of the approaches. In this work, we propose to circumvent the lack of annotated data with weak supervision. We propose a deep architecture, trained solely on image level annotations, that can be used for both tool presence detection and localization in surgical videos. Our architecture relies on a fully convolutional neural network, trained end-to-end, enabling us to localize surgical tools without explicit spatial annotations. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on a large public dataset, Cholec80, which is fully annotated with binary tool presence information and of which 5 videos have been fully annotated with bounding boxes and tool centers for the evaluation. 
### 287.Tract orientation mapping for bundle-specific tractography [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05580.pdf)
> While the major white matter tracts are of great interest to numerous studies in neuroscience and medicine, their manual dissection in larger cohorts from diffusion MRI tractograms is time-consuming, requires expert knowledge and is hard to reproduce. Tract orientation mapping (TOM) is a novel concept that facilitates bundle-specific tractography based on a learned mapping from the original fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) peaks to a list of tract orientation maps (also abbr. TOM). Each TOM represents one of the known tracts with each voxel containing no more than one orientation vector. TOMs can act as a prior or even as direct input for tractography. We use an encoder-decoder fully-convolutional neural network architecture to learn the required mapping. In comparison to previous concepts for the reconstruction of specific bundles, the presented one avoids various cumbersome processing steps like whole brain tractography, atlas registration or clustering. We compare it to four state of the art bundle recognition methods on 20 different bundles in a total of 105 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. Results are anatomically convincing even for difficult tracts, while reaching low angular errors, unprecedented runtimes and top accuracy values (Dice). Our code and our data are openly available. 
### 288.From Self-ception to Image Self-ception: A method to represent an image  with its own approximations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05610.pdf)
> A concept of defining images based on its own approximate ones is proposed here, which is called 'Self-ception'. In this regard, an algorithm is proposed to implement the self-ception for images, which we call it 'Image Self-ception' since we use it for images. We can control the accuracy of this self-ception representation by deciding how many segments or regions we want to use for the representation. Some self-ception images are included in the paper. The video versions of the proposed image self-ception algorithm in action are shown in a YouTube channel (find it by Googling image self-ception). 
### 289.DynaSLAM: Tracking, Mapping and Inpainting in Dynamic Scenes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05620.pdf)
> The assumption of scene rigidity is typical in SLAM algorithms. Such a strong assumption limits the use of most visual SLAM systems in populated real-world environments, which are the target of several relevant applications like service robotics or autonomous vehicles. In this paper we present DynaSLAM, a visual SLAM system that, building over ORB-SLAM2 [1], adds the capabilities of dynamic object detection and background inpainting. DynaSLAM is robust in dynamic scenarios for monocular, stereo and RGB-D configurations. We are capable of detecting the moving objects either by multi-view geometry, deep learning or both. Having a static map of the scene allows inpainting the frame background that has been occluded by such dynamic objects. We evaluate our system in public monocular, stereo and RGB-D datasets. We study the impact of several accuracy/speed trade-offs to assess the limits of the proposed methodology. DynaSLAM outperforms the accuracy of standard visual SLAM baselines in highly dynamic scenarios. And it also estimates a map of the static parts of the scene, which is a must for long-term applications in real-world environments. 
### 290.HGR-Net: A Two-stage Convolutional Neural Network for Hand Gesture  Segmentation and Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05653.pdf)
> Robust recognition of hand gesture in real-world applications is still a challenging task due to the many aspects such as cluttered backgrounds and uncontrolled environment factors. In most existing methods hand segmentation is a primary step for hand gesture recognition, because it reduces redundant information from the image background, before passing them to the recognition stages. Therefore, in this paper we propose a two-stage deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called HGR-Net, where the first stage performs accurate pixel-level semantic segmentation into hand region and the second stage identifies hand gesture style. The segmentation stage architecture is based on the combination of fully convolutional deep residual neural network and atrous spatial pyramid pooling. Although the segmentation sub-network is trained without using depth information, it is robust enough against challenging situations such as changes in the lightning and complex backgrounds. In the recognition stage a two-stream CNN is used to obtain the best classification score. We also apply an effective data augmentation technique for maximizing the generalization capability of HGR-Net. Extensive experiments on public hand gesture datasets show that our deep architecture achieves prominent performance in segmentation and recognition for static hand gestures. 
### 291.Interactive Classification for Deep Learning Interpretation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05660.pdf)
> We present an interactive system enabling users to manipulate images to explore the robustness and sensitivity of deep learning image classifiers. Using modern web technologies to run in-browser inference, users can remove image features using inpainting algorithms and obtain new classifications in real time, which allows them to ask a variety of "what if" questions by experimentally modifying images and seeing how the model reacts. Our system allows users to compare and contrast what image regions humans and machine learning models use for classification, revealing a wide range of surprising results ranging from spectacular failures (e.g., a "water bottle" image becomes a "concert" when removing a person) to impressive resilience (e.g., a "baseball player" image remains correctly classified even without a glove or base). We demonstrate our system at The 2018 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) for the audience to try it live. Our system is open-sourced at <a href="https://github.com/poloclub/interactive-classification.">this https URL</a> A video demo is available at <a href="https://youtu.be/llub5GcOF6w.">this https URL</a> 
### 292.Learning Human Optical Flow [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05666.pdf)
> The optical flow of humans is well known to be useful for the analysis of human action. Given this, we devise an optical flow algorithm specifically for human motion and show that it is superior to generic flow methods. Designing a method by hand is impractical, so we develop a new training database of image sequences with ground truth optical flow. For this we use a 3D model of the human body and motion capture data to synthesize realistic flow fields. We then train a convolutional neural network to estimate human flow fields from pairs of images. Since many applications in human motion analysis depend on speed, and we anticipate mobile applications, we base our method on SpyNet with several modifications. We demonstrate that our trained network is more accurate than a wide range of top methods on held-out test data and that it generalizes well to real image sequences. When combined with a person detector/tracker, the approach provides a full solution to the problem of 2D human flow estimation. Both the code and the dataset are available for research. 
### 293.Action Learning for 3D Point Cloud Based Organ Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05724.pdf)
> We propose a novel point cloud based 3D organ segmentation pipeline utilizing deep Q-learning. In order to preserve shape properties, the learning process is guided using a statistical shape model. The trained agent directly predicts piece-wise linear transformations for all vertices in each iteration. This mapping between the ideal transformation for an object outline estimation is learned based on image features. To this end, we introduce aperture features that extract gray values by sampling the 3D volume within the cone centered around the associated vertex and its normal vector. Our approach is also capable of estimating a hierarchical pyramid of non rigid deformations for multi-resolution meshes. In the application phase, we use a marginal approach to gradually estimate affine as well as non-rigid transformations. We performed extensive evaluations to highlight the robust performance of our approach on a variety of challenge data as well as clinical data. Additionally, our method has a run time ranging from 0.3 to 2.7 seconds to segment each organ. In addition, we show that the proposed method can be applied to different organs, X-ray based modalities, and scanning protocols without the need of transfer learning. As we learn actions, even unseen reference meshes can be processed as demonstrated in an example with the Visible Human. From this we conclude that our method is robust, and we believe that our method can be successfully applied to many more applications, in particular, in the interventional imaging space. 
### 294.Age and Gender Classification From Ear Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05742.pdf)
> In this paper, we present a detailed analysis on extracting soft biometric traits, age and gender, from ear images. Although there have been a few previous work on gender classification using ear images, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first work on age classification from ear images. In the study, we have utilized both geometric features and appearance-based features for ear representation. The utilized geometric features are based on eight anthropometric landmarks and consist of 14 distance measurements and two area calculations. The appearance-based methods employ deep convolutional neural networks for representation and classification. The well-known convolutional neural network models, namely, AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogLeNet, and SqueezeNet have been adopted for the study. They have been fine-tuned on a large-scale ear dataset that has been built from the profile and close-to-profile face images in the Multi-PIE face dataset. This way, we have performed a domain adaptation. The updated models have been fine-tuned once more time on the small-scale target ear dataset, which contains only around 270 ear images for training. According to the experimental results, appearance-based methods have been found to be superior to the methods based on geometric features. We have achieved 94\% accuracy for gender classification, whereas 52\% accuracy has been obtained for age classification. These results indicate that ear images provide useful cues for age and gender classification, however, further work is required for age estimation. 
### 295.Generative Adversarial Networks and Perceptual Losses for Video  Super-Resolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05764.pdf)
> Video super-resolution has become one of the most critical problems in video processing. In the deep learning literature, recent works have shown the benefits of using perceptual losses to improve the performance on various image restoration tasks; however, these have yet to be applied for video super-resolution. In this work, we present the use of a very deep residual neural network, VSRResNet, for performing high-quality video super-resolution. We show that VSRResNet surpasses the current state-of-the-art VSR model, when compared with the PSNR/SSIM metric across most scale factors. Furthermore, we train this architecture with a convex combination of adversarial, feature-space and pixel-space loss to obtain the VSRResFeatGAN model. Finally, we compare the resulting VSR model with current state-of-the-art models using the PSNR, SSIM, and a novel perceptual distance metric, the PercepDist metric. With this latter metric, we show that the VSRResFeatGAN outperforms current state-of-the-art SR models, both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
### 296.Deep Learning Approximation: Zero-Shot Neural Network Speedup [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05779.pdf)
> Neural networks offer high-accuracy solutions to a range of problems, but are costly to run in production systems because of computational and memory requirements during a forward pass. Given a trained network, we propose a techique called Deep Learning Approximation to build a faster network in a tiny fraction of the time required for training by only manipulating the network structure and coefficients without requiring re-training or access to the training data. Speedup is achieved by by applying a sequential series of independent optimizations that reduce the floating-point operations (FLOPs) required to perform a forward pass. First, lossless optimizations are applied, followed by lossy approximations using singular value decomposition (SVD) and low-rank matrix decomposition. The optimal approximation is chosen by weighing the relative accuracy loss and FLOP reduction according to a single parameter specified by the user. On PASCAL VOC 2007 with the YOLO network, we show an end-to-end 2x speedup in a network forward pass with a 5% drop in mAP that can be re-gained by finetuning. 
### 297.A Survey of Automatic Facial Micro-expression Analysis: Databases,  Methods and Challenges [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05781.pdf)
> Over the last few years, automatic facial micro-expression analysis has garnered increasing attention from experts across different disciplines because of its potential applications in various fields such as clinical diagnosis, forensic investigation and security systems. Advances in computer algorithms and video acquisition technology have rendered machine analysis of facial micro-expressions possible today, in contrast to decades ago when it was primarily the domain of psychiatrists where analysis was largely manual. Indeed, although the study of facial micro-expressions is a well-established field in psychology, it is still relatively new from the computational perspective with many interesting problems. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art databases and methods for micro-expressions spotting and recognition. Individual stages involved in the automation of these tasks are also described and reviewed at length. In addition, we also deliberate on the challenges and future directions in this growing field of automatic facial micro-expression analysis. 
### 298.Random depthwise signed convolutional neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05789.pdf)
> Random weights in convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in previous studies yet remain below par compared to trained networks on image benchmarks. We explore depthwise convolutional neural networks with thousands of random filters in each layer, the sign activation function in between layers, and training performed only at the last layer with a linear support vector machine. We show that our network attains higher accuracies than previous random networks and is comparable to trained large networks on large images from the STL10 and ImageNet benchmarks. Since our network lacks a gradient due to the sign activation it is not possible to produce gradient-based adversarial examples targeting it. We show that our network is also less affected by gradient based adversarial examples produced from state of the art networks that considerably hamper their performance. As a possible explanation for our network's accuracy with random weights we show that the the margin of the linear support vector machine is larger on our final representation compared to the original dataset and increases with the number of random filters. Our network is simple and fast to train and predict, attains high classification accuracy particularly on large images, is hard to attack with adversarial examples, and is less affected by gradient based adversarial examples compared to state of the art networks. 
### 299.Recurrent Multiresolution Convolutional Networks for VHR Image  Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05793.pdf)
> Classification of very high resolution (VHR) satellite images has three major challenges: 1) inherent low intra-class and high inter-class spectral similarities, 2) mismatching resolution of available bands, and 3) the need to regularize noisy classification maps. Conventional methods have addressed these challenges by adopting separate stages of image fusion, feature extraction, and post-classification map regularization. These processing stages, however, are not jointly optimizing the classification task at hand. In this study, we propose a single-stage framework embedding the processing stages in a recurrent multiresolution convolutional network trained in an end-to-end manner. The feedforward version of the network, called FuseNet, aims to match the resolution of the panchromatic and multispectral bands in a VHR image using convolutional layers with corresponding downsampling and upsampling operations. Contextual label information is incorporated into FuseNet by means of a recurrent version called ReuseNet. We compared FuseNet and ReuseNet against the use of separate processing steps for both image fusion, e.g. pansharpening and resampling through interpolation, and map regularization such as conditional random fields. We carried out our experiments on a land cover classification task using a Worldview-03 image of Quezon City, Philippines and the ISPRS 2D semantic labeling benchmark dataset of Vaihingen, Germany. FuseNet and ReuseNet surpass the baseline approaches in both quantitative and qualitative results. 
### 300.Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Network for Objective Skill  Evaluation in Robot-assisted Surgery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05796.pdf)
> With the advent of robot-assisted surgery, the role of data-driven approaches to integrate statistics and machine learning is growing rapidly with prominent interests in objective surgical skill assessment. However, most existing work requires translating robot motion kinematics into intermediate features or gesture segments that are expensive to extract, lack efficiency, and require significant domain-specific knowledge. We propose an analytical deep learning framework for skill assessment in surgical training. A deep convolutional neural network is implemented to map multivariate time series data of the motion kinematics to individual skill levels. We perform experiments on the public minimally invasive surgical robotic dataset, JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS). Our proposed learning model achieved a competitive accuracy of 94.1%, 90.3%, and 86.8%, in the standard training tasks: Suturing, Needle-passing, and Knot-tying, respectively. Without the need of engineered features or carefully-tuned gesture segmentation, our model can successfully decode skill information from raw motion profiles via end-to-end learning. Meanwhile, the proposed model is able to reliably interpret skills within 1-3 second window, without needing an observation of entire training trial. This study highlights the potentials of deep architectures for an proficient online skill assessment in modern surgical training. 
### 301.SATR-DL: Improving Surgical Skill Assessment and Task Recognition in  Robot-assisted Surgery with Deep Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05798.pdf)
> Purpose: This paper focuses on an automated analysis of surgical motion profiles for objective skill assessment and task recognition in robot-assisted surgery. Existing techniques heavily rely on conventional statistic measures or shallow modelings based on hand-engineered features and gesture segmentation. Such developments require significant expert knowledge, are prone to errors, and are less efficient in online adaptive training systems. Methods: In this work, we present an efficient analytic framework with a parallel deep learning architecture, SATR-DL, to assess trainee expertise and recognize surgical training activity. Through an end-to-end learning technique, abstract information of spatial representations and temporal dynamics is jointly obtained directly from raw motion sequences. Results: By leveraging a shared high-level representation learning, the resulting model is successful in the recognition of trainee skills and surgical tasks, suturing, needle-passing, and knot-tying. Meanwhile, we explore the use of ensemble in classification at the trial level, where the SATR-DL outperforms state-of-the-art performance by achieving accuracies of 0.960 and 1.000 in skill assessment and task recognition, respectively. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of SATR-DL to provide improvements for an efficient data-driven assessment in intelligent robotic surgery. 
### 302.Unsupervised Deep Image Hashing through Tag Embeddings [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05804.pdf)
> Many approaches to semantic image hashing have been formulated as supervised learning problems that utilize images and label information to learn the binary hash codes. However, large-scale labelled image data is expensive to obtain, thus imposing a restriction on the usage of such algorithms. On the other hand, unlabelled image data is abundant due to the existence of many Web image repositories. Such Web images may often come with images tags that contains useful information, although raw tags in general do not readily lead to semantic labels. Motivated by this scenario, we formulate the problem of image hashing as an unsupervised learning problem. We utilize the information contained in the user-generated tags associated with the images to learn the hash codes. More specifically, we extract the word2vec semantic embeddings of the tags and use the information contained in them for constraining the learning. Accordingly, we name our model Unsupervised Deep Hashing using Tag Embeddings (UDHT). UDHT is tested for the task of semantic image retrieval and is compared against several state-of-art unsupervised models. Results show that our approach sets a new state-of-art in the area of unsupervised image hashing. 
### 303.Best sources forward: domain generalization through source-specific nets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05810.pdf)
> A long standing problem in visual object categorization is the ability of algorithms to generalize across different testing conditions. The problem has been formalized as a covariate shift among the probability distributions generating the training data (source) and the test data (target) and several domain adaptation methods have been proposed to address this issue. While these approaches have considered the single source-single target scenario, it is plausible to have multiple sources and require adaptation to any possible target domain. This last scenario, named Domain Generalization (DG), is the focus of our work. Differently from previous DG methods which learn domain invariant representations from source data, we design a deep network with multiple domain-specific classifiers, each associated to a source domain. At test time we estimate the probabilities that a target sample belongs to each source domain and exploit them to optimally fuse the classifiers predictions. To further improve the generalization ability of our model, we also introduced a domain agnostic component supporting the final classifier. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the power of our approach. 
### 304.Three dimensional Deep Learning approach for remote sensing image  classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05824.pdf)
> Recently, a variety of approaches has been enriching the field of Remote Sensing (RS) image processing and analysis. Unfortunately, existing methods remain limited faced to the rich spatio-spectral content of today's large datasets. It would seem intriguing to resort to Deep Learning (DL) based approaches at this stage with regards to their ability to offer accurate semantic interpretation of the data. However, the specificity introduced by the coexistence of spectral and spatial content in the RS datasets widens the scope of the challenges presented to adapt DL methods to these contexts. Therefore, the aim of this paper is firstly to explore the performance of DL architectures for the RS hyperspectral dataset classification and secondly to introduce a new three-dimensional DL approach that enables a joint spectral and spatial information process. A set of three-dimensional schemes is proposed and evaluated. Experimental results based on well knownhyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve a better classification rate than state of the art methods with lower computational costs. 
### 305.A simple blind-denoising filter inspired by electrically coupled  photoreceptors in the retina [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05882.pdf)
> Photoreceptors in the retina are coupled by electrical synapses called "gap junctions". It has long been established that gap junctions increase the signal-to-noise ratio of photoreceptors. Inspired by electrically coupled photoreceptors, we introduced a simple filter, the PR-filter, with only one variable. On BSD68 dataset, PR-filter showed outstanding performance in SSIM during blind denoising tasks. It also significantly improved the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network blind denosing on non-Gaussian noise. The performance of keeping more details might be attributed to small receptive field of the photoreceptors. 
### 306.Automated Image Data Preprocessing with Deep Reinforcement Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05886.pdf)
> Data preparation, i.e. the process of transforming raw data into a format that can be used for training effective machine learning models, is a tedious and time-consuming task. For image data, preprocessing typically involves a sequence of basic transformations such as cropping, filtering, rotating or flipping images. Currently, data scientists decide manually based on their experience which transformations to apply in which particular order to a given image data set. Besides constituting a bottleneck in real-world data science projects, manual image data preprocessing may yield suboptimal results as data scientists need to rely on intuition or trial-and-error approaches when exploring the space of possible image transformations and thus might not be able to discover the most effective ones. To mitigate the inefficiency and potential ineffectiveness of manual data preprocessing, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework to automatically discover the optimal data preprocessing steps for training an image classifier. The framework takes as input sets of labeled images and predefined preprocessing transformations. It jointly learns the classifier and the optimal preprocessing transformations for individual images. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only improves the accuracy of image classifiers, but also makes them substantially more robust to noisy inputs at test time. 
### 307.Learning Front-end Filter-bank Parameters using Convolutional Neural  Networks for Abnormal Heart Sound Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05892.pdf)
> Automatic heart sound abnormality detection can play a vital role in the early diagnosis of heart diseases, particularly in low-resource settings. The state-of-the-art algorithms for this task utilize a set of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) band-pass filters as a front-end followed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. In this work, we propound a novel CNN architecture that integrates the front-end bandpass filters within the network using time-convolution (tConv) layers, which enables the FIR filter-bank parameters to become learnable. Different initialization strategies for the learnable filters, including random parameters and a set of predefined FIR filter-bank coefficients, are examined. Using the proposed tConv layers, we add constraints to the learnable FIR filters to ensure linear and zero phase responses. Experimental evaluations are performed on a balanced 4-fold cross-validation task prepared using the PhysioNet/CinC 2016 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed models yield superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art system, while the linear phase FIR filterbank method provides an absolute improvement of 9.54% over the baseline in terms of an overall accuracy metric. 
### 308.Efficient Nearest Neighbors Search for Large-Scale Landmark Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05946.pdf)
> The problem of landmark recognition has achieved excellent results in small-scale datasets. When dealing with large-scale retrieval, issues that were irrelevant with small amount of data, quickly become fundamental for an efficient retrieval phase. In particular, computational time needs to be kept as low as possible, whilst the retrieval accuracy has to be preserved as much as possible. In this paper we propose a novel multi-index hashing method called Bag of Indexes (BoI) for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search. It allows to drastically reduce the query time and outperforms the accuracy results compared to the state-of-the-art methods for large-scale landmark recognition. It has been demonstrated that this family of algorithms can be applied on different embedding techniques like VLAD and R-MAC obtaining excellent results in very short times on different public datasets: Holidays+Flickr1M, Oxford105k and Paris106k. 
### 309.Boosted Training of Convolutional Neural Networks for Multi-Class  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05974.pdf)
> Training deep neural networks on large and sparse datasets is still challenging and can require large amounts of computation and memory. In this work, we address the task of performing semantic segmentation on large volumetric data sets, such as CT scans. Our contribution is threefold: 1) We propose a boosted sampling scheme that uses a-posterior error maps, generated throughout training, to focus sampling on difficult regions, resulting in a more informative loss. This results in a significant training speed up and improves learning performance for image segmentation. 2) We propose a novel algorithm for boosting the SGD learning rate schedule by adaptively increasing and lowering the learning rate, avoiding the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. 3) We show that our method is able to attain new state-of-the-art results on the VISCERAL Anatomy benchmark. 
### 310.Ego-Lane Analysis System (ELAS): Dataset and Algorithms [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05984.pdf)
> Decreasing costs of vision sensors and advances in embedded hardware boosted lane related research detection, estimation, and tracking in the past two decades. The interest in this topic has increased even more with the demand for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and self-driving cars. Although extensively studied independently, there is still need for studies that propose a combined solution for the multiple problems related to the ego-lane, such as lane departure warning (LDW), lane change detection, lane marking type (LMT) classification, road markings detection and classification, and detection of adjacent lanes (i.e., immediate left and right lanes) presence. In this paper, we propose a real-time Ego-Lane Analysis System (ELAS) capable of estimating ego-lane position, classifying LMTs and road markings, performing LDW and detecting lane change events. The proposed vision-based system works on a temporal sequence of images. Lane marking features are extracted in perspective and Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) images that are combined to increase robustness. The final estimated lane is modeled as a spline using a combination of methods (Hough lines with Kalman filter and spline with particle filter). Based on the estimated lane, all other events are detected. To validate ELAS and cover the lack of lane datasets in the literature, a new dataset with more than 20 different scenes (in more than 15,000 frames) and considering a variety of scenarios (urban road, highways, traffic, shadows, etc.) was created. The dataset was manually annotated and made publicly available to enable evaluation of several events that are of interest for the research community (i.e., lane estimation, change, and centering; road markings; intersections; LMTs; crosswalks and adjacent lanes). ELAS achieved high detection rates in all real-world events and proved to be ready for real-time applications. 
### 311.Partially-Supervised Image Captioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06004.pdf)
> Image captioning models are becoming increasingly successful at describing the content of images in restricted domains. However, if these models are to function in the wild - for example, as aids for the visually impaired - a much larger number and variety of visual concepts must be understood. In this work, we teach image captioning models new visual concepts with partial supervision, such as available from object detection and image label datasets. As these datasets contain text fragments rather than complete captions, we formulate this problem as learning from incomplete data. To flexibly characterize our uncertainty about the unobserved complete sequence, we represent each incomplete training sequence with its own finite state automaton encoding acceptable complete sequences. We then propose a novel algorithm for training sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks, on incomplete sequences specified in this manner. In the context of image captioning, our method lifts the restriction that previously required image captioning models to be trained on paired image-sentence corpora only, or otherwise required specialized model architectures to take advantage of alternative data modalities. Applying our approach to an existing neural captioning model, we achieve state of the art results on the novel object captioning task using the COCO dataset. We further show that we can train a captioning model to describe new visual concepts from the Open Images dataset while maintaining competitive COCO evaluation scores. 
### 312.One-Shot Unsupervised Cross Domain Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06029.pdf)
> Given a single image x from domain A and a set of images from domain B, our task is to generate the analogous of x in B. We argue that this task could be a key AI capability that underlines the ability of cognitive agents to act in the world and present empirical evidence that the existing unsupervised domain translation methods fail on this task. Our method follows a two step process. First, a variational autoencoder for domain B is trained. Then, given the new sample x, we create a variational autoencoder for domain A by adapting the layers that are close to the image in order to directly fit x, and only indirectly adapt the other layers. Our experiments indicate that the new method does as well, when trained on one sample x, as the existing domain transfer methods, when these enjoy a multitude of training samples from domain A. Our code is made publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/sagiebenaim/OneShotTranslation">this https URL</a> 
### 313.Seeing Neural Networks Through a Box of Toys: The Toybox Dataset of  Visual Object Transformations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06034.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enjoyed tremendous success in computer vision in the past several years, particularly for visual object recognition.However, how CNNs work remains poorly understood, and the training of deep CNNs is still considered more art than science. To better characterize deep CNNs and the training process, we introduce a new video dataset called Toybox. Images in Toybox come from first-person, wearable camera recordings of common household objects and toys being manually manipulated to undergo structured transformations like rotations and translations. We also present results from initial experiments using deep CNNs that begin to examine how different distributions of training data can affect visual object recognition performance, and how visual object concepts are represented within a trained network. 
### 314.Deep Lip Reading: a comparison of models and an online application [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06053.pdf)
> The goal of this paper is to develop state-of-the-art models for lip reading -- visual speech recognition. We develop three architectures and compare their accuracy and training times: (i) a recurrent model using LSTMs; (ii) a fully convolutional model; and (iii) the recently proposed transformer model. The recurrent and fully convolutional models are trained with a Connectionist Temporal Classification loss and use an explicit language model for decoding, the transformer is a sequence-to-sequence model. Our best performing model improves the state-of-the-art word error rate on the challenging BBC-Oxford Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) benchmark dataset by over 20 percent. <br />As a further contribution we investigate the fully convolutional model when used for online (real time) lip reading of continuous speech, and show that it achieves high performance with low latency. 
### 315.Unsupervised Training for 3D Morphable Model Regression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06098.pdf)
> We present a method for training a regression network from image pixels to 3D morphable model coordinates using only unlabeled photographs. The training loss is based on features from a facial recognition network, computed on-the-fly by rendering the predicted faces with a differentiable renderer. To make training from features feasible and avoid network fooling effects, we introduce three objectives: a batch distribution loss that encourages the output distribution to match the distribution of the morphable model, a loopback loss that ensures the network can correctly reinterpret its own output, and a multi-view identity loss that compares the features of the predicted 3D face and the input photograph from multiple viewing angles. We train a regression network using these objectives, a set of unlabeled photographs, and the morphable model itself, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results. 
### 316.Object Level Visual Reasoning in Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06157.pdf)
> Human activity recognition is typically addressed by detecting key concepts like global and local motion, features related to object classes present in the scene, as well as features related to the global context. The next open challenges in activity recognition require a level of understanding that pushes beyond this and call for models with capabilities for fine distinction and detailed comprehension of interactions between actors and objects in a scene. We propose a model capable of learning to reason about semantically meaningful spatiotemporal interactions in videos. The key to our approach is a choice of performing this reasoning at the object level through the integration of state of the art object detection networks. This allows the model to learn detailed spatial interactions that exist at a semantic, object-interaction relevant level. We evaluate our method on three standard datasets (Twenty-BN Something-Something, VLOG and EPIC Kitchens) and achieve state of the art results on all of them. Finally, we show visualizations of the interactions learned by the model, which illustrate object classes and their interactions corresponding to different activity classes. 
### 317.Semantic Video Segmentation: A Review on Recent Approaches [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06172.pdf)
> This paper gives an overview on semantic segmentation consists of an explanation of this field, it's status and relation with other vision fundamental tasks, different datasets and common evaluation parameters that have been used by researchers. This survey also includes an overall review on a variety of recent approaches (RDF, MRF, CRF, etc.) and their advantages and challenges and shows the superiority of CNN-based semantic segmentation systems on CamVid and NYUDv2 datasets. In addition, some areas that is ideal for future work have mentioned. 
### 318.Riemannian kernel based Nystr&#xf6;m method for approximate  infinite-dimensional covariance descriptors with application to image set  classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06177.pdf)
> In the domain of pattern recognition, using the CovDs (Covariance Descriptors) to represent data and taking the metrics of the resulting Riemannian manifold into account have been widely adopted for the task of image set classification. Recently, it has been proven that infinite-dimensional CovDs are more discriminative than their low-dimensional counterparts. However, the form of infinite-dimensional CovDs is implicit and the computational load is high. We propose a novel framework for representing image sets by approximating infinite-dimensional CovDs in the paradigm of the Nystr\"om method based on a Riemannian kernel. We start by modeling the images via CovDs, which lie on the Riemannian manifold spanned by SPD (Symmetric Positive Definite) matrices. We then extend the Nystr\"om method to the SPD manifold and obtain the approximations of CovDs in RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space). Finally, we approximate infinite-dimensional CovDs via these approximations. Empirically, we apply our framework to the task of image set classification. The experimental results obtained on three benchmark datasets show that our proposed approximate infinite-dimensional CovDs outperform the original CovDs. 
### 319.Component SPD Matrices: A lower-dimensional discriminative data  descriptor for image set classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06178.pdf)
> In the domain of pattern recognition, using the SPD (Symmetric Positive Definite) matrices to represent data and taking the metrics of resulting Riemannian manifold into account have been widely used for the task of image set classification. In this paper, we propose a new data representation framework for image sets named CSPD (Component Symmetric Positive Definite). Firstly, we obtain sub-image sets by dividing the image set into square blocks with the same size, and use traditional SPD model to describe them. Then, we use the results of the Riemannian kernel on SPD matrices as similarities of corresponding sub-image sets. Finally, the CSPD matrix appears in the form of the kernel matrix for all the sub-image sets, and CSPDi,j denotes the similarity between i-th sub-image set and j-th sub-image set. Here, the Riemannian kernel is shown to satisfy the Mercer's theorem, so our proposed CSPD matrix is symmetric and positive definite and also lies on a Riemannian manifold. On three benchmark datasets, experimental results show that CSPD is a lower-dimensional and more discriminative data descriptor for the task of image set classification. 
### 320.The Neural Painter: Multi-Turn Image Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06183.pdf)
> In this work we combine two research threads from Vision/ Graphics and Natural Language Processing to formulate an image generation task conditioned on attributes in a multi-turn setting. By multiturn, we mean the image is generated in a series of steps of user-specified conditioning information. Our proposed approach is practically useful and offers insights into neural interpretability. We introduce a framework that includes a novel training algorithm as well as model improvements built for the multi-turn setting. We demonstrate that this framework generates a sequence of images that match the given conditioning information and that this task is useful for more detailed benchmarking and analysis of conditional image generation methods. 
### 321.Large Scale Fine-Grained Categorization and Domain-Specific Transfer  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06193.pdf)
> Transferring the knowledge learned from large scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet) via fine-tuning offers an effective solution for domain-specific fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) tasks (e.g., recognizing bird species or car make and model). In such scenarios, data annotation often calls for specialized domain knowledge and thus is difficult to scale. In this work, we first tackle a problem in large scale FGVC. Our method won first place in iNaturalist 2017 large scale species classification challenge. Central to the success of our approach is a training scheme that uses higher image resolution and deals with the long-tailed distribution of training data. Next, we study transfer learning via fine-tuning from large scale datasets to small scale, domain-specific FGVC datasets. We propose a measure to estimate domain similarity via Earth Mover's Distance and demonstrate that transfer learning benefits from pre-training on a source domain that is similar to the target domain by this measure. Our proposed transfer learning outperforms ImageNet pre-training and obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple commonly used FGVC datasets. 
### 322.Show, Attend and Translate: Unsupervised Image Translation with  Self-Regularization and Attention [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06195.pdf)
> Image translation between two domains is a class of problems aiming to learn mapping from an input image in the source domain to an output image in the target domain. It has been applied to numerous domains, such as data augmentation, domain adaptation, and unsupervised training. When paired training data is not accessible, image translation becomes an ill-posed problem. We constrain the problem with the assumption that the translated image needs to be perceptually similar to the original image and also appears to be drawn from the new domain, and propose a simple yet effective image translation model consisting of a single generator trained with a self-regularization term and an adversarial term. We further notice that existing image translation techniques are agnostic to the subjects of interest and often introduce unwanted changes or artifacts to the input. Thus we propose to add an attention module to predict an attention map to guide the image translation process. The module learns to attend to key parts of the image while keeping everything else unaltered, essentially avoiding undesired artifacts or changes. The predicted attention map also opens door to applications such as unsupervised segmentation and saliency detection. Extensive experiments and evaluations show that our model while being simpler, achieves significantly better performance than existing image translation methods. 
### 323.Part-Aware Fine-grained Object Categorization using Weakly Supervised  Part Detection Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06198.pdf)
> Fine-grained object categorization aims for distinguishing objects of subordinate categories that belong to the same entry-level object category. The task is challenging due to the facts that (1) training images with ground-truth labels are difficult to obtain, and (2) variations among different subordinate categories are subtle. It is well established that characterizing features of different subordinate categories are located on local parts of object instances. In fact, careful part annotations are available in many fine-grained categorization datasets. However, manually annotating object parts requires expertise, which is also difficult to generalize to new fine-grained categorization tasks. In this work, we propose a Weakly Supervised Part Detection Network (PartNet) that is able to detect discriminative local parts for use of fine-grained categorization. A vanilla PartNet builds on top of a base subnetwork two parallel streams of upper network layers, which respectively compute scores of classification probabilities (over subordinate categories) and detection probabilities (over a specified number of discriminative part detectors) for local regions of interest (RoIs). The image-level prediction is obtained by aggregating element-wise products of these region-level probabilities. To generate a diverse set of RoIs as inputs of PartNet, we propose a simple Discretized Part Proposals module (DPP) that directly targets for proposing candidates of discriminative local parts, with no bridging via object-level proposals. Experiments on the benchmark CUB-200-2011 and Oxford Flower 102 datasets show the efficacy of our proposed method for both discriminative part detection and fine-grained categorization. In particular, we achieve the new state-of-the-art performance on CUB-200-2011 dataset when ground-truth part annotations are not available. 
### 324.Offline Extraction of Indic Regional Language from Natural Scene Image  using Text Segmentation and Deep Convolutional Sequence [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06208.pdf)
> Regional language extraction from a natural scene image is always a challenging proposition due to its dependence on the text information extracted from Image. Text Extraction on the other hand varies on different lighting condition, arbitrary orientation, inadequate text information, heavy background influence over text and change of text appearance. This paper presents a novel unified method for tackling the above challenges. The proposed work uses an image correction and segmentation technique on the existing Text Detection Pipeline an Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector (EAST). EAST uses standard PVAnet architecture to select features and non maximal suppression to detect text from image. Text recognition is done using combined architecture of MaxOut convolution neural network (CNN) and Bidirectional long short term memory (LSTM) network. After recognizing text using the Deep Learning based approach, the native Languages are translated to English and tokenized using standard Text Tokenizers. The tokens that very likely represent a location is used to find the Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of the location and subsequently the regional languages spoken in that location is extracted. The proposed method is tested on a self generated dataset collected from Government of India dataset and experimented on Standard Dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique. Comparative study with a few state-of-the-art methods on text detection, recognition and extraction of regional language from images shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods. 
### 325.Real-time Prediction of Segmentation Quality [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06244.pdf)
> Recent advances in deep learning based image segmentation methods have enabled real-time performance with human-level accuracy. However, occasionally even the best method fails due to low image quality, artifacts or unexpected behaviour of black box algorithms. Being able to predict segmentation quality in the absence of ground truth is of paramount importance in clinical practice, but also in large-scale studies to avoid the inclusion of invalid data in subsequent analysis. <br />In this work, we propose two approaches of real-time automated quality control for cardiovascular MR segmentations using deep learning. First, we train a neural network on 12,880 samples to predict Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) on a per-case basis. We report a mean average error (MAE) of 0.03 on 1,610 test samples and 97% binary classification accuracy for separating low and high quality segmentations. Secondly, in the scenario where no manually annotated data is available, we train a network to predict DSC scores from estimated quality obtained via a reverse testing strategy. We report an MAE=0.14 and 91% binary classification accuracy for this case. Predictions are obtained in real-time which, when combined with real-time segmentation methods, enables instant feedback on whether an acquired scan is analysable while the patient is still in the scanner. This further enables new applications of optimising image acquisition towards best possible analysis results. 
### 326.Latent Convolutional Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06284.pdf)
> We present a new latent model of natural images that can be learned on large-scale datasets. The learning process provides a latent embedding for every image in the training dataset, as well as a deep convolutional network that maps the latent space to the image space. After training, the new model provides a strong and universal image prior for a variety of image restoration tasks such as large-hole inpainting, superresolution, and colorization. To model high-resolution natural images, our approach uses latent spaces of very high dimensionality (one to two orders of magnitude higher than previous latent image models). To tackle this high dimensionality, we use latent spaces with a special manifold structure (convolutional manifolds) parameterized by a ConvNet of a certain architecture. In the experiments, we compare the learned latent models with latent models learned by autoencoders, advanced variants of generative adversarial networks, and a strong baseline system using simpler parameterization of the latent space. Our model outperforms the competing approaches over a range of restoration tasks. 
### 327.MedGAN: Medical Image Translation using GANs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06397.pdf)
> Image-to-image translation is considered a next frontier in the field of medical image analysis, with numerous potential applications. However, recent advances in this field offer individualized solutions by utilizing specialized architectures which are task specific or by suffering from limited capacities and thus requiring refinement through non end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose a novel general purpose framework for medical image-to-image translation, titled MedGAN, which operates in an end-to-end manner on the image level. MedGAN builds upon recent advances in the field of generative adversarial networks(GANs) by combining the adversarial framework with a unique combination of non-adversarial losses which captures the high and low frequency components of the desired target modality. Namely, we utilize a discriminator network as a trainable feature extractor which penalizes the discrepancy between the translated medical images and the desired modalities in the pixel and perceptual sense. Moreover, style-transfer losses are utilized to match the textures and fine-structures of the desired target images to the outputs. Additionally, we present a novel generator architecture, titled CasNet, which enhances the sharpness of the translated medical outputs through progressive refinement via encoder decoder pairs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply MedGAN on three novel and challenging applications: PET-CT translation, correction of MR motion artefacts and PET image denoising. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques have emphasized the superior performance of the proposed framework. MedGAN can be directly applied as a general framework for future medical translation tasks. 
### 328.High Speed Kernelized Correlation Filters without Boundary Effect [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06406.pdf)
> Recently, correlation filter based trackers (CF trackers) have attracted much attention in vision community because of their top performance in both location and speed. However, the boundary effect imposed by the periodic assumption for the efficient optimization seriously limits their location accuracy. Although there existed many modern works to relax the boundary effect of CF trackers, they all are not able to eliminate the boundary effect thoroughly as well as exploit the kernel trick to improve their location accuracy, and their speeds are reduced greatly. Either relaxing the boundary effect or being able to exploit kernel trick to improve the accuracy, and either relaxing the boundary effect or keeping CF trackers running at high speed have been two dilemmas in the society of visual tracking. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a high speed kernel correlation filter without the boundary effect (nBEKCF). Unlike all current CF trackers which exploited real and virtual image patches to train their regression functions, we construct a set of non-orthogonal bases with a group of circulant basic samples and utilize a function defined in Hilbert space and a set of densely sampled, totally real patches to regress a Gaussian goal. This way, the boundary effect is eliminated thoroughly in theory and the kernel trick can be employed naturally. To ensure nBEKCF runs at high speed, we present two efficient algorithms, ACSII and CCIM, to significantly accelerate the evaluation of kernel matrix without employing FFT. By exploiting the circulant structure of basic samples, the efficiency of CCIM in evaluating correlation exceeds that of FFT remarkably. Preliminary experimental results on two public datasets, OTB2013 and OTB2015, show that, without bells and whistles, nBEKCF outperforms representative trackers with hand-crafted features, in the meanwhile, runs at 70 fps on average. 
### 329.High-speed Tracking with Multi-kernel Correlation Filters [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06418.pdf)
> Correlation filter (CF) based trackers are currently ranked top in terms of their performances. Nevertheless, only some of them, such as KCF~\cite{henriques15} and MKCF~\cite{tangm15}, are able to exploit the powerful discriminability of non-linear kernels. Although MKCF achieves more powerful discriminability than KCF through introducing multi-kernel learning (MKL) into KCF, its improvement over KCF is quite limited and its computational burden increases significantly in comparison with KCF. In this paper, we will introduce the MKL into KCF in a different way than MKCF. We reformulate the MKL version of CF objective function with its upper bound, alleviating the negative mutual interference of different kernels significantly. Our novel MKCF tracker, MKCFup, outperforms KCF and MKCF with large margins and can still work at very high fps. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our method is superior to state-of-the-art algorithms for target objects of small move at very high speed. 
### 330.Learning to Evaluate Image Captioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06422.pdf)
> Evaluation metrics for image captioning face two challenges. Firstly, commonly used metrics such as CIDEr, METEOR, ROUGE and BLEU often do not correlate well with human judgments. Secondly, each metric has well known blind spots to pathological caption constructions, and rule-based metrics lack provisions to repair such blind spots once identified. For example, the newly proposed SPICE correlates well with human judgments, but fails to capture the syntactic structure of a sentence. To address these two challenges, we propose a novel learning based discriminative evaluation metric that is directly trained to distinguish between human and machine-generated captions. In addition, we further propose a data augmentation scheme to explicitly incorporate pathological transformations as negative examples during training. The proposed metric is evaluated with three kinds of robustness tests and its correlation with human judgments. Extensive experiments show that the proposed data augmentation scheme not only makes our metric more robust toward several pathological transformations, but also improves its correlation with human judgments. Our metric outperforms other metrics on both caption level human correlation in Flickr 8k and system level human correlation in COCO. The proposed approach could be served as a learning based evaluation metric that is complementary to existing rule-based metrics. 
### 331.A Novel Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Auto-Classification of Retinal  Diseases [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06423.pdf)
> Automatic clinical diagnosis of retinal diseases has emerged as a promising approach to facilitate discovery in areas with limited access to specialists. We propose a novel visual-assisted diagnosis hybrid model based on the support vector machine (SVM) and deep neural networks (DNNs). The model incorporates complementary strengths of DNNs and SVM. Furthermore, we present a new clinical retina label collection for ophthalmology incorporating 32 retina diseases classes. Using EyeNet, our model achieves 89.73% diagnosis accuracy and the model performance is comparable to the professional ophthalmologists. 
### 332.Deforming Autoencoders: Unsupervised Disentangling of Shape and  Appearance [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06503.pdf)
> In this work we introduce Deforming Autoencoders, a generative model for images that disentangles shape from appearance in an unsupervised manner. As in the deformable template paradigm, shape is represented as a deformation between a canonical coordinate system (`template') and an observed image, while appearance is modeled in `canonical', template, coordinates, thus discarding variability due to deformations. We introduce novel techniques that allow this approach to be deployed in the setting of autoencoders and show that this method can be used for unsupervised group-wise image alignment. We show experiments with expression morphing in humans, hands, and digits, face manipulation, such as shape and appearance interpolation, as well as unsupervised landmark localization. A more powerful form of unsupervised disentangling becomes possible in template coordinates, allowing us to successfully decompose face images into shading and albedo, and further manipulate face images. 
### 333.An Ensemble of Transfer, Semi-supervised and Supervised Learning Methods  for Pathological Heart Sound Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06506.pdf)
> In this work, we propose an ensemble of classifiers to distinguish between various degrees of abnormalities of the heart using Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals acquired using digital stethoscopes in a clinical setting, for the INTERSPEECH 2018 Computational Paralinguistics (ComParE) Heart Beats SubChallenge. Our primary classification framework constitutes a convolutional neural network with 1D-CNN time-convolution (tConv) layers, which uses features transferred from a model trained on the 2016 Physionet Heart Sound Database. We also employ a Representation Learning (RL) approach to generate features in an unsupervised manner using Deep Recurrent Autoencoders and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifiers. Finally, we utilize an SVM classifier on a high-dimensional segment-level feature extracted using various functionals on short-term acoustic features, i.e., Low-Level Descriptors (LLD). An ensemble of the three different approaches provides a relative improvement of 11.13% compared to our best single sub-system in terms of the Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) performance metric on the evaluation dataset. 
### 334.HitNet: a neural network with capsules embedded in a Hit-or-Miss layer,  extended with hybrid data augmentation and ghost capsules [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06519.pdf)
> Neural networks designed for the task of classification have become a commodity in recent years. Many works target the development of better networks, which results in a complexification of their architectures with more layers, multiple sub-networks, or even the combination of multiple classifiers. In this paper, we show how to redesign a simple network to reach excellent performances, which are better than the results reproduced with CapsNet on several datasets, by replacing a layer with a Hit-or-Miss layer. This layer contains activated vectors, called capsules, that we train to hit or miss a central capsule by tailoring a specific centripetal loss function. We also show how our network, named HitNet, is capable of synthesizing a representative sample of the images of a given class by including a reconstruction network. This possibility allows to develop a data augmentation step combining information from the data space and the feature space, resulting in a hybrid data augmentation process. In addition, we introduce the possibility for HitNet, to adopt an alternative to the true target when needed by using the new concept of ghost capsules, which is used here to detect potentially mislabeled images in the training data. 
### 335.Segmentation of Photovoltaic Module Cells in Electroluminescence Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06530.pdf)
> High resolution electroluminescence (EL) images captured in the infrared spectrum allow to visually and non-destructively inspect the quality of photovoltaic (PV) modules. Currently, however, such a visual inspection requires trained experts to discern different kind of defects, which is time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we make an important step towards improving the current state-of-the-art in solar module inspection. We propose a robust automated segmentation method to extract individual solar cells from EL images of PV modules. Automated segmentation of cells is a key step in automating the visual inspection workflow. It also enables controlled studies on large amounts of data to understanding the effects of module degradation over time - a process not yet fully understood. The proposed method infers in several steps a high level solar module representation from low-level edge features. An important step in the algorithm is to formulate the segmentation problem in terms of lens calibration by exploiting the plumbline constraint. We evaluate our method on a dataset of various solar modules types containing a total of 408 solar cells with various defects. Our method robustly solves this task with a median weighted Jaccard index of 96.09% and an $F_1$ score of 97.23%. 
### 336.RenderNet: A deep convolutional network for differentiable rendering  from 3D shapes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06575.pdf)
> Traditional computer graphics rendering pipeline is designed for procedurally generating 2D quality images from 3D shapes with high performance. The non-differentiability due to discrete operations such as visibility computation makes it hard to explicitly correlate rendering parameters and the resulting image, posing a significant challenge for inverse rendering tasks. Recent work on differentiable rendering achieves differentiability either by designing surrogate gradients for non-differentiable operations or via an approximate but differentiable renderer. These methods, however, are still limited when it comes to handling occlusion, and restricted to particular rendering effects. We present RenderNet, a differentiable rendering convolutional network with a novel projection unit that can render 2D images from 3D shapes. Spatial occlusion and shading calculation are automatically encoded in the network. Our experiments show that RenderNet can successfully learn to implement different shaders, and can be used in inverse rendering tasks to estimate shape, pose, lighting and texture from a single image. 
### 337.Deep Recurrent Neural Network for Multi-target Filtering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06594.pdf)
> This paper addresses the problem of fixed motion and measurement models for multi-target filtering using an adaptive learning framework. This is performed by defining target tuples with random finite set terminology and utilisation of recurrent neural networks with a long short-term memory architecture. A novel data association algorithm compatible with the predicted tracklet tuples is proposed, enabling the update of occluded targets, in addition to assigning birth, survival and death of targets. The algorithm is evaluated over a commonly used filtering simulation scenario, with highly promising results. 
### 338.Uncertainty in multitask learning: joint representations for  probabilistic MR-only radiotherapy planning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06595.pdf)
> Multi-task neural network architectures provide a mechanism that jointly integrates information from distinct sources. It is ideal in the context of MR-only radiotherapy planning as it can jointly regress a synthetic CT (synCT) scan and segment organs-at-risk (OAR) from MRI. We propose a probabilistic multi-task network that estimates: 1) intrinsic uncertainty through a heteroscedastic noise model for spatially-adaptive task loss weighting and 2) parameter uncertainty through approximate Bayesian inference. This allows sampling of multiple segmentations and synCTs that share their network representation. We test our model on prostate cancer scans and show that it produces more accurate and consistent synCTs with a better estimation in the variance of the errors, state of the art results in OAR segmentation and a methodology for quality assurance in radiotherapy treatment planning. 
### 339.On Multi-resident Activity Recognition in Ambient Smart-Homes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06611.pdf)
> Increasing attention to the research on activity monitoring in smart homes has motivated the employment of ambient intelligence to reduce the deployment cost and solve the privacy issue. Several approaches have been proposed for multi-resident activity recognition, however, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark for future research and practical selection of models. In this paper we study different methods for multi-resident activity recognition and evaluate them on same sets of data. The experimental results show that recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units is better than other models and also considerably efficient, and that using combined activities as single labels is more effective than represent them as separate labels. 
### 340.Banach Wasserstein GAN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06621.pdf)
> Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) can be used to generate realistic samples from complicated image distributions. The Wasserstein metric used in WGANs is based on a notion of distance between individual images, which induces a notion of distance between probability distributions of images. So far the community has considered $\ell^2$ as the underlying distance. We generalize the theory of WGAN with gradient penalty to Banach spaces, allowing practitioners to select the features to emphasize in the generator. We further discuss the effect of some particular choices of underlying norms, focusing on Sobolev norms. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of the choice of norm on model performance and show state-of-the-art inception scores for non-progressive growing GANs on CIFAR-10. 
### 341.Assessing robustness of radiomic features by image perturbation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06719.pdf)
> Image features need to be robust against differences in positioning, acquisition and segmentation to ensure reproducibility. Radiomic models that only include robust features can be used to analyse new images, whereas models with non-robust features may fail to predict the outcome of interest accurately. Test-retest imaging is recommended to assess robustness, but may not be available for the phenotype of interest. We therefore investigated 18 methods to determine feature robustness based on image perturbations. Test-retest and perturbation robustness were compared for 4032 features that were computed from the gross tumour volume in two cohorts with computed tomography imaging: I) 31 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; II): 19 head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Robustness was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (1,1) (ICC). Features with ICC$\geq0.90$ were considered robust. The NSCLC cohort contained more robust features for test-retest imaging than the HNSCC cohort ($73.5\%$ vs. $34.0\%$). A perturbation chain consisting of noise addition, affine translation, volume growth/shrinkage and supervoxel-based contour randomisation identified the fewest false positive robust features (NSCLC: $3.3\%$; HNSCC: $10.0\%$). Thus, this perturbation chain may be used to assess feature robustness. 
### 342.Kid-Net: Convolution Networks for Kidney Vessels Segmentation from  CT-Volumes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06769.pdf)
> Semantic image segmentation plays an important role in modeling patient-specific anatomy. We propose a convolution neural network, called Kid-Net, along with a training schema to segment kidney vessels: artery, vein and collecting system. Such segmentation is vital during the surgical planning phase in which medical decisions are made before surgical incision. Our main contribution is developing a training schema that handles unbalanced data, reduces false positives and enables high-resolution segmentation with a limited memory budget. These objectives are attained using dynamic weighting, random sampling and 3D patch segmentation. Manual medical image annotation is both time-consuming and expensive. Kid-Net reduces kidney vessels segmentation time from matter of hours to minutes. It is trained end-to-end using 3D patches from volumetric CT-images. A complete segmentation for a 512x512x512 CT-volume is obtained within a few minutes (1-2 mins) by stitching the output 3D patches together. Feature down-sampling and up-sampling are utilized to achieve higher classification and localization accuracies. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation results on a challenging testing dataset show Kid-Net competence. 
### 343.BinGAN: Learning Compact Binary Descriptors with a Regularized GAN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06778.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel regularization method for Generative Adversarial Networks, which allows the model to learn discriminative yet compact binary representations of image patches (image descriptors). We employ the dimensionality reduction that takes place in the intermediate layers of the discriminator network and train binarized low-dimensional representation of the penultimate layer to mimic the distribution of the higher-dimensional preceding layers. To achieve this, we introduce two loss terms that aim at: (i) reducing the correlation between the dimensions of the binarized low-dimensional representation of the penultimate layer i. e. maximizing joint entropy) and (ii) propagating the relations between the dimensions in the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional space. We evaluate the resulting binary image descriptors on two challenging applications, image matching and retrieval, and achieve state-of-the-art results. 
### 344.Deep Spatiotemporal Representation of the Face for Automatic Pain  Intensity Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06793.pdf)
> Automatic pain intensity assessment has a high value in disease diagnosis applications. Inspired by the fact that many diseases and brain disorders can interrupt normal facial expression formation, we aim to develop a computational model for automatic pain intensity assessment from spontaneous and micro facial variations. For this purpose, we propose a 3D deep architecture for dynamic facial video representation. The proposed model is built by stacking several convolutional modules where each module encompasses a 3D convolution kernel with a fixed temporal depth, several parallel 3D convolutional kernels with different temporal depths, and an average pooling layer. Deploying variable temporal depths in the proposed architecture allows the model to effectively capture a wide range of spatiotemporal variations on the faces. Extensive experiments on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive database show that our proposed model yields in a promising performance compared to the state-of-the-art in automatic pain intensity estimation. 
### 345.Temporal coherence-based self-supervised learning for laparoscopic  workflow analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06811.pdf)
> In order to provide the right type of assistance at the right time, computer-assisted surgery systems need context awareness. To achieve this, methods for surgical workflow analysis are crucial. Currently, convolutional neural networks provide the best performance for video-based workflow analysis tasks. For training such networks, large amounts of annotated data are necessary. However, collecting a sufficient amount of data is often costly, time-consuming, and not always feasible. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting and comparing different approaches for self-supervised pretraining of neural networks on unlabeled laparoscopic videos using temporal coherence. We evaluate our pretrained networks on Cholec80, a publicly available dataset for surgical phase segmentation, on which a maximum F1 score of 84.6 was reached. Furthermore, we were able to achieve an increase of the F1 score of up to 10 points when compared to a non-pretrained neural network. 
### 346.Automated Bridge Component Recognition using Video Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06820.pdf)
> This paper investigates the automated recognition of structural bridge components using video data. Although understanding video data for structural inspections is straightforward for human inspectors, the implementation of the same task using machine learning methods has not been fully realized. In particular, single-frame image processing techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are not expected to identify structural components accurately when the image is a close-up view, lacking contextual information regarding where on the structure the image originates. Inspired by the significant progress in video processing techniques, this study investigates automated bridge component recognition using video data, where the information from the past frames is used to augment the understanding of the current frame. A new simulated video dataset is created to train the machine learning algorithms. Then, convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with recurrent architectures are designed and applied to implement the automated bridge component recognition task. Results are presented for simulated video data, as well as video collected in the field. 
### 347.Manifold Learning &amp; Stacked Sparse Autoencoder for Robust Breast Cancer  Classification from Histopathological Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06876.pdf)
> Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of histopathological images (HI) requires efficient structural representation of the underlying surface tissue convolutions as manifested by the diverse breast cancerous (BC) tissue morphology. In this contribution, HI are modelled as spatially-progressive lower dimensional dynamical patterns embedded in the higher dimensional HI space. Manifold learning on these HI point-cloud is envisaged by LandMark ISOMAP (L-ISOMAP) for isometric feature mapping. The dimensionality reduced L-ISOMAP descriptors are cascaded with stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) for learning deep textural feature and tumor malignancy detection thereof. Classification accuracy of 99.4% obtained on publicly available BreaKHis dataset outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and validates it's adequacy as an adjunct tool to clinicians in confirming their diagnosis. Further, employing L-Isomap based manifold embedding, the dimensionality of HI are reduced drastically without significant loss in its discriminating competency. These relieves the GPU requirement for SSAE aided deep learning. Experimental results are discussed in detail. 
### 348.Learning to Decode 7T-like MR Image Reconstruction from 3T MR Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06886.pdf)
> Increasing demand for high field magnetic resonance (MR) scanner indicates the need for high-quality MR images for accurate medical diagnosis. However, cost constraints, instead, motivate a need for algorithms to enhance images from low field scanners. We propose an approach to process the given low field (3T) MR image slices to reconstruct the corresponding high field (7T-like) slices. Our framework involves a novel architecture of a merged convolutional autoencoder with a single encoder and multiple decoders. Specifically, we employ three decoders with random initializations, and the proposed training approach involves selection of a particular decoder in each weight-update iteration for back propagation. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms some related contemporary methods in terms of performance and reconstruction time. 
### 349.Learning Object Localization and 6D Pose Estimation from Simulation and  Weakly Labeled Real Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06888.pdf)
> This work proposes a process for efficiently training a point-wise object detector that enables localizing objects and computing their 6D poses in cluttered and occluded scenes. Accurate pose estimation is typically a requirement for robust robotic grasping and manipulation of objects placed in cluttered, tight environments, such as a shelf with multiple objects. To minimize the human labor required for annotation, the proposed object detector is first trained in simulation by using automatically annotated synthetic images. We then show that the performance of the detector can be substantially improved by using a small set of weakly annotated real images, where a human provides only a list of objects present in each image without indicating the location of the objects. To close the gap between real and synthetic images, we adopt a domain adaptation approach through adversarial training. The detector resulting from this training process can be used to localize objects by using its per-object activation maps. In this work, we use the activation maps to guide the search of 6D poses of objects. Our proposed approach is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for pose estimation. We also evaluated our model on classification and localization in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. The results clearly indicate that this approach could provide an efficient way toward fully automating the training process of computer vision models used in robotics. 
### 350.Bayesian Prediction of Future Street Scenes through Importance Sampling  based Optimization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06939.pdf)
> For autonomous agents to successfully operate in the real world, anticipation of future events and states of their environment is a key competence. This problem can be formalized as a sequence prediction problem, where a number of observations are used to predict the sequence into the future. However, real-world scenarios demand a model of uncertainty of such predictions, as future states become increasingly uncertain and multi-modal -- in particular on long time horizons. This makes modelling and learning challenging. We cast state of the art semantic segmentation and future prediction models based on deep learning into a Bayesian formulation that in turn allows for a full Bayesian treatment of the prediction problem. We present a new sampling scheme for this model that draws from the success of variational autoencoders by incorporating a recognition network. In the experiments we show that our model outperforms prior work in accuracy of the predicted segmentation and provides calibrated probabilities that also better capture the multi-modal aspects of possible future states of street scenes. 
### 351.Deconvolving convolution neural network for cell detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06970.pdf)
> Automatic cell detection in histology images is a challenging task due to varying size, shape and features of cells and stain variations across a large cohort. Conventional deep learning methods regress the probability of each pixel belonging to the centre of a cell followed by detection of local maxima. We present deconvolution as an alternate approach to local maxima detection. The ground truth points are convolved with a mapping filter to generate artifical labels. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is modified to convolve it's output with the same mapping filter and is trained for the mapped labels. Output of the trained CNN is then deconvolved to generate points as cell detection. We compare our method with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches where the results show that the proposed approach detects cells with comparatively high precision and F1-score. 
### 352.Repetition Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06984.pdf)
> Visual repetition is ubiquitous in our world. It appears in human activity (sports, cooking), animal behavior (a bee's waggle dance), natural phenomena (leaves in the wind) and in urban environments (flashing lights). Estimating visual repetition from realistic video is challenging as periodic motion is rarely perfectly static and stationary. To better deal with realistic video, we elevate the static and stationary assumptions often made by existing work. Our spatiotemporal filtering approach, established on the theory of periodic motion, effectively handles a wide variety of appearances and requires no learning. Starting from motion in 3D we derive three periodic motion types by decomposition of the motion field into its fundamental components. In addition, three temporal motion continuities emerge from the field's temporal dynamics. For the 2D perception of 3D motion we consider the viewpoint relative to the motion; what follows are 18 cases of recurrent motion perception. To estimate repetition under all circumstances, our theory implies constructing a mixture of differential motion maps: gradient, divergence and curl. We temporally convolve the motion maps with wavelet filters to estimate repetitive dynamics. Our method is able to spatially segment repetitive motion directly from the temporal filter responses densely computed over the motion maps. For experimental verification of our claims, we use our novel dataset for repetition estimation, better-reflecting reality with non-static and non-stationary repetitive motion. On the task of repetition counting, we obtain favorable results compared to a deep learning alternative. 
### 353.Classification of remote sensing images using attribute profiles and  feature profiles from different trees: a comparative study [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06985.pdf)
> The motivation of this paper is to conduct a comparative study on remote sensing image classification using the morphological attribute profiles (APs) and feature profiles (FPs) generated from different types of tree structures. Over the past few years, APs have been among the most effective methods to model the image's spatial and contextual information. Recently, a novel extension of APs called FPs has been proposed by replacing pixel gray-levels with some statistical and geometrical features when forming the output profiles. FPs have been proved to be more efficient than the standard APs when generated from component trees (max-tree and min-tree). In this work, we investigate their performance on the inclusion tree (tree of shapes) and partition trees (alpha tree and omega tree). Experimental results from both panchromatic and hyperspectral images again confirm the efficiency of FPs compared to APs. 
### 354.Soft Sampling for Robust Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06986.pdf)
> We study the robustness of object detection under the presence of missing annotations. In this setting, the unlabeled object instances will be treated as background, which will generate an incorrect training signal for the detector. Interestingly, we observe that after dropping 30% of the annotations (and labeling them as background), the performance of CNN-based object detectors like Faster-RCNN only drops by 5% on the PASCAL VOC dataset. We provide a detailed explanation for this result. To further bridge the performance gap, we propose a simple yet effective solution, called Soft Sampling. Soft Sampling re-weights the gradients of RoIs as a function of overlap with positive instances. This ensures that the uncertain background regions are given a smaller weight compared to the hardnegatives. Extensive experiments on curated PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Soft Sampling method at different annotation drop rates. Finally, we show that on OpenImagesV3, which is a real-world dataset with missing annotations, Soft Sampling outperforms standard detection baselines by over 3%. 
### 355.Fast Multiple Landmark Localisation Using a Patch-based Iterative  Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06987.pdf)
> We propose a new Patch-based Iterative Network (PIN) for fast and accurate landmark localisation in 3D medical volumes. PIN utilises a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn the spatial relationship between an image patch and anatomical landmark positions. During inference, patches are repeatedly passed to the CNN until the estimated landmark position converges to the true landmark location. PIN is computationally efficient since the inference stage only selectively samples a small number of patches in an iterative fashion rather than a dense sampling at every location in the volume. Our approach adopts a multi-task learning framework that combines regression and classification to improve localisation accuracy. We extend PIN to localise multiple landmarks by using principal component analysis, which models the global anatomical relationships between landmarks. We have evaluated PIN using 72 3D ultrasound images from fetal screening examinations. PIN achieves quantitatively an average landmark localisation error of 5.59mm and a runtime of 0.44s to predict 10 landmarks per volume. Qualitatively, anatomical 2D standard scan planes derived from the predicted landmark locations are visually similar to the clinical ground truth. 
### 356.VirtualHome: Simulating Household Activities via Programs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07011.pdf)
> In this paper, we are interested in modeling complex activities that occur in a typical household. We propose to use programs, i.e., sequences of atomic actions and interactions, as a high level representation of complex tasks. Programs are interesting because they provide a non-ambiguous representation of a task, and allow agents to execute them. However, nowadays, there is no database providing this type of information. Towards this goal, we first crowd-source programs for a variety of activities that happen in people's homes, via a game-like interface used for teaching kids how to code. Using the collected dataset, we show how we can learn to extract programs directly from natural language descriptions or from videos. We then implement the most common atomic (inter)actions in the Unity3D game engine, and use our programs to "drive" an artificial agent to execute tasks in a simulated household environment. Our VirtualHome simulator allows us to create a large activity video dataset with rich ground-truth, enabling training and testing of video understanding models. We further showcase examples of our agent performing tasks in our VirtualHome based on language descriptions. 
### 357.Deep neural network based sparse measurement matrix for image compressed  sensing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07026.pdf)
> Gaussian random matrix (GRM) has been widely used to generate linear measurements in compressed sensing (CS) of natural images. However, there actually exist two disadvantages with GRM in practice. One is that GRM has large memory requirement and high computational complexity, which restrict the applications of CS. Another is that the CS measurements randomly obtained by GRM cannot provide sufficient reconstruction performances. In this paper, a Deep neural network based Sparse Measurement Matrix (DSMM) is learned by the proposed convolutional network to reduce the sampling computational complexity and improve the CS reconstruction performance. Two sub networks are included in the proposed network, which are the sampling sub-network and the reconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, the sparsity and the normalization are both considered by the limitation of the storage and the computational complexity. In order to improve the CS reconstruction performance, a reconstruction sub-network are introduced to help enhance the sampling sub-network. So by the offline iterative training of the proposed end-to-end network, the DSMM is generated for accurate measurement and excellent reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DSMM outperforms GRM greatly on representative CS reconstruction methods 
### 358.MoE-SPNet: A Mixture-of-Experts Scene Parsing Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07049.pdf)
> Scene parsing is an indispensable component in understanding the semantics within a scene. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted local features and probabilistic graphical models to incorporate local and global cues. Recently, methods based on fully convolutional neural networks have achieved new records on scene parsing. An important strategy common to these methods is the aggregation of hierarchical features yielded by a deep convolutional neural network. However, typical algorithms usually aggregate hierarchical convolutional features via concatenation or linear combination, which cannot sufficiently exploit the diversities of contextual information in multi-scale features and the spatial inhomogeneity of a scene. In this paper, we propose a mixture-of-experts scene parsing network (MoE-SPNet) that incorporates a convolutional mixture-of-experts layer to assess the importance of features from different levels and at different spatial locations. In addition, we propose a variant of mixture-of-experts called the adaptive hierarchical feature aggregation (AHFA) mechanism which can be incorporated into existing scene parsing networks that use skip-connections to fuse features layer-wisely. In the proposed networks, different levels of features at each spatial location are adaptively re-weighted according to the local structure and surrounding contextual information before aggregation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on two scene parsing datasets including PASCAL VOC 2012 and SceneParse150 based on two kinds of baseline models FCN-8s and DeepLab-ASPP. 
### 359.Cancer Metastasis Detection With Neural Conditional Random Field [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07064.pdf)
> Breast cancer diagnosis often requires accurate detection of metastasis in lymph nodes through Whole-slide Images (WSIs). Recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant successes in medical image analysis and particularly in computational histopathology. Because of the outrageous large size of WSIs, most of the methods divide one slide into lots of small image patches and perform classification on each patch independently. However, neighboring patches often share spatial correlations, and ignoring these spatial correlations may result in inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose a neural conditional random field (NCRF) deep learning framework to detect cancer metastasis in WSIs. NCRF considers the spatial correlations between neighboring patches through a fully connected CRF which is directly incorporated on top of a CNN feature extractor. The whole deep network can be trained end-to-end with standard back-propagation algorithm with minor computational overhead from the CRF component. The CNN feature extractor can also benefit from considering spatial correlations via the CRF component. Compared to the baseline method without considering spatial correlations, we show that the proposed NCRF framework obtains probability maps of patch predictions with better visual quality. We also demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in cancer metastasis detection on the Camelyon16 dataset and achieves an average FROC score of 0.8096 on the test set. NCRF is open sourced at <a href="https://github.com/baidu-research/NCRF.">this https URL</a> 
### 360.A New COLD Feature based Handwriting Analysis for Ethnicity/Nationality  Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07072.pdf)
> Identifying crime for forensic investigating teams when crimes involve people of different nationals is challenging. This paper proposes a new method for ethnicity (nationality) identification based on Cloud of Line Distribution (COLD) features of handwriting components. The proposed method, at first, explores tangent angle for the contour pixels in each row and the mean of intensity values of each row in an image for segmenting text lines. For segmented text lines, we use tangent angle and direction of base lines to remove rule lines in the image. We use polygonal approximation for finding dominant points for contours of edge components. Then the proposed method connects the nearest dominant points of every dominant point, which results in line segments of dominant point pairs. For each line segment, the proposed method estimates angle and length, which gives a point in polar domain. For all the line segments, the proposed method generates dense points in polar domain, which results in COLD distribution. As character component shapes change, according to nationals, the shape of the distribution changes. This observation is extracted based on distance from pixels of distribution to Principal Axis of the distribution. Then the features are subjected to an SVM classifier for identifying nationals. Experiments are conducted on a complex dataset, which show the proposed method is effective and outperforms the existing method 
### 361.Learning to Update for Object Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07078.pdf)
> Model update lies at the heart of object tracking.Generally, model update is formulated as an online learning problem where a target model is learned over the online training dataset. Our key innovation is to \emph{learn the online learning algorithm itself using large number of offline videos}, i.e., \emph{learning to update}. The learned updater takes as input the online training dataset and outputs an updated target model. As a first attempt, we design the learned updater based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and demonstrate its application in a template-based tracker and a correlation filter-based tracker. Our learned updater consistently improves the base trackers and runs faster than realtime on GPU while requiring small memory footprint during testing. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our learned updater outperforms commonly used update baselines including the efficient exponential moving average (EMA)-based update and the well-designed stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based update. Equipped with our learned updater, the template-based tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance among realtime trackers on GPU. 
### 362.Diffeomorphic brain shape modelling using Gauss-Newton optimisation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07109.pdf)
> Shape modelling describes methods aimed at capturing the natural variability of shapes and commonly relies on probabilistic interpretations of dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis. Due to their computational complexity when dealing with dense deformation models such as diffeomorphisms, previous attempts have focused on explicitly reducing their dimension, diminishing de facto their flexibility and ability to model complex shapes such as brains. In this paper, we present a generative model of shape that allows the covariance structure of deformations to be captured without squashing their domain, resulting in better normalisation. An efficient inference scheme based on Gauss-Newton optimisation is used, which enables processing of 3D neuroimaging data. We trained this algorithm on segmented brains from the OASIS database, generating physiologically meaningful deformation trajectories. To prove the model's robustness, we applied it to unseen data, which resulted in equivalent fitting scores. 
### 363.Modality Distillation with Multiple Stream Networks for Action  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07110.pdf)
> Diverse input data modalities can provide complementary cues for several tasks, usually leading to more robust algorithms and better performance. However, while a (training) dataset could be accurately designed to include a variety of sensory inputs, it is often the case that not all modalities could be available in real life (testing) scenarios, where a model has to be deployed. This raises the challenge of how to learn robust representations leveraging multimodal data in the training stage, while considering limitations at test time, such as noisy or missing modalities. <br />This paper presents a new approach for multimodal video action recognition, developed within the unified frameworks of distillation and privileged information, named generalized distillation. Particularly, we consider the case of learning representations from depth and RGB videos, while relying on RGB data only at test time. We propose a new approach to train an hallucination network that learns to distill depth features through multiplicative connections of spatiotemporal representations, leveraging soft labels and hard labels, as well as distance between feature maps. We report state-of-the-art results on video action classification on the largest multimodal dataset available for this task, the NTU RGB+D. 
### 364.Infrared and Visible Image Fusion with ResNet and zero-phase component  analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07119.pdf)
> Feature extraction and processing are key tasks in the Image fusion algorithm, while most of deep learning-based methods use deep features directly without feature processing. This leads to the fusion performance degradation in some cases. To solve this drawback, in this paper, a novel fusion framework based on deep features and zero-phase component analysis (ZCA) is proposed. Firstly, the residual network (ResNet) is used to extract deep features from source images. Then ZCA and l_1-norm are utilized to normalize the deep features and obtain initial weight maps. The final weight maps are obtained by employing a soft-max operation in association with the initial weight maps. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed using a weighted-averaging strategy. Compared with the existing fusion methods, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance in both objective assessment and visual quality. The code of our fusion algorithm is available at <a href="https://github.com/exceptionLi/imagefusion_resnet50">this https URL</a> 
### 365.FineTag: Multi-label Retrieval of Attributes at Fine-grained Level in  Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07124.pdf)
> In image retrieval, the features extracted from an item are used to look for similar lookalike of the items (e.g. finding a match for a bag in a retail catalogue). Identifying all the attributes of a single instance of an item in an image (e.g. the shape of the bag) could facilitate the task of image retrieval. In this work, we introduce a simple end-to-end architecture for retrieving the attributes at a fine-grained level in an image. 
### 366.Feature learning based on visual similarity triplets in medical image  analysis: A case study of emphysema in chest CT scans [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07131.pdf)
> Supervised feature learning using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can provide concise and disease relevant representations of medical images. However, training CNNs requires annotated image data. Annotating medical images can be a time-consuming task and even expert annotations are subject to substantial inter- and intra-rater variability. Assessing visual similarity of images instead of indicating specific pathologies or estimating disease severity could allow non-experts to participate, help uncover new patterns, and possibly reduce rater variability. We consider the task of assessing emphysema extent in chest CT scans. We derive visual similarity triplets from visually assessed emphysema extent and learn a low dimensional embedding using CNNs. We evaluate the networks on 973 images, and show that the CNNs can learn disease relevant feature representations from derived similarity triplets. To our knowledge this is the first medical image application where similarity triplets has been used to learn a feature representation that can be used for embedding unseen test images 
### 367.Automatic segmentation of prostate zones [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07146.pdf)
> Convolutional networks have become state-of-the-art techniques for automatic medical image analysis, with the U-net architecture being the most popular at this moment. In this article we report the application of a 3D version of U-net to the automatic segmentation of prostate peripheral and transition zones in 3D MRI images. Our results are slightly better than recent studies that used 2D U-net and handcrafted feature approaches. <br />In addition, we test ideas for improving the 3D U-net setup, by 1) letting the network segment surrounding tissues, making use of the fixed anatomy, and 2) adjusting the network architecture to reflect the anisotropy in the dimensions of the MRI image volumes. While the latter adjustment gave a marginal improvement, the former adjustment showed a significant deterioration of the network performance. We were able to explain this deterioration by inspecting feature map activations in all layers of the network. We show that to segment more tissues the network replaces feature maps that were dedicated to detecting prostate peripheral zones, by feature maps detecting the surrounding tissues. 
### 368.Semi-supervised Hashing for Semi-Paired Cross-View Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07155.pdf)
> Recently, hashing techniques have gained importance in large-scale retrieval tasks because of their retrieval speed. Most of the existing cross-view frameworks assume that data are well paired. However, the fully-paired multiview situation is not universal in real applications. The aim of the method proposed in this paper is to learn the hashing function for semi-paired cross-view retrieval tasks. To utilize the label information of partial data, we propose a semi-supervised hashing learning framework which jointly performs feature extraction and classifier learning. The experimental results on two datasets show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy. 
### 369.Non-deterministic Behavior of Ranking-based Metrics when Evaluating  Embeddings [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07171.pdf)
> Embedding data into vector spaces is a very popular strategy of pattern recognition methods. When distances between embeddings are quantized, performance metrics become ambiguous. In this paper, we present an analysis of the ambiguity quantized distances introduce and provide bounds on the effect. We demonstrate that it can have a measurable effect in empirical data in state-of-the-art systems. We also approach the phenomenon from a computer security perspective and demonstrate how someone being evaluated by a third party can exploit this ambiguity and greatly outperform a random predictor without even access to the input data. We also suggest a simple solution making the performance metrics, which rely on ranking, totally deterministic and impervious to such exploits. 
### 370.Task Driven Generative Modeling for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation:  Application to X-ray Image Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07201.pdf)
> Automatic parsing of anatomical objects in X-ray images is critical to many clinical applications in particular towards image-guided invention and workflow automation. Existing deep network models require a large amount of labeled data. However, obtaining accurate pixel-wise labeling in X-ray images relies heavily on skilled clinicians due to the large overlaps of anatomy and the complex texture patterns. On the other hand, organs in 3D CT scans preserve clearer structures as well as sharper boundaries and thus can be easily delineated. In this paper, we propose a novel model framework for learning automatic X-ray image parsing from labeled CT scans. Specifically, a Dense Image-to-Image network (DI2I) for multi-organ segmentation is first trained on X-ray like Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) rendered from 3D CT volumes. Then we introduce a Task Driven Generative Adversarial Network (TD-GAN) architecture to achieve simultaneous style transfer and parsing for unseen real X-ray images. TD-GAN consists of a modified cycle-GAN substructure for pixel-to-pixel translation between DRRs and X-ray images and an added module leveraging the pre-trained DI2I to enforce segmentation consistency. The TD-GAN framework is general and can be easily adapted to other learning tasks. In the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on 815 DRRs and 153 topograms. While the vanilla DI2I without any adaptation fails completely on segmenting the topograms, the proposed model does not require any topogram labels and is able to provide a promising average dice of 85% which achieves the same level accuracy of supervised training (88%). 
### 371.An optimized system to solve text-based CAPTCHA [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07202.pdf)
> CAPTCHA(Completely Automated Public Turing test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) can be used to protect data from auto bots. Countless kinds of CAPTCHAs are thus designed, while we most frequently utilize text-based scheme because of most convenience and user-friendly way \cite{bursztein2011text}. Currently, various types of CAPTCHAs need corresponding segmentation to identify single character due to the numerous different segmentation ways. Our goal is to defeat the CAPTCHA, thus firstly the CAPTCHAs need to be split into character by character. There isn't a regular segmentation algorithm to obtain the divided characters in all kinds of examples, which means that we have to treat the segmentation individually. In this paper, we build a whole system to defeat the CAPTCHAs as well as achieve state-of-the-art performance. In detail, we present our self-adaptive algorithm to segment different kinds of characters optimally, and then utilize both the existing methods and our own constructed convolutional neural network as an extra classifier. Results are provided showing how our system work well towards defeating these CAPTCHAs. 
### 372.DFNet: Semantic Segmentation on Panoramic Images with Dynamic Loss  Weights and Residual Fusion Block [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07226.pdf)
> For the self-driving and automatic parking, perception is the basic and critical technique, moreover, the detection of lane markings and parking slots is an important part of visual perception. In this paper, we use the semantic segmentation method to segment the area and classify the class of lane makings and parking slots on panoramic surround view (PSV) dataset. We propose the DFNet and make two main contributions, one is dynamic loss weights, and the other is residual fusion block (RFB). Dynamic loss weights are varying from classes, calculated according to the pixel number of each class in a batch. RFB is composed of two convolutional layers, one pooling layer, and a fusion layer to combine the feature maps by pixel multiplication. We evaluate our method on PSV dataset, and achieve an advanced result. 
### 373.A Graph Transduction Game for Multi-target Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07227.pdf)
> Semi-supervised learning is a popular class of techniques to learn from labeled and unlabeled data. The paper proposes an application of a recently proposed approach of graph transduction that exploits game theoretic notions to the problem of multiple people tracking. Within the proposed framework, targets are considered as players of a multi-player non-cooperative game. The equilibria of the game is considered as a consistent labeling solution and thus an estimation of the target association in the sequence of frames. Patches of persons are extracted from the video frames using a HOG based detector and their similarity is modeled using distances among their covariance matrices. The solution we propose achieves satisfactory results on video surveillance datasets. The experiments show the robustness of the method even with a heavy unbalance between the number of labeled and unlabeled input patches. 
### 374.Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Quantification using Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07237.pdf)
> Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an important technique in biomedical research and it has the unique capability to give a non-invasive access to the biochemical content (metabolites) of scanned organs. In the literature, the quantification (the extraction of the potential biomarkers from the MRS signals) involves the resolution of an inverse problem based on a parametric model of the metabolite signal. However, poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), presence of the macromolecule signal or high correlation between metabolite spectral patterns can cause high uncertainties for most of the metabolites, which is one of the main reasons that prevents use of MRS in clinical routine. In this paper, quantification of metabolites in MR Spectroscopic imaging using deep learning is proposed. A regression framework based on the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is introduced for an accurate estimation of spectral parameters. The proposed model learns the spectral features from a large-scale simulated data set with different variations of human brain spectra and SNRs. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method, compared to state of the art standard quantification method (QUEST), on concentration of 20 metabolites and the macromolecule. 
### 375.Learning Conditioned Graph Structures for Interpretable Visual Question  Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07243.pdf)
> Visual Question answering is a challenging problem requiring a combination of concepts from Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Most existing approaches use a two streams strategy, computing image and question features that are consequently merged using a variety of techniques. Nonetheless, very few rely on higher level image representations, which allow to capture semantic and spatial relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based approach for Visual Question Answering. Our method combines a graph learner module, which learns a question specific graph representation of the input image, with the recent concept of graph convolutions, aiming to learn image representations that capture question specific interactions. We test our approach on the VQA v2 dataset using a simple baseline architecture enhanced by the proposed graph learner module. We obtain state of the art results with 66.18% accuracy and demonstrate the interpretability of the proposed method. 
### 376.Unsupervised Deep Multi-focus Image Fusion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07272.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks have recently been used for multi-focus image fusion. However, due to the lack of labeled data for supervised training of such networks, existing methods have resorted to adding Gaussian blur in focused images to simulate defocus and generate synthetic training data with ground-truth for supervised learning. Moreover, they classify pixels as focused or defocused and leverage the results to construct the fusion weight maps which then necessitates a series of post-processing steps. In this paper, we present unsupervised end-to-end learning for directly predicting the fully focused output image from multi-focus input image pairs. The proposed approach uses a novel CNN architecture trained to perform fusion without the need for ground truth fused images and exploits the image structural similarity (SSIM) to calculate the loss; a metric that is widely accepted for fused image quality evaluation. Consequently, we are able to utilize {\em real} benchmark datasets, instead of simulated ones, to train our network. The model is a feed-forward, fully convolutional neural network that can process images of variable sizes during test time. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art in terms of visual quality and objective evaluations. 
### 377.Constructing Fast Network through Deconstruction of Convolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07370.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks have achieved great success in various vision tasks; however, they incur heavy resource costs. By using deeper and wider networks, network accuracy can be improved rapidly. However, in an environment with limited resources (e.g., mobile applications), heavy networks may not be usable. This study shows that naive convolution can be deconstructed into a shift operation and pointwise convolution. To cope with various convolutions, we propose a new shift operation called active shift layer (ASL) that formulates the amount of shift as a learnable function with shift parameters. This new layer can be optimized end-to-end through backpropagation and it can provide optimal shift values. Finally, we apply this layer to a light and fast network that surpasses existing state-of-the-art networks. 
### 378.Object-Oriented Dynamics Predictor [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07371.pdf)
> Generalization has been one of the major challenges for learning dynamics models in model-based reinforcement learning. However, previous work on action-conditioned dynamics prediction focuses on learning the pixel-level motion and thus does not generalize well to novel environments with different object layouts. In this paper, we present a novel object-oriented framework, called object-oriented dynamics predictor (OODP), which decomposes the environment into objects and predicts the dynamics of objects conditioned on both actions and object-to-object relations. It is an end-to-end neural network and can be trained in an unsupervised manner. To enable the generalization ability of dynamics learning, we design a novel CNN-based relation mechanism that is class-specific (rather than object-specific) and exploits the locality principle. Empirical results show that OODP significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of generalization over novel environments with various object layouts. OODP is able to learn from very few environments and accurately predict dynamics in a large number of unseen environments. In addition, OODP learns semantically and visually interpretable dynamics models. 
### 379.Learning Unit State Recognition Based on Multi-channel Data Fusion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07372.pdf)
> Despite recent advances in MOOC, the current e-learning systems have advantages of alleviating barriers by time differences, and geographically spatial separation between teachers and students. However, there has been a 'lack of supervision' problem that e-learner's learning unit state(LUS) can't be supervised automatically. In this paper, we present a fusion framework considering three channel data sources: 1) videos/images from a camera, 2) eye movement information tracked by a low solution eye tracker and 3) mouse movement. Based on these data modalities, we propose a novel approach of multi-channel data fusion to explore the learning unit state recognition. We also propose a method to build a learning state recognition model to avoid manually labeling image data. The experiments were carried on our designed online learning prototype system, and we choose CART, Random Forest and GBDT regression model to predict e-learner's learning state. The results show that multi-channel data fusion model have a better recognition performance in comparison with single channel model. In addition, a best recognition performance can be reached when image, eye movement and mouse movement features are fused. 
### 380.Few-Shot Segmentation Propagation with Guided Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07373.pdf)
> Learning-based methods for visual segmentation have made progress on particular types of segmentation tasks, but are limited by the necessary supervision, the narrow definitions of fixed tasks, and the lack of control during inference for correcting errors. To remedy the rigidity and annotation burden of standard approaches, we address the problem of few-shot segmentation: given few image and few pixel supervision, segment any images accordingly. We propose guided networks, which extract a latent task representation from any amount of supervision, and optimize our architecture end-to-end for fast, accurate few-shot segmentation. Our method can switch tasks without further optimization and quickly update when given more guidance. We report the first results for segmentation from one pixel per concept and show real-time interactive video segmentation. Our unified approach propagates pixel annotations across space for interactive segmentation, across time for video segmentation, and across scenes for semantic segmentation. Our guided segmentor is state-of-the-art in accuracy for the amount of annotation and time. See <a href="http://github.com/shelhamer/revolver">this http URL</a> for code, models, and more details. 
### 381.Multilingual Scene Character Recognition System using Sparse  Auto-Encoder for Efficient Local Features Representation in Bag of Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07374.pdf)
> The recognition of texts existing in camera-captured images has become an important issue for a great deal of research during the past few decades. This give birth to Scene Character Recognition (SCR) which is an important step in scene text recognition pipeline. In this paper, we extended the Bag of Features (BoF)-based model using deep learning for representing features for accurate SCR of different languages. In the features coding step, a deep Sparse Auto-encoder (SAE)-based strategy was applied to enhance the representative and discriminative abilities of image features. This deep learning architecture provides more efficient features representation and therefore a better recognition accuracy. Our system was evaluated extensively on all the scene character datasets of five different languages. The experimental results proved the efficiency of our system for a multilingual SCR. 
### 382.Distinguishing Refracted Features using Light Field Cameras with  Application to Structure from Motion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07375.pdf)
> Robots must reliably interact with refractive objects in many applications; however, refractive objects can cause many robotic vision algorithms to become unreliable or even fail, particularly feature-based matching applications, such as structure-from-motion. We propose a method to distinguish between refracted and Lambertian image features using a light field camera. Specifically, we propose to use textural cross-correlation to characterise apparent feature motion in a single light field, and compare this motion to its Lambertian equivalent based on 4D light field geometry. Our refracted feature distinguisher has a 34.3% higher rate of detection compared to state-of-the-art for light fields captured with large baselines relative to the refractive object. Our method also applies to light field cameras with much smaller baselines than previously considered, yielding up to 2 times better detection for 2D-refractive objects, such as a sphere, and up to 8 times better for 1D-refractive objects, such as a cylinder. For structure from motion, we demonstrate that rejecting refracted features using our distinguisher yields up to 42.4% lower reprojection error, and lower failure rate when the robot is approaching refractive objects. Our method lead to more robust robot vision in the presence of refractive objects. 
### 383.Semantic Analysis of (Reflectional) Visual Symmetry: A Human-Centred  Computational Model for Declarative Explainability [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07376.pdf)
> We present a computational framework for the semantic interpretation of symmetry in naturalistic scenes. Key features include a human-centred representation, and a declarative, explainable interpretation model supporting deep semantic question-answering founded on an integration of methods in knowledge representation and computer vision. In the backdrop of the visual arts, we showcase the framework's capability to generate human-centred, queryable, relational structures, also evaluating the framework with an empirical study on the human perception of visual symmetry. Our framework represents and is driven by the application of foundational Vision and KR methods in the psychological and social sciences. 
### 384.Transfer Learning for Related Reinforcement Learning Tasks via  Image-to-Image Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07377.pdf)
> Deep Reinforcement Learning has managed to achieve state-of-the-art results in learning control policies directly from raw pixels. However, despite its remarkable success, it fails to generalize, a fundamental component required in a stable Artificial Intelligence system. Using the Atari game Breakout, we demonstrate the difficulty of a trained agent in adjusting to simple modifications in the raw image, ones that a human could adapt to trivially. In transfer learning, the goal is to use the knowledge gained from the source task to make the training of the target task faster and better. We show that using various forms of fine-tuning, a common method for transfer learning, is not effective for adapting to such small visual changes. In fact, it is often easier to re-train the agent from scratch than to fine-tune a trained agent. We suggest that in some cases transfer learning can be improved by adding a dedicated component whose goal is to learn to visually map between the known domain and the new one. Concretely, we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create a mapping function to translate images in the target task to corresponding images in the source task, allowing us to transform between the different tasks. We show that learning this mapping is substantially more efficient than re-training. A visualization of a trained agent playing in a modified condition, with and without the GAN transfer, can be seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/e2TwjduPT8g">this https URL</a> . 
### 385.Localizing and Quantifying Damage in Social Media Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07378.pdf)
> Traditional post-disaster assessment of damage heavily relies on expensive GIS data, especially remote sensing image data. In recent years, social media has become a rich source of disaster information that may be useful in assessing damage at a lower cost. Such information includes text (e.g., tweets) or images posted by eyewitnesses of a disaster. Most of the existing research explores the use of text in identifying situational awareness information useful for disaster response teams. The use of social media images to assess disaster damage is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, based on convolutional neural networks and class activation maps, to locate damage in a disaster image and to quantify the degree of the damage. Our proposed approach enables the use of social network images for post-disaster damage assessment and provides an inexpensive and feasible alternative to the more expensive GIS approach. 
### 386.DeepTerramechanics: Terrain Classification and Slip Estimation for  Ground Robots via Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07379.pdf)
> Terramechanics plays a critical role in the areas of ground vehicles and ground mobile robots since understanding and estimating the variables influencing the vehicle-terrain interaction may mean the success or the failure of an entire mission. This research applies state-of-the-art algorithms in deep learning to two key problems: estimating wheel slip and classifying the terrain being traversed by a ground robot. Three data sets collected by ground robotic platforms (MIT single-wheel testbed, MSL Curiosity rover, and tracked robot Fitorobot) are employed in order to compare the performance of traditional machine learning methods (i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)) against Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This work also shows the impact that certain tuning parameters and the network architecture (MLP, DNN and CNN) play on the performance of those methods. This paper also contributes a deep discussion with the lessons learned in the implementation of DNNs and CNNs and how these methods can be extended to solve other problems. 
### 387.Deep Sequence Learning with Auxiliary Information for Traffic Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07380.pdf)
> Predicting traffic conditions from online route queries is a challenging task as there are many complicated interactions over the roads and crowds involved. In this paper, we intend to improve traffic prediction by appropriate integration of three kinds of implicit but essential factors encoded in auxiliary information. We do this within an encoder-decoder sequence learning framework that integrates the following data: 1) offline geographical and social attributes. For example, the geographical structure of roads or public social events such as national celebrations; 2) road intersection information. In general, traffic congestion occurs at major junctions; 3) online crowd queries. For example, when many online queries issued for the same destination due to a public performance, the traffic around the destination will potentially become heavier at this location after a while. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on a real-world dataset from Baidu have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework. 
### 388.G2D: from GTA to Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07381.pdf)
> This document describes G2D, a software that enables capturing videos from Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), a popular role playing game set in an expansive virtual city. The target users of our software are computer vision researchers who wish to collect hyper-realistic computer-generated imagery of a city from the street level, under controlled 6DOF camera poses and varying environmental conditions (weather, season, time of day, traffic density, etc.). <br />G2D accesses/calls the native functions of the game; hence users can directly interact with G2D while playing the game. Specifically, G2D enables users to manipulate conditions of the virtual environment on the fly, while the gameplay camera is set to automatically retrace a predetermined 6DOF camera pose trajectory within the game coordinate system. Concurrently, automatic screen capture is executed while the virtual environment is being explored. G2D and its source code are publicly available at <a href="https://goo.gl/SS7fS6">this https URL</a> <br />In addition, we demonstrate an application of G2D to generate a large-scale dataset with groundtruth camera poses for testing structure-from-motion (SfM) algorithms. The dataset and generated 3D point clouds are also made available at <a href="https://goo.gl/DNzxHx">this https URL</a> 
### 389.In situ TensorView: In situ Visualization of Convolutional Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07382.pdf)
> Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) are complex systems. They are trained so they can adapt their internal connections to recognize images, texts and more. It is both interesting and helpful to visualize the dynamics within such deep artificial neural networks so that people can understand how these artificial networks are learning and making predictions. In the field of scientific simulations, visualization tools like Paraview have long been utilized to provide insights and understandings. We present in situ TensorView to visualize the training and functioning of CNNs as if they are systems of scientific simulations. In situ TensorView is a loosely coupled in situ visualization open framework that provides multiple viewers to help users to visualize and understand their networks. It leverages the capability of co-processing from Paraview to provide real-time visualization during training and predicting phases. This avoid heavy I/O overhead for visualizing large dynamic systems. Only a small number of lines of codes are injected in TensorFlow framework. The visualization can provide guidance to adjust the architecture of networks, or compress the pre-trained networks. We showcase visualizing the training of LeNet-5 and VGG16 using in situ TensorView. 
### 390.Two Stream Self-Supervised Learning for Action Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07383.pdf)
> We present a self-supervised approach using spatio-temporal signals between video frames for action recognition. A two-stream architecture is leveraged to tangle spatial and temporal representation learning. Our task is formulated as both a sequence verification and spatio-temporal alignment tasks. The former task requires motion temporal structure understanding while the latter couples the learned motion with the spatial representation. The self-supervised pre-trained weights effectiveness is validated on the action recognition task. Quantitative evaluation shows the self-supervised approach competence on three datasets: HMDB51, UCF101, and Honda driving dataset (HDD). Further investigations to boost performance and generalize validity are still required. 
### 391.Built-in Vulnerabilities to Imperceptible Adversarial Perturbations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07409.pdf)
> Designing models that are robust to small adversarial perturbations of their inputs has proven remarkably difficult. In this work we show that the reverse problem---making models more vulnerable---is surprisingly easy. After presenting some proofs of concept on MNIST, we introduce a generic tilting attack that injects vulnerabilities into the linear layers of pre-trained networks without affecting their performance on natural data. We illustrate this attack on a multilayer perceptron trained on SVHN and use it to design a stand-alone adversarial module which we call a steganogram decoder. Finally, we show on CIFAR-10 that a state-of-the-art network can be trained to misclassify images in the presence of imperceptible backdoor signals. These different results suggest that adversarial perturbations are not always informative of the true features used by a model. 
### 392.Fast CapsNet for Lung Cancer Screening [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07416.pdf)
> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the past several years. A major challenge in lung cancer screening is the detection of lung nodules from computed tomography (CT) scans. State-of-the-art approaches in automated lung nodule classification use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, these networks require a large number of training samples to generalize well. This paper investigates the use of capsule networks (CapsNets) as an alternative to CNNs. We show that CapsNets significantly outperforms CNNs when the number of training samples is small. To increase the computational efficiency, our paper proposes a consistent dynamic routing mechanism that results in $3\times$ speedup of CapsNet. Finally, we show that the original image reconstruction method of CapNets performs poorly on lung nodule data. We propose an efficient alternative, called convolutional decoder, that yields lower reconstruction error and higher classification accuracy. 
### 393.Improved Image Selection for Stack-Based HDR Imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07420.pdf)
> Stack-based high dynamic range (HDR) imaging is a technique for achieving a larger dynamic range in an image by combining several low dynamic range images acquired at different exposures. Minimizing the set of images to combine, while ensuring that the resulting HDR image fully captures the scene's irradiance, is important to avoid long image acquisition and post-processing times. The problem of selecting the set of images has received much attention. However, existing methods either are not fully automatic, can be slow, or can fail to fully capture more challenging scenes. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic method for selecting the set of exposures to acquire that is both fast and more accurate. We show on an extensive set of benchmark scenes that our proposed method leads to improved HDR images as measured against ground truth using the mean squared error, a pixel-based metric, and a visible difference predictor and a quality score, both perception-based metrics. 
### 394.RISE: Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation of Black-box Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07421.pdf)
> Deep neural networks are being used increasingly to automate data analysis and decision making, yet their decision-making process is largely unclear and is difficult to explain to the end users. In this paper, we address the problem of Explainable AI for deep neural networks that take images as input and output a class probability. We propose an approach called RISE that generates an importance map indicating how salient each pixel is for the model's prediction. In contrast to white-box approaches that estimate pixel importance using gradients or other internal network state, RISE works on black-box models. It estimates importance empirically by probing the model with randomly masked versions of the input image and obtaining the corresponding outputs. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art importance extraction methods using both an automatic deletion/insertion metric and a pointing metric based on human-annotated object segments. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our approach matches or exceeds the performance of other methods, including white-box approaches. 
### 395.Standard Plane Detection in 3D Fetal Ultrasound Using an Iterative  Transformation Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07486.pdf)
> Standard scan plane detection in fetal brain ultrasound (US) forms a crucial step in the assessment of fetal development. In clinical settings, this is done by manually manoeuvring a 2D probe to the desired scan plane. With the advent of 3D US, the entire fetal brain volume containing these standard planes can be easily acquired. However, manual standard plane identification in 3D volume is labour-intensive and requires expert knowledge of fetal anatomy. We propose a new Iterative Transformation Network (ITN) for the automatic detection of standard planes in 3D volumes. ITN uses a convolutional neural network to learn the relationship between a 2D plane image and the transformation parameters required to move that plane towards the location/orientation of the standard plane in the 3D volume. During inference, the current plane image is passed iteratively to the network until it converges to the standard plane location. We explore the effect of using different transformation representations as regression outputs of ITN. Under a multi-task learning framework, we introduce additional classification probability outputs to the network to act as confidence measures for the regressed transformation parameters in order to further improve the localisation accuracy. When evaluated on 72 US volumes of fetal brain, our method achieves an error of 3.83mm/12.7 degrees and 3.80mm/12.6 degrees for the transventricular and transcerebellar planes respectively and takes 0.46s per plane. 
### 396.Towards the identification of Parkinson&#x27;s Disease using only T1 MR  Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07489.pdf)
> Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most common types of neurological diseases caused by progressive degeneration of dopamin- ergic neurons in the brain. Even though there is no fixed cure for this neurodegenerative disease, earlier diagnosis followed by earlier treatment can help patients have a better quality of life. Magnetic Resonance Imag- ing (MRI) has been one of the most popular diagnostic tool in recent years because it avoids harmful radiations. In this paper, we investi- gate the plausibility of using MRIs for automatically diagnosing PD. Our proposed method has three main steps : 1) Preprocessing, 2) Fea- ture Extraction, and 3) Classification. The FreeSurfer library is used for the first and the second steps. For classification, three main types of classifiers, including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are applied and their classification abil- ity is compared. The Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data set is used to evaluate the proposed method. The proposed system prove to be promising in assisting the diagnosis of PD. 
### 397.Myocardial Segmentation of Contrast Echocardiograms Using Random Forests  Guided by Shape Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07490.pdf)
> Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE) with micro-bubble contrast agent enables myocardial perfusion quantification which is invaluable for the early detection of coronary artery diseases. In this paper, we proposed a new segmentation method called Shape Model guided Random Forests (SMRF) for the analysis of MCE data. The proposed method utilizes a statistical shape model of the myocardium to guide the Random Forest (RF) segmentation in two ways. First, we introduce a novel Shape Model (SM) feature which captures the global structure and shape of the myocardium to produce a more accurate RF probability map. Second, the shape model is fitted to the RF probability map to further refine and constrain the final segmentation to plausible myocardial shapes. Evaluated on clinical MCE images from 15 patients, our method obtained promising results (Dice=0.81, Jaccard=0.70, MAD=1.68 mm, HD=6.53 mm) and showed a notable improvement in segmentation accuracy over the classic RF and its variants. 
### 398.On the Learning of Deep Local Features for Robust Face Spoofing  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07492.pdf)
> Biometrics emerged as a robust solution for security systems. However, given the widespread of biometric applications, criminals are developing techniques to circumvent them by simulating physical or behavioral traits of legal users (spoofing attacks). Despite face being a promising characteristic due to its universality, acceptability and presence of cameras almost everywhere, face recognition systems are extremely vulnerable to such frauds since they can be easily fooled with common printed facial photographs. State-of-the-art approaches, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), present good results in face spoofing detection. However, these methods do not exploit the importance of learning deep local features from each facial region, even though it is known from face recognition that different face regions have much different visual aspects, that can also be exploited for face spoofing detection. In this work we propose a novel CNN architecture trained in two steps for such task. Initially, each part of the neural network learns features from a given facial region. After, the whole model is fine-tuned on the whole facial images. Results show that such pretraining step allows the CNN to learn different local spoofing cues, improving the performance and convergence speed of the final model, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 399.Fully Automatic Myocardial Segmentation of Contrast Echocardiography  Sequence Using Random Forests Guided by Shape Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07497.pdf)
> Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is an imaging technique that assesses left ventricle function and myocardial perfusion for the detection of coronary artery diseases. Automatic MCE perfusion quantification is challenging and requires accurate segmentation of the myocardium from noisy and time-varying images. Random forests (RF) have been successfully applied to many medical image segmentation tasks. However, the pixel-wise RF classifier ignores contextual relationships between label outputs of individual pixels. RF which only utilizes local appearance features is also susceptible to data suffering from large intensity variations. In this paper, we demonstrate how to overcome the above limitations of classic RF by presenting a fully automatic segmentation pipeline for myocardial segmentation in full-cycle 2D MCE data. Specifically, a statistical shape model is used to provide shape prior information that guide the RF segmentation in two ways. First, a novel shape model (SM) feature is incorporated into the RF framework to generate a more accurate RF probability map. Second, the shape model is fitted to the RF probability map to refine and constrain the final segmentation to plausible myocardial shapes. We further improve the performance by introducing a bounding box detection algorithm as a preprocessing step in the segmentation pipeline. Our approach on 2D image is further extended to 2D+t sequence which ensures temporal consistency in the resultant sequence segmentations. When evaluated on clinical MCE data, our proposed method achieves notable improvement in segmentation accuracy and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods including the classic RF and its variants, active shape model and image registration. 
### 400.Fluid Annotation: A Human-Machine Collaboration Interface for Full Image  Annotation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07527.pdf)
> We introduce Fluid Annotation, an intuitive human-machine collaboration interface for annotating the class label and outline of every object and background region in an image. Fluid annotation is based on three principles: (I) Strong Machine-Learning aid. We start from the output of a strong neural network model, which the annotator can edit by correcting the labels of existing regions, adding new regions to cover missing objects, and removing incorrect regions. The edit operations are also assisted by the model. (II) Full image annotation in a single pass. As opposed to performing a series of small annotation tasks in isolation, we propose a unified interface for full image annotation in a single pass. (III) Empower the annotator. We empower the annotator to choose what to annotate and in which order. This enables concentrating on what the machine does not already know, i.e. putting human effort only on the errors it made. This helps using the annotation budget effectively. Through extensive experiments on the COCO+Stuff dataset, we demonstrate that Fluid Annotation leads to accurate annotations very efficiently, taking three times less annotation time than the popular LabelMe interface. 
### 401.Automatic detection of lumen and media in the IVUS images using U-Net  with VGG16 Encoder [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07554.pdf)
> Coronary heart disease is one of the top rank leading cause of mortality in the world which can be because of plaque burden inside the arteries. Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) has been recognized as power- ful imaging technology which captures the real time and high resolution images of the coronary arteries and can be used for the analysis of these plaques. The IVUS segmentation involves the extraction of two arterial walls components namely, lumen and media. In this paper, we investi- gate the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks including U-Net to segment ultrasound scans of arteries. In particular, the proposed seg- mentation network was built based on the the U-Net with the VGG16 encoder. Experiments were done for evaluating the proposed segmen- tation architecture which show promising quantitative and qualitative results. 
### 402.Weighted Hausdorff Distance: A Loss Function For Object Localization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07564.pdf)
> Recent advances in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved remarkable results in localizing objects in images. In these networks, the training procedure usually requires providing bounding boxes or the maximum number of expected objects. In this paper, we address the task of estimating object locations without annotated bounding boxes, which are typically hand-drawn and time consuming to label. We propose a loss function that can be used in any Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to estimate object locations. This loss function is a modification of the Average Hausdorff Distance between two unordered sets of points. The proposed method does not require one to "guess" the maximum number of objects in the image, and has no notion of bounding boxes, region proposals, or sliding windows. We evaluate our method with three datasets designed to locate people's heads, pupil centers and plant centers. We report an average precision and recall of 94% for the three datasets, and an average location error of 6 pixels in 256x256 images. 
### 403.Classifying Object Manipulation Actions based on Grasp-types and  Motion-Constraints [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07574.pdf)
> In this work, we address a challenging problem of fine-grained and coarse-grained recognition of object manipulation actions. Due to the variations in geometrical and motion constraints, there are different manipulations actions possible to perform different sets of actions with an object. Also, there are subtle movements involved to complete most of object manipulation actions. This makes the task of object manipulation action recognition difficult with only just the motion information. We propose to use grasp and motion-constraints information to recognise and understand action intention with different objects. We also provide an extensive experimental evaluation on the recent Yale Human Grasping dataset consisting of large set of 455 manipulation actions. The evaluation involves a) Different contemporary multi-class classifiers, and binary classifiers with one-vs-one multi- class voting scheme, b) Differential comparisons results based on subsets of attributes involving information of grasp and motion-constraints, c) Fine-grained and Coarse-grained object manipulation action recognition based on fine-grained as well as coarse-grained grasp type information, and d) Comparison between Instance level and Sequence level modeling of object manipulation actions. Our results justifies the efficacy of grasp attributes for the task of fine-grained and coarse-grained object manipulation action recognition. 
### 404.A CADe System for Gliomas in Brain MRI using Convolutional Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07589.pdf)
> Inspired by the success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we develop a novel Computer Aided Detection (CADe) system using CNN for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) detection and segmentation from multi channel MRI data. A two-stage approach first identifies the presence of GBM. This is followed by a GBM localization in each "abnormal" MR slice. As part of the CADe system, two CNN architectures viz. Classification CNN (C-CNN) and Detection CNN (D-CNN) are employed. The CADe system considers MRI data consisting of four sequences ($T_1$, $T_{1c},$ $T_2$, and $T_{2FLAIR}$) as input, and automatically generates the bounding boxes encompassing the tumor regions in each slice which is deemed abnormal. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CADe system, when used as a preliminary step before segmentation, can allow improved delineation of tumor region while reducing false positives arising in normal areas of the brain. The GrowCut method, employed for tumor segmentation, typically requires a foreground and background seed region for initialization. Here the algorithm is initialized with seeds automatically generated from the output of the proposed CADe system, thereby resulting in improved performance as compared to that using random seeds. 
### 405.Improving Online Multiple Object tracking with Deep Metric Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07592.pdf)
> Tracking by detection is a common approach to solving the Multiple Object Tracking problem. In this paper we show how deep metric learning can be used to improve three aspects of tracking by detection. We train a convolutional neural network to learn an embedding function in a Siamese configuration on a large person re-identification dataset offline. It is then used to improve the online performance of tracking while retaining a high frame rate. We use this learned appearance metric to robustly build estimates of pedestrian's trajectories in the MOT16 dataset. In breaking with the tracking by detection model, we use our appearance metric to propose detections using the predicted state of a tracklet as a prior in the case where the detector fails. This method achieves competitive results in evaluation, especially among online, real-time approaches. We present an ablative study showing the impact of each of the three uses of our deep appearance metric. 
### 406.Dynamic Risk Assessment for Vehicles of Higher Automation Levels by Deep  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07635.pdf)
> Vehicles of higher automation levels require the creation of situation awareness. One important aspect of this situation awareness is an understanding of the current risk of a driving situation. In this work, we present a novel approach for the dynamic risk assessment of driving situations based on images of a front stereo camera using deep learning. To this end, we trained a deep neural network with recorded monocular images, disparity maps and a risk metric for diverse traffic scenes. Our approach can be used to create the aforementioned situation awareness of vehicles of higher automation levels and can serve as a heterogeneous channel to systems based on radar or lidar sensors that are used traditionally for the calculation of risk metrics. 
### 407.Cross-Domain Deep Face Matching for Real Banking Security Systems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07644.pdf)
> Ensuring the security of transactions is currently one of the major challenges facing banking systems. The usage of face for biometric authentication of users is becoming adopted worldwide due its convenience and acceptability by people, and also given that, nowadays, almost all computers and mobile devices have built-in cameras. Such user authentication approach is attracting large investments from banking and financial institutions, especially in cross-domain scenarios, in which facial images from ID documents are compared with digital self-portraits (selfies) taken with the cameras of mobile devices, for the automated opening of new checking accounts or financial transactions authorization. In this work, besides of collecting a large cross-domain face database, with 27,002 real facial images of selfies and ID documents (13,501 subjects) captured from the systems of the major public Brazilian bank, we propose a novel approach for such cross-domain face matching based on deep features extracted by two well-referenced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Results obtained on the large dataset collected, which we called FaceBank, with accuracy rates higher than 93%, demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach to the cross-domain problem (comparing faces in IDs and selfies) and its feasible application in real banking security systems. 
### 408.Dynamic voting in multi-view learning for radiomics applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07686.pdf)
> Cancer diagnosis and treatment often require a personalized analysis for each patient nowadays, due to the heterogeneity among the different types of tumor and among patients. Radiomics is a recent medical imaging field that has shown during the past few years to be promising for achieving this personalization. However, a recent study shows that most of the state-of-the-art works in Radiomics fail to identify this problem as a multi-view learning task and that multi-view learning techniques are generally more efficient. In this work, we propose to further investigate the potential of one family of multi-view learning methods based on Multiple Classifiers Systems where one classifier is learnt on each view and all classifiers are combined afterwards. In particular, we propose a random forest based dynamic weighted voting scheme, which personalizes the combination of views for each new patient for classification tasks. The proposed method is validated on several real-world Radiomics problems. 
### 409.DEFRAG: Deep Euclidean Feature Representations through Adaptation on the  Grassmann Manifold [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07688.pdf)
> We propose a novel technique for training deep networks with the objective of obtaining feature representations that exist in a Euclidean space and exhibit strong clustering behavior. Our desired features representations have three traits: they can be compared using a standard Euclidian distance metric, samples from the same class are tightly clustered, and samples from different classes are well separated. However, most deep networks do not enforce such feature representations. The DEFRAG training technique consists of two steps: first good feature clustering behavior is encouraged though an auxiliary loss function based on the Silhouette clustering metric. Then the feature space is retracted onto a Grassmann manifold to ensure that the L_2 Norm forms a similarity metric. The DEFRAG technique achieves state of the art results on standard classification datasets using a relatively small network architecture with significantly fewer parameters than many standard networks. 
### 410.Multimodal feature fusion for CNN-based gait recognition: an empirical  comparison [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07753.pdf)
> People identification in video based on the way they walk (i.e. gait) is a relevant task in computer vision using a non-invasive approach. Standard and current approaches typically derive gait signatures from sequences of binary energy maps of subjects extracted from images, but this process introduces a large amount of non-stationary noise, thus, conditioning their efficacy. In contrast, in this paper we focus on the raw pixels, or simple functions derived from them, letting advanced learning techniques to extract relevant features. Therefore, we present a comparative study of different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures on three low-level features (i.e. gray pixels, optical flow channels and depth maps) on two widely-adopted and challenging datasets: TUM-GAID and CASIA-B. In addition, we perform a comparative study between different early and late fusion methods used to combine the information obtained from each kind of low-level features. Our experimental results suggest that (i) the use of hand-crafted energy maps (e.g. GEI) is not necessary, since equal or better results can be achieved from the raw pixels; (ii) the combination of multiple modalities (i.e. gray pixels, optical flow and depth maps) from different CNNs allows to obtain state-of-the-art results on the gait task with an image resolution several times smaller than the previously reported results; and, (iii) the selection of the architecture is a critical point that can make the difference between state-of-the-art results or poor results. 
### 411.Spatio-Temporal Channel Correlation Networks for Action Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07754.pdf)
> The work in this paper is driven by the question if spatio-temporal correlations are enough for 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN)? Most of the traditional 3D networks use local spatio-temporal features. We introduce a new block that models correlations between channels of a 3D CNN with respect to temporal and spatial features. This new block can be added as a residual unit to different parts of 3D CNNs. We name our novel block 'Spatio-Temporal Channel Correlation' (STC). By embedding this block to the current state-of-the-art architectures such as ResNext and ResNet, we improved the performance by 2-3\% on Kinetics dataset. Our experiments show that adding STC blocks to current state-of-the-art architectures outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the HMDB51, UCF101 and Kinetics datasets. The other issue in training 3D CNNs is about training them from scratch with a huge labeled dataset to get a reasonable performance. So the knowledge learned in 2D CNNs is completely ignored. Another contribution in this work is a simple and effective technique to transfer knowledge from a pre-trained 2D CNN to a randomly initialized 3D CNN for a stable weight initialization. This allows us to significantly reduce the number of training samples for 3D CNNs. Thus, by fine-tuning this network, we beat the performance of generic and recent methods in 3D CNNs, which were trained on large video datasets, e.g. Sports-1M, and fine-tuned on the target datasets, e.g. HMDB51/UCF101. 
### 412.Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-to-Image Translation on  Multi-Contrast MR Images - A Comparison of CycleGAN and UNIT [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07777.pdf)
> In medical imaging, a general problem is that it is costly and time consuming to collect high quality data from healthy and diseased subjects. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) is a deep learning method that has been developed for synthesizing data. GANs can thereby be used to generate more realistic training data, to improve classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Another application of GANs is image-to-image translations, e.g. generating magnetic resonance (MR) images from computed tomography (CT) images, which can be used to obtain multimodal datasets from a single modality. Here, we evaluate two unsupervised GAN models (CycleGAN and UNIT) for image-to-image translation of T1- and T2-weighted MR images, by comparing generated synthetic MR images to ground truth images. We also evaluate two supervised models; a modification of CycleGAN and a pure generator model. A small perceptual study was also performed to evaluate how visually realistic the synthesized images are. It is shown that the implemented GAN models can synthesize visually realistic MR images (incorrectly labeled as real by a human). It is also shown that models producing more visually realistic synthetic images not necessarily have better quantitative error measurements, when compared to ground truth data.

### 413.Histological images segmentation of mucous glands [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07781.pdf)
> Mucous glands lesions analysis and assessing of malignant potential of colon polyps are very important tasks of surgical pathology. However, differential diagnosis of colon polyps often seems impossible by classical methods and it is necessary to involve computer methods capable of assessing minimal differences to extend the capabilities of the classical pathology examination. Accurate segmentation of mucous glands from histology images is a crucial step to obtain reliable morphometric criteria for quantitative diagnostic methods. We review major trends in histological images segmentation and design a new convolutional neural network for mucous gland segmentation. 
### 414.Metric-Driven Learning of Correspondence Weighting for 2-D/3-D Image  Registration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07812.pdf)
> Registration of pre-operative 3-D volumes to intra-operative 2-D X-ray images is important in minimally invasive medical procedures. Rigid registration can be performed by estimating a global rigid motion that optimizes the alignment of local correspondences. However, inaccurate correspondences challenge the registration performance. To minimize their influence, we estimate optimal weights for correspondences using PointNet. We train the network directly with the criterion to minimize the registration error. We propose an objective function which includes point-to-plane correspondence-based motion estimation and projection error computation, thereby enabling the learning of a weighting strategy that optimally fits the underlying formulation of the registration task in an end-to-end fashion. For single-vertebra registration, we achieve an accuracy of 0.74$\pm$0.26 mm and highly improved robustness. The success rate is increased from 79.3 % to 94.3 % and the capture range from 3 mm to 13 mm. 
### 415.Disentangling Multiple Conditional Inputs in GANs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07819.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a method that disentangles the effects of multiple input conditions in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In particular, we demonstrate our method in controlling color, texture, and shape of a generated garment image for computer-aided fashion design. To disentangle the effect of input attributes, we customize conditional GANs with consistency loss functions. In our experiments, we tune one input at a time and show that we can guide our network to generate novel and realistic images of clothing articles. In addition, we present a fashion design process that estimates the input attributes of an existing garment and modifies them using our generator. 
### 416.Conditional Image Generation for Learning the Structure of Visual  Objects [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07823.pdf)
> In this paper, we consider the problem of learning landmarks for object categories without any manual annotations. We cast this as the problem of conditionally generating an image of an object from another one, where the images differ by acquisition time and/or viewpoint. The process is aided by providing the generator with a keypoint-like representation extracted from the target image through a tight bottleneck. This encourages the representation to distil information about the object geometry, which changes from source to target, while the appearance, which is shared between the source and target, is read off from the source alone. Conditioning simplifies the generation task significantly, to the point that adopting a simple perceptual loss instead of more sophisticated approaches such as adversarial training is sufficient to learn landmarks. We show that our method is applicable to a large variety of datasets - faces, people, 3D objects, and digits - without any modifications. We further demonstrate that we can learn landmarks from synthetic image deformations or videos, all without manual supervision, while outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised landmark detectors. 
### 417.How Bad is Good enough: Noisy annotations for instrument pose estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07836.pdf)
> Though analysis of Medical Images by Deep Learning achieves unprecedented results across various applications, the effect of \emph{noisy training annotations} is rarely studied in a systematic manner. In Medical Image Analysis, most reports addressing this question concentrate on studying segmentation performance of deep learning classifiers. The absence of continuous ground truth annotations in these studies limits the value of conclusions for applications, where regression is the primary method of choice. In the application of surgical instrument pose estimation, where precision has a direct clinical impact on patient outcome, studying the effect of \emph{noisy annotations} on deep learning pose estimation techniques is of supreme importance. Real x-ray images are inadequate for this evaluation due to the unavailability of ground truth annotations. We circumvent this problem by generating synthetic radiographs, where the ground truth pose is known and therefore the pose estimation error made by the medical-expert can be estimated from experiments. Furthermore, this study shows the property of deep neural networks to learn dominant signals from noisy annotations with sufficient data in a regression setting. 
### 418.Hide and Seek tracker: Real-time recovery from target loss [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07844.pdf)
> In this paper, we examine the real-time recovery of a video tracker from a target loss, using information that is already available from the original tracker and without a significant computational overhead. More specifically, before using the tracker output to update the target position we estimate the detection confidence. In the case of a low confidence, the position update is rejected and the tracker passes to a single-frame failure mode, during which the patch low-level visual content is used to swiftly update the object position, before recovering from the target loss in the next frame. Orthogonally to this improvement, we further enhance the running average method used for creating the query model in tracking-through-similarity. The experimental evidence provided by evaluation on standard tracking datasets (OTB-50, OTB-100 and OTB-2013) validate that target recovery can be successfully achieved without compromising the real-time update of the target position. 
### 419.Hybrid Bayesian Eigenobjects: Combining Linear Subspace and Deep Network  Methods for 3D Robot Vision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07872.pdf)
> We introduce Hybrid Bayesian Eigenobjects (HBEOs), a novel representation for 3D objects designed to allow a robot to jointly estimate the pose, class, and full 3D geometry of a novel object observed from a single viewpoint in a single practical framework. By combining both linear subspace methods and deep convolutional prediction, HBEOs efficiently learn nonlinear object representations without directly regressing into high-dimensional space. HBEOs also remove the onerous and generally impractical necessity of input data voxelization prior to inference. We experimentally evaluate the suitability of HBEOs to the challenging task of joint pose, class, and shape inference on novel objects and show that, compared to preceding work, HBEOs offer dramatically improved performance in all three tasks along with several orders of magnitude faster runtime performance. 
### 420.A Hierarchical Deep Architecture and Mini-Batch Selection Method For  Joint Traffic Sign and Light Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07987.pdf)
> Traffic light and sign detectors on autonomous cars are integral for road scene perception. The literature is abundant with deep learning networks that detect either lights or signs, not both, which makes them unsuitable for real-life deployment due to the limited graphics processing unit (GPU) memory and power available on embedded systems. The root cause of this issue is that no public dataset contains both traffic light and sign labels, which leads to difficulties in developing a joint detection framework. We present a deep hierarchical architecture in conjunction with a mini-batch proposal selection mechanism that allows a network to detect both traffic lights and signs from training on separate traffic light and sign datasets. Our method solves the overlapping issue where instances from one dataset are not labelled in the other dataset. We are the first to present a network that performs joint detection on traffic lights and signs. We measure our network on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K benchmark for traffic sign detection and the Bosch Small Traffic Lights benchmark for traffic light detection and show it outperforms the existing Bosch Small Traffic light state-of-the-art method. We focus on autonomous car deployment and show our network is more suitable than others because of its low memory footprint and real-time image processing time.

### 421.Novel Convolution Kernels for Computer Vision and Shape Analysis based  on Electromagnetism [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07996.pdf)
> Computer vision is a growing field with a lot of new applications in automation and robotics, since it allows the analysis of images and shapes for the generation of numerical or analytical information. One of the most used method of information extraction is image filtering through convolution kernels, with each kernel specialized for specific applications. The objective of this paper is to present a novel convolution kernels, based on principles of electromagnetic potentials and fields, for a general use in computer vision and to demonstrate its usage for shape and stroke analysis. Such filtering possesses unique geometrical properties that can be interpreted using well understood physics theorems. Therefore, this paper focuses on the development of the electromagnetic kernels and on their application on images for shape and stroke analysis. It also presents several interesting features of electromagnetic kernels, such as resolution, size and orientation independence, robustness to noise and deformation, long distance stroke interaction and ability to work with 3D images 
### 422.Stability of Scattering Decoder For Nonlinear Diffractive Imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08015.pdf)
> The problem of image reconstruction under multiple light scattering is usually formulated as a regularized non-convex optimization. A deep learning architecture, Scattering Decoder (ScaDec), was recently proposed to solve this problem in a purely data-driven fashion. The proposed method was shown to substantially outperform optimization-based baselines and achieve state-of-the-art results. In this paper, we thoroughly test the robustness of ScaDec to different permittivity contrasts, number of transmissions, and input signal-to-noise ratios. The results on high-fidelity simulated datasets show that the performance of ScaDec is stable in different settings. 
### 423.Pixel-level Reconstruction and Classification for Noisy Handwritten  Bangla Characters [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08037.pdf)
> Classification techniques for images of handwritten characters are susceptible to noise. Quadtrees can be an efficient representation for learning from sparse features. In this paper, we improve the effectiveness of probabilistic quadtrees by using a pixel level classifier to extract the character pixels and remove noise from handwritten character images. The pixel level denoiser (a deep belief network) uses the map responses obtained from a pretrained CNN as features for reconstructing the characters eliminating noise. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reconstructing and classifying a noisy version of handwritten Bangla Numeral and Basic Character datasets. 
### 424.Error Compensated Quantized SGD and its Applications to Large-scale  Distributed Optimization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08054.pdf)
> Large-scale distributed optimization is of great importance in various applications. For data-parallel based distributed learning, the inter-node gradient communication often becomes the performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose the error compensated quantized stochastic gradient descent algorithm to improve the training efficiency. Local gradients are quantized to reduce the communication overhead, and accumulated quantization error is utilized to speed up the convergence. Furthermore, we present theoretical analysis on the convergence behaviour, and demonstrate its advantage over competitors. Extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm can compress gradients by a factor of up to two magnitudes without performance degradation. 
### 425.Finding Original Image Of A Sub Image Using CNNs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08078.pdf)
> Convolututional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art in image classification, object detection and other image related tasks. In this paper I present another use of CNNs i.e. if given a set of images and then giving a single test image the network identifies that the test image is part of which image from the images given before. This is a task somehow similar to measuring image similarity and can be done using a simple CNN. Doing this task manually by looping can be quite a time consuming problem and won't be a generalizable solution. The task is quite similar to doing object detection but for that lots training data should be given or in the case of sliding window it takes lot of time and my algorithm can work with much fewer examples, is totally unsupervised and works much efficiently. Also, I explain that how unsupervised algorithm like K-Means or supervised algorithm like K-NN are not good enough to perform this task. The basic idea is that image encodings are collected for each image from a CNN, when a test image comes it is replaced by a part of original image, the encoding is generated using the same network, the frobenius norm is calculated and if it comes under a tolerance level then the test image is said to be the part of the original image. 
### 426.Deep Reinforcement Learning for Surgical Gesture Segmentation and  Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08089.pdf)
> Recognition of surgical gesture is crucial for surgical skill assessment and efficient surgery training. Prior works on this task are based on either variant graphical models such as HMMs and CRFs, or deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks. Most of the current approaches usually suffer from over-segmentation and therefore low segment-level edit scores. In contrast, we present an essentially different methodology by modeling the task as a sequential decision-making process. An intelligent agent is trained using reinforcement learning with hierarchical features from a deep model. Temporal consistency is integrated into our action design and reward mechanism to reduce over-segmentation errors. Experiments on JIGSAWS dataset demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art methods in terms of the edit score and on par in frame-wise accuracy. Our code will be released later. 
### 427.Hypergraph p-Laplacian Regularization for Remote Sensing Image  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08104.pdf)
> It is of great importance to preserve locality and similarity information in semi-supervised learning (SSL) based applications. Graph based SSL and manifold regularization based SSL including Laplacian regularization (LapR) and Hypergraph Laplacian regularization (HLapR) are representative SSL methods and have achieved prominent performance by exploiting the relationship of sample distribution. However, it is still a great challenge to exactly explore and exploit the local structure of the data distribution. In this paper, we present an effect and effective approximation algorithm of Hypergraph p-Laplacian and then propose Hypergraph p-Laplacian regularization (HpLapR) to preserve the geometry of the probability distribution. In particular, p-Laplacian is a nonlinear generalization of the standard graph Laplacian and Hypergraph is a generalization of a standard graph. Therefore, the proposed HpLapR provides more potential to exploiting the local structure preserving. We apply HpLapR to logistic regression and conduct the implementations for remote sensing image recognition. We compare the proposed HpLapR to several popular manifold regularization based SSL methods including LapR, HLapR and HpLapR on UC-Merced dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HpLapR. 
### 428.Ensemble p-Laplacian Regularization for Remote Sensing Image Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08109.pdf)
> Recently, manifold regularized semi-supervised learning (MRSSL) received considerable attention because it successfully exploits the geometry of the intrinsic data probability distribution including both labeled and unlabeled samples to leverage the performance of a learning model. As a natural nonlinear generalization of graph Laplacian, p-Laplacian has been proved having the rich theoretical foundations to better preserve the local structure. However, it is difficult to determine the fitting graph p-Lapalcian i.e. the parameter which is a critical factor for the performance of graph p-Laplacian. Therefore, we develop an ensemble p-Laplacian regularization (EpLapR) to fully approximate the intrinsic manifold of the data distribution. EpLapR incorporates multiple graphs into a regularization term in order to sufficiently explore the complementation of graph p-Laplacian. Specifically, we construct a fused graph by introducing an optimization approach to assign suitable weights on different p-value graphs. And then, we conduct semi-supervised learning framework on the fused graph. Extensive experiments on UC-Merced data set demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. 
### 429.Symmetry Aware Evaluation of 3D Object Detection and Pose Estimation in  Scenes of Many Parts in Bulk [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08129.pdf)
> While 3D object detection and pose estimation has been studied for a long time, its evaluation is not yet completely satisfactory. Indeed, existing datasets typically consist in numerous acquisitions of only a few scenes because of the tediousness of pose annotation, and existing evaluation protocols cannot handle properly objects with symmetries. This work aims at addressing those two points. We first present automatic techniques to produce fully annotated RGBD data of many object instances in arbitrary poses, with which we produce a dataset of thousands of independent scenes of bulk parts composed of both real and synthetic images. We then propose a consistent evaluation methodology suitable for any rigid object, regardless of its symmetries. We illustrate it with two reference object detection and pose estimation methods on different objects, and show that incorporating symmetry considerations into pose estimation methods themselves can lead to significant performance gains. The proposed dataset is available at <a href="http://rbregier.github.io/dataset2017.">this http URL</a> 
### 430.CaloriNet: From silhouettes to calorie estimation in private  environments [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08152.pdf)
> We propose a novel deep fusion architecture, CaloriNet, for the online estimation of energy expenditure for free living monitoring in private environments, where RGB data is discarded and replaced by silhouettes. Our fused convolutional neural network architecture is trainable end-to-end, to estimate calorie expenditure, using temporal foreground silhouettes alongside accelerometer data. The network is trained and cross-validated on a publicly available dataset, SPHERE_RGBD + Inertial_calorie. Results show state-of-the-art minimum error on the estimation of energy expenditure (calories per minute), outperforming alternative, standard and single-modal techniques. 
### 431.A convex method for classification of groups of examples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08169.pdf)
> There are many applications where it important to perform well on a set of examples as opposed to individual examples. For example in image or video classification the question is does an object appear somewhere in the image or video while there are several candidates of the object per image or video. In this context, it is not important what is the performance per candidate. Instead the performance per group is the ultimate objective. <br />For such problems one popular approach assumes weak supervision where labels exist for the entire group and then multiple instance learning is utilized. Another approach is to optimize per candidate, assuming each candidate is labeled, in the belief that this will achieve good performance per group. <br />We will show that better results can be achieved if we offer a new methodology which synthesizes the aforementioned approaches and directly optimizes for the final optimization objective while consisting of a convex optimization problem which solves the global optimization problem. The benefit of grouping examples is demonstrated on an image classification task for detecting polyps in images from capsule endoscopy of the colon. The algorithm was designed to efficiently handle hundreds of millions of examples. Furthermore, modifications to the penalty function of the standard SVM algorithm, have proven to significantly improve performance in our test case. 
### 432.Crowd disagreement about medical images is informative [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08174.pdf)
> Classifiers for medical image analysis are often trained with a single consensus label, based on combining labels given by experts or crowds. However, disagreement between annotators may be informative, and thus removing it may not be the best strategy. As a proof of concept, we predict whether a skin lesion from the ISIC 2017 dataset is a melanoma or not, based on crowd annotations of visual characteristics of that lesion. We compare using the mean annotations, illustrating consensus, to standard deviations and other distribution moments, illustrating disagreement. We show that the mean annotations perform best, but that the disagreement measures are still informative. We also make the crowd annotations used in this paper available at \url{<a href="https://figshare.com/s/5cbbce14647b66286544">this https URL</a>}. 
### 433.Characterizing multiple instance datasets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08186.pdf)
> In many pattern recognition problems, a single feature vector is not sufficient to describe an object. In multiple instance learning (MIL), objects are represented by sets (\emph{bags}) of feature vectors (\emph{instances}). This requires an adaptation of standard supervised classifiers in order to train and evaluate on these bags of instances. Like for supervised classification, several benchmark datasets and numerous classifiers are available for MIL. When performing a comparison of different MIL classifiers, it is important to understand the differences of the datasets, used in the comparison. Seemingly different (based on factors such as dimensionality) datasets may elicit very similar behaviour in classifiers, and vice versa. This has implications for what kind of conclusions may be drawn from the comparison results. We aim to give an overview of the variability of available benchmark datasets and some popular MIL classifiers. We use a dataset dissimilarity measure, based on the differences between the ROC-curves obtained by different classifiers, and embed this dataset dissimilarity matrix into a low-dimensional space. Our results show that conceptually similar datasets can behave very differently. We therefore recommend examining such dataset characteristics when making comparisons between existing and new MIL classifiers. <br />The datasets are available via Figshare at \url{<a href="https://bit.ly/2K9iTja">this https URL</a>}. 
### 434.DPP-Net: Device-aware Progressive Search for Pareto-optimal Neural  Architectures [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08198.pdf)
> Recent breakthroughs in Neural Architectural Search (NAS) have achieved state-of-the-art performances in applications such as image classification and language modeling. However, these techniques typically ignore device-related objectives such as inference time, memory usage, and power consumption. Optimizing neural architecture for device-related objectives is immensely crucial for deploying deep networks on portable devices with limited computing resources. We propose DPP-Net: Device-aware Progressive Search for Pareto-optimal Neural Architectures, optimizing for both device-related (e.g., inference time and memory usage) and device-agnostic (e.g., accuracy and model size) objectives. DPP-Net employs a compact search space inspired by current state-of-the-art mobile CNNs, and further improves search efficiency by adopting progressive search (Liu et al. 2017). Experimental results on CIFAR-10 are poised to demonstrate the effectiveness of Pareto-optimal networks found by DPP-Net, for three different devices: (1) a workstation with Titan X GPU, (2) NVIDIA Jetson TX1 embedded system, and (3) mobile phone with ARM Cortex-A53. Compared to CondenseNet and NASNet (Mobile), DPP-Net achieves better performances: higher accuracy and shorter inference time on various devices. Additional experimental results show that models found by DPP-Net also achieve considerably-good performance on ImageNet as well. 
### 435.Synaptic partner prediction from point annotations in insect brains [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08205.pdf)
> High-throughput electron microscopy allows recording of lar- ge stacks of neural tissue with sufficient resolution to extract the wiring diagram of the underlying neural network. Current efforts to automate this process focus mainly on the segmentation of neurons. However, in order to recover a wiring diagram, synaptic partners need to be identi- fied as well. This is especially challenging in insect brains like Drosophila melanogaster, where one presynaptic site is associated with multiple post- synaptic elements. Here we propose a 3D U-Net architecture to directly identify pairs of voxels that are pre- and postsynaptic to each other. To that end, we formulate the problem of synaptic partner identification as a classification problem on long-range edges between voxels to encode both the presence of a synaptic pair and its direction. This formulation allows us to directly learn from synaptic point annotations instead of more ex- pensive voxel-based synaptic cleft or vesicle annotations. We evaluate our method on the MICCAI 2016 CREMI challenge and improve over the current state of the art, producing 3% fewer errors than the next best method. 
### 436.Semi-supervised Seizure Prediction with Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08235.pdf)
> In this article, we propose an approach that can make use of not only labeled EEG signals but also the unlabeled ones which is more accessible. We also suggest the use of data fusion to further improve the seizure prediction accuracy. Data fusion in our vision includes EEG signals, cardiogram signals, body temperature and time. We use the short-time Fourier transform on 28-s EEG windows as a pre-processing step. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained in an unsupervised manner where information of seizure onset is disregarded. The trained Discriminator of the GAN is then used as feature extractor. Features generated by the feature extractor are classified by two fully-connected layers (can be replaced by any classifier) for the labeled EEG signals. This semi-supervised seizure prediction method achieves area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 77.68% and 75.47% for the CHBMIT scalp EEG dataset and the Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG dataset, respectively. Unsupervised training without the need of labeling is important because not only it can be performed in real-time during EEG signal recording, but also it does not require feature engineering effort for each patient. 
### 437.Sampling Clustering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08245.pdf)
> We propose an efficient graph-based divisive cluster analysis approach called sampling clustering. It constructs a lite informative dendrogram by recursively dividing a graph into subgraphs. In each recursive call, a graph is sampled first with a set of vertices being removed to disconnect latent clusters, then condensed by adding edges to the remaining vertices to avoid graph fragmentation caused by vertex removals. We also present some sampling and condensing methods and discuss the effectiveness in this paper. Our implementations run in linear time and achieve outstanding performance on various types of datasets. Experimental results show that they outperform state-of-the-art clustering algorithms with significantly less computing resources requirements. 
### 438.Learning Shared Multimodal Embeddings with Unpaired Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08251.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a method to learn a joint multimodal embedding space. We compare the effect of various constraints using paired text and video data. Additionally, we propose a method to improve the joint embedding space using an adversarial formulation with unpaired text and video data. In addition to testing on publicly available datasets, we introduce a new, large-scale text/video dataset. We experimentally confirm that learning such a shared embedding space benefits three difficult tasks (i) zero-shot activity classification, (ii) unsupervised activity discovery, and (iii) unseen activity captioning. 
### 439.Don&#x27;t only Feel Read: Using Scene text to understand advertisements [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08279.pdf)
> We propose a framework for automated classification of Advertisement Images, using not just Visual features but also Textual cues extracted from embedded text. Our approach takes inspiration from the assumption that Ad images contain meaningful textual content, that can provide discriminative semantic interpretetion, and can thus aid in classifcation tasks. To this end, we develop a framework using off-the-shelf components, and demonstrate the effectiveness of Textual cues in semantic Classfication tasks. 
### 440.Layouts from Panoramic Images with Geometry and Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08294.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel procedure for 3D layout recovery of indoor scenes from single 360 degrees panoramic images. With such images, all scene is seen at once, allowing to recover closed geometries. Our method combines strategically the accuracy provided by geometric reasoning (lines and vanishing points) with the higher level of data abstraction and pattern recognition achieved by deep learning techniques (edge and normal maps). Thus, we extract structural corners from which we generate layout hypotheses of the room assuming Manhattan world. The best layout model is selected, achieving good performance on both simple rooms (box-type) and complex shaped rooms (with more than four walls). Experiments of the proposed approach are conducted within two public datasets, SUN360 and Stanford (2D-3D-S) demonstrating the advantages of estimating layouts by combining geometry and deep learning and the effectiveness of our proposal with respect to the state of the art. 
### 441.Are good local minima wide in sparse recovery? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08296.pdf)
> The idea of compressed sensing is to exploit representations in suitable (overcomplete) dictionaries that allow to recover signals far beyond the Nyquist rate provided that they admit a sparse representation in the respective dictionary. The latter gives rise to the sparse recovery problem of finding the best sparse linear approximation of given data in a given generating system. In this paper we analyze the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm as one of the most popular greedy methods for solving the sparse recovery problem, and demonstrate that systematically perturbing the IHT algorithm by adding noise to intermediate iterates yields improved results. Further improvements can be obtained by entirely rephrasing the problem as a parametric deep-learning-type of optimization problem. By introducing perturbations via dropout, we demonstrate to significantly outperform the classical IHT algorithm, obtaining $3$ to $6$ times lower average objective errors. 
### 442.Can Deep Learning Relax Endomicroscopy Hardware Miniaturization  Requirements? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08338.pdf)
> Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel imaging modality that provides in vivo histological cross-sections of examined tissue. Recently, attempts have been made to develop miniaturized in vivo imaging devices, specifically confocal laser microscopes, for both clinical and research applications. However, current implementations of miniature CLE components, such as confocal lenses, compromise image resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, or both, which negatively impacts the utility of in vivo imaging. In this work, we demonstrate that software-based techniques can be used to recover lost information due to endomicroscopy hardware miniaturization and reconstruct images of higher resolution. Particularly, a densely connected convolutional neural network is used to reconstruct a high-resolution CLE image from a low-resolution input. In the proposed network, each layer is directly connected to all subsequent layers, which results in an effective combination of low-level and high-level features and efficient information flow throughout the network. To train and evaluate our network, we use a dataset of 181 high-resolution CLE images. Both quantitative and qualitative results indicate superiority of the proposed network compared to traditional interpolation techniques and competing learning-based methods. This work demonstrates that software-based super-resolution is a viable approach to compensate for loss of resolution due to endoscopic hardware miniaturization. 
### 443.Learning Instance Segmentation by Interaction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08354.pdf)
> We present an approach for building an active agent that learns to segment its visual observations into individual objects by interacting with its environment in a completely self-supervised manner. The agent uses its current segmentation model to infer pixels that constitute objects and refines the segmentation model by interacting with these pixels. The model learned from over 50K interactions generalizes to novel objects and backgrounds. To deal with noisy training signal for segmenting objects obtained by self-supervised interactions, we propose robust set loss. A dataset of robot's interactions along-with a few human labeled examples is provided as a benchmark for future research. We test the utility of the learned segmentation model by providing results on a downstream vision-based control task of rearranging multiple objects into target configurations from visual inputs alone. Videos, code, and robotic interaction dataset are available at <a href="https://pathak22.github.io/seg-by-interaction/">this https URL</a> 
### 444.Star Shape Prior in Fully Convolutional Networks for Skin Lesion  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08437.pdf)
> Semantic segmentation is an important preliminary step towards automatic medical image interpretation. Recently deep convolutional neural networks have become the first choice for the task of pixel-wise class prediction. While incorporating prior knowledge about the structure of target objects has proven effective in traditional energy-based segmentation approaches, there has not been a clear way for encoding prior knowledge into deep learning frameworks. In this work, we propose a new loss term that encodes the star shape prior into the loss function of an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network (FCN) framework. We penalize non-star shape segments in FCN prediction maps to guarantee a global structure in segmentation results. Our experiments demonstrate the advantage of regularizing FCN parameters by the star shape prior and our results on the ISBI 2017 skin segmentation challenge data set achieve the first rank in the segmentation task among $21$ participating teams. 
### 445.TriResNet: A Deep Triple-stream Residual Network for Histopathology  Grading [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08463.pdf)
> While microscopic analysis of histopathological slides is generally considered as the gold standard method for performing cancer diagnosis and grading, the current method for analysis is extremely time consuming and labour intensive as it requires pathologists to visually inspect tissue samples in a detailed fashion for the presence of cancer. As such, there has been significant recent interest in computer aided diagnosis systems for analysing histopathological slides for cancer grading to aid pathologists to perform cancer diagnosis and grading in a more efficient, accurate, and consistent manner. In this work, we investigate and explore a deep triple-stream residual network (TriResNet) architecture for the purpose of tile-level histopathology grading, which is the critical first step to computer-aided whole-slide histopathology grading. In particular, the design mentality behind the proposed TriResNet network architecture is to facilitate for the learning of a more diverse set of quantitative features to better characterize the complex tissue characteristics found in histopathology samples. Experimental results on two widely-used computer-aided histopathology benchmark datasets (CAMELYON16 dataset and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) dataset) demonstrated that the proposed TriResNet network architecture was able to achieve noticeably improved accuracies when compared with two other state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network architectures. Based on these promising results, the hope is that the proposed TriResNet network architecture could become a useful tool to aiding pathologists increase the consistency, speed, and accuracy of the histopathology grading process. 
### 446.Learning a High Fidelity Pose Invariant Model for High-resolution Face  Frontalization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08472.pdf)
> Face frontalization refers to the process of synthesizing the frontal view of a face from a given profile. Due to self-occlusion and appearance distortion in the wild, it is extremely challenging to recover faithful results and preserve texture details in a high-resolution. This paper proposes a High Fidelity Pose Invariant Model (HF-PIM) to produce photographic and identity-preserving results. HF-PIM frontalizes the profiles through a novel texture fusion warping procedure and leverages a dense correspondence field to bind the 2D and 3D surface space. We decompose the prerequisite of warping into correspondence field estimation and facial texture recovering, which are both well addressed by deep networks. Different from those reconstruction methods relying on 3D data, we also propose Adversarial Residual Dictionary Learning (ARDL) to supervise facial texture map recovering with only monocular images. Exhaustive experiments on both controlled and uncontrolled environments demonstrate that the proposed method not only boosts the performance of pose-invariant face recognition but also dramatically improves high-resolution frontalization appearances. 
### 447.Video Inpainting by Jointly Learning Temporal Structure and Spatial  Details [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08482.pdf)
> We present a new data-driven video inpainting method for recovering missing regions of video frames. A novel deep learning architecture is proposed which contains two sub-networks: a temporal structure inference network and a spatial detail recovering network. The temporal structure inference network is built upon a 3D fully convolutional architecture: It only learns to complete a low-resolution video volume given the expensive computational cost of 3D convolution. The low resolution result provides temporal guidance to the spatial detail recovering network, which performs image-based inpainting with a 2D fully convolutional network to produce recovered video frames in their original resolution. Such two-step network design ensures both the spatial quality of each frame and the temporal coherence across frames. Our method jointly trains both sub-networks in an end-to-end manner. We provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation on three datasets, demonstrating that our method outperforms previous learning-based video inpainting methods. 
### 448.Visual-Inertial Object Detection and Mapping [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08498.pdf)
> We present a method to populate an unknown environment with models of previously seen objects, placed in a Euclidean reference frame that is inferred causally and on-line using monocular video along with inertial sensors. The system we implement returns a sparse point cloud for the regions of the scene that are visible but not recognized as a previously seen object, and a detailed object model and its pose in the Euclidean frame otherwise. The system includes bottom-up and top-down components, whereby deep networks trained for detection provide likelihood scores for object hypotheses provided by a nonlinear filter, whose state serves as memory. Additional networks provide likelihood scores for edges, which complements detection networks trained to be invariant to small deformations. We test our algorithm on existing datasets, and also introduce the VISMA dataset, that provides ground truth pose, point-cloud map, and object models, along with time-stamped inertial measurements. 
### 449.Global Semantic Consistency for Zero-Shot Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08503.pdf)
> In image recognition, there are many cases where training samples cannot cover all target classes. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) utilizes the class semantic information to classify samples of the unseen categories that have no corresponding samples contained in the training set. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework, called Global Semantic Consistency Network (GSC-Net for short), which makes complete use of the semantic information of both seen and unseen classes, to support effective zero-shot learning. We also adopt a soft label embedding loss to further exploit the semantic relationships among classes. To adapt GSC-Net to a more practical setting, Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL), we introduce a parametric novelty detection mechanism. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ZSL and GZSL tasks over three visual attribute datasets, which validates the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed framework. 
### 450.Efficient Semantic Segmentation using Gradual Grouping [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08522.pdf)
> Deep CNNs for semantic segmentation have high memory and run time requirements. Various approaches have been proposed to make CNNs efficient like grouped, shuffled, depth-wise separable convolutions. We study the effectiveness of these techniques on a real-time semantic segmentation architecture like ERFNet for improving run time by over 5X. We apply these techniques to CNN layers partially or fully and evaluate the testing accuracies on Cityscapes dataset. We obtain accuracy vs parameters/FLOPs trade offs, giving accuracy scores for models that can run under specified runtime budgets. We further propose a novel training procedure which starts out with a dense convolution but gradually evolves towards a grouped convolution. We show that our proposed training method and efficient architecture design can improve accuracies by over 8% with depth wise separable convolutions applied on the encoder of ERFNet and attaching a light weight decoder. This results in a model which has a 5X improvement in FLOPs while only suffering a 4% degradation in accuracy with respect to ERFNet. 
### 451.Focusing on What is Relevant: Time-Series Learning and Understanding  using Attention [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08523.pdf)
> This paper is a contribution towards interpretability of the deep learning models in different applications of time-series. We propose a temporal attention layer that is capable of selecting the relevant information to perform various tasks, including data completion, key-frame detection and classification. The method uses the whole input sequence to calculate an attention value for each time step. This results in more focused attention values and more plausible visualisation than previous methods. We apply the proposed method to three different tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed network produces comparable results to a state of the art. In addition, the network provides better interpretability of the decision, that is, it generates more significant attention weight to related frames compared to similar techniques attempted in the past. 
### 452.Deep Spectral Convolution Network for HyperSpectral Unmixing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08562.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel hyperspectral unmixing technique based on deep spectral convolution networks (DSCN). Particularly, three important contributions are presented throughout this paper. First, fully-connected linear operation is replaced with spectral convolutions to extract local spectral characteristics from hyperspectral signatures with a deeper network architecture. Second, instead of batch normalization, we propose a spectral normalization layer which improves the selectivity of filters by normalizing their spectral responses. Third, we introduce two fusion configurations that produce ideal abundance maps by using the abstract representations computed from previous layers. In experiments, we use two real datasets to evaluate the performance of our method with other baseline techniques. The experimental results validate that the proposed method outperforms baselines based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). 
### 453.An accurate retrieval through R-MAC+ descriptors for landmark  recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08565.pdf)
> The landmark recognition problem is far from being solved, but with the use of features extracted from intermediate layers of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excellent results have been obtained. In this work, we propose some improvements on the creation of R-MAC descriptors in order to make the newly-proposed R-MAC+ descriptors more representative than the previous ones. However, the main contribution of this paper is a novel retrieval technique, that exploits the fine representativeness of the MAC descriptors of the database images. Using this descriptors called "db regions" during the retrieval stage, the performance is greatly improved. The proposed method is tested on different public datasets: Oxford5k, Paris6k and Holidays. It outperforms the state-of-the- art results on Holidays and reached excellent results on Oxford5k and Paris6k, overcame only by approaches based on fine-tuning strategies. 
### 454.Point cloud segmentation using hierarchical tree for architectural  models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08572.pdf)
> Recent developments in the 3D scanning technologies have made the generation of highly accurate 3D point clouds relatively easy but the segmentation of these point clouds remains a challenging area. A number of techniques have set precedent of either planar or primitive based segmentation in literature. In this work, we present a novel and an effective primitive based point cloud segmentation algorithm. The primary focus, i.e. the main technical contribution of our method is a hierarchical tree which iteratively divides the point cloud into segments. This tree uses an exclusive energy function and a 3D convolutional neural network, HollowNets to classify the segments. We test the efficacy of our proposed approach using both real and synthetic data obtaining an accuracy greater than 90% for domes and minarets. 
### 455.KinshipGAN: Synthesizing of Kinship Faces From Family Photos by  Regularizing a Deep Face Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08600.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a kinship generator network that can synthesize a possible child face by analyzing his/her parent's photo. For this purpose, we focus on to handle the scarcity of kinship datasets throughout the paper by proposing novel solutions in particular. To extract robust features, we integrate a pre-trained face model to the kinship face generator. Moreover, the generator network is regularized with an additional face dataset and adversarial loss to decrease the overfitting of the limited samples. Lastly, we adapt cycle-domain transformation to attain a more stable results. Experiments are conducted on Families in the Wild (FIW) dataset. The experimental results show that the contributions presented in the paper provide important performance improvements compared to the baseline architecture and our proposed method yields promising perceptual results. 
### 456.Ad-Net: Audio-Visual Convolutional Neural Network for Advertisement  Detection In Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08612.pdf)
> Personalized advertisement is a crucial task for many of the online businesses and video broadcasters. Many of today's broadcasters use the same commercial for all customers, but as one can imagine different viewers have different interests and it seems reasonable to have customized commercial for different group of people, chosen based on their demographic features, and history. In this project, we propose a framework, which gets the broadcast videos, analyzes them, detects the commercial and replaces it with a more suitable commercial. We propose a two-stream audio-visual convolutional neural network, that one branch analyzes the visual information and the other one analyzes the audio information, and then the audio and visual embedding are fused together, and are used for commercial detection, and content categorization. We show that using both the visual and audio content of the videos significantly improves the model performance for video analysis. This network is trained on a dataset of more than 50k regular video and commercial shots, and achieved much better performance compared to the models based on hand-crafted features. 
### 457.Deploying Deep Neural Networks in the Embedded Space [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08616.pdf)
> Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as the dominant model across various AI applications. In the era of IoT and mobile systems, the efficient deployment of DNNs on embedded platforms is vital to enable the development of intelligent applications. This paper summarises our recent work on the optimised mapping of DNNs on embedded settings. By covering such diverse topics as DNN-to-accelerator toolflows, high-throughput cascaded classifiers and domain-specific model design, the presented set of works aim to enable the deployment of sophisticated deep learning models on cutting-edge mobile and embedded systems. 
### 458.Towards safe deep learning: accurately quantifying biomarker uncertainty  in neural network predictions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08640.pdf)
> Automated medical image segmentation, specifically using deep learning, has shown outstanding performance in semantic segmentation tasks. However, these methods rarely quantify their uncertainty, which may lead to errors in downstream analysis. In this work we propose to use Bayesian neural networks to quantify uncertainty within the domain of semantic segmentation. We also propose a method to convert voxel-wise segmentation uncertainty into volumetric uncertainty, and calibrate the accuracy and reliability of confidence intervals of derived measurements. When applied to a tumour volume estimation application, we demonstrate that by using such modelling of uncertainty, deep learning systems can be made to report volume estimates with well-calibrated error-bars, making them safer for clinical use. We also show that the uncertainty estimates extrapolate to unseen data, and that the confidence intervals are robust in the presence of artificial noise. This could be used to provide a form of quality control and quality assurance, and may permit further adoption of deep learning tools in the clinic. 
### 459.Compact Deep Neural Networks for Computationally Efficient Gesture  Classification From Electromyography Signals [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08641.pdf)
> Machine learning classifiers using surface electromyography are important for human-machine interfacing and device control. Conventional classifiers such as support vector machines (SVMs) use manually extracted features based on e.g. wavelets. These features tend to be fixed and non-person specific, which is a key limitation due to high person-to-person variability of myography signals. Deep neural networks, by contrast, can automatically extract person specific features - an important advantage. However, deep neural networks typically have the drawback of large numbers of parameters, requiring large training data sets and powerful hardware not suited to embedded systems. This paper solves these problems by introducing a compact deep neural network architecture that is much smaller than existing counterparts. The performance of the compact deep net is benchmarked against an SVM and compared to other contemporary architectures across 10 human subjects, comparing Myo and Delsys Trigno electrode sets. The accuracy of the compact deep net was found to be 84.2 +/- 0.06% versus 70.5 +/- 0.07% for the SVM on the Myo, and 80.3+/- 0.07% versus 67.8 +/- 0.09% for the Delsys system, demonstrating the superior effectiveness of the proposed compact network, which had just 5,889 parameters - orders of magnitude less than some contemporary alternatives in this domain while maintaining better performance. 
### 460.Fully Convolutional Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks Applied  to Sclera Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08722.pdf)
> Due to the world's demand for security systems, biometrics can be seen as an important topic of research in computer vision. One of the biometric forms that has been gaining attention is the recognition based on sclera. The initial and paramount step for performing this type of recognition is the segmentation of the region of interest, i.e. the sclera. In this context, two approaches for such task based on the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are introduced in this work. FCN is similar to a common convolution neural network, however the fully connected layers (i.e., the classification layers) are removed from the end of the network and the output is generated by combining the output of pooling layers from different convolutional ones. The GAN is based on the game theory, where we have two networks competing with each other to generate the best segmentation. In order to perform fair comparison with baselines and quantitative and objective evaluations of the proposed approaches, we provide to the scientific community new 1,300 manually segmented images from two databases. The experiments are performed on the UBIRIS.v2 and MICHE databases and the best performing configurations of our propositions achieved F-score's measures of 87.48% and 88.32%, respectively. 
### 461.Keypoint Transfer for Fast Whole-Body Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08723.pdf)
> We introduce an approach for image segmentation based on sparse correspondences between keypoints in testing and training images. Keypoints represent automatically identified distinctive image locations, where each keypoint correspondence suggests a transformation between images. We use these correspondences to transfer label maps of entire organs from the training images to the test image. The keypoint transfer algorithm includes three steps: (i) keypoint matching, (ii) voting-based keypoint labeling, and (iii) keypoint-based probabilistic transfer of organ segmentations. We report segmentation results for abdominal organs in whole-body CT and MRI, as well as in contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. Our method offers a speed-up of about three orders of magnitude in comparison to common multi-atlas segmentation, while achieving an accuracy that compares favorably. Moreover, keypoint transfer does not require the registration to an atlas or a training phase. Finally, the method allows for the segmentation of scans with highly variable field-of-view. 
### 462.Scalable Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SSLIC) Using a Generic and  Parallel Approach [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08741.pdf)
> Superpixel algorithms have proven to be a useful initial step for segmentation and subsequent processing of images, reducing computational complexity by replacing the use of expensive per-pixel primitives with a higher-level abstraction, superpixels. They have been successfully applied both in the context of traditional image analysis and deep learning based approaches. In this work, we present a generalized implementation of the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) superpixel algorithm that has been generalized for n-dimensional scalar and multi-channel images. Additionally, the standard iterative implementation is replaced by a parallel, multi-threaded one. We describe the implementation details and analyze its scalability using a strong scaling formulation. Quantitative evaluation is performed using a 3D image, the Visible Human cryosection dataset, and a 2D image from the same dataset. Results show good scalability with runtime gains even when using a large number of threads that exceeds the physical number of available cores (hyperthreading). 
### 463.Augmented Reality-based Feedback for Technician-in-the-loop C-arm  Repositioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08814.pdf)
> Interventional C-arm imaging is crucial to percutaneous orthopedic procedures as it enables the surgeon to monitor the progress of surgery on the anatomy level. Minimally invasive interventions require repeated acquisition of X-ray images from different anatomical views to verify tool placement. Achieving and reproducing these views often comes at the cost of increased surgical time and radiation dose to both patient and staff. This work proposes a marker-free "technician-in-the-loop" Augmented Reality (AR) solution for C-arm repositioning. The X-ray technician operating the C-arm interventionally is equipped with a head-mounted display capable of recording desired C-arm poses in 3D via an integrated infrared sensor. For C-arm repositioning to a particular target view, the recorded C-arm pose is restored as a virtual object and visualized in an AR environment, serving as a perceptual reference for the technician. We conduct experiments in a setting simulating orthopedic trauma surgery. Our proof-of-principle findings indicate that the proposed system can decrease the 2.76 X-ray images required per desired view down to zero, suggesting substantial reductions of radiation dose during C-arm repositioning. The proposed AR solution is a first step towards facilitating communication between the surgeon and the surgical staff, improving the quality of surgical image acquisition, and enabling context-aware guidance for surgery rooms of the future. The concept of technician-in-the-loop design will become relevant to various interventions considering the expected advancements of sensing and wearable computing in the near future.

> Document Layout Analysis is a fundamental step in Handwritten Text Processing systems, form the extraction of the text lines to the type of region where it belongs. We present a system based on artificial neural networks which is able to extract not only the baselines present in the document, but geometric and logic layout analysis of the document as well. Experiments in three different datasets demonstrate the potential of the method and show competitive results with state-of-the-art methods. 
### 465.RUC+CMU: System Report for Dense Captioning Events in Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08854.pdf)
> This notebook paper presents our system in the ActivityNet Dense Captioning in Video task (task 3). Temporal proposal generation and caption generation are both important to the dense captioning task. Therefore, we propose a proposal ranking model to employ a set of effective feature representations for proposal generation, and ensemble a series of caption models enhanced with context information to generate captions robustly on predicted proposals. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the dense video captioning task with 8.529 METEOR score on the challenge testing set. 
### 466.A deep learning framework for segmentation of retinal layers from OCT  images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08859.pdf)
> Segmentation of retinal layers from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) volumes is a fundamental problem for any computer aided diagnostic algorithm development. This requires preprocessing steps such as denoising, region of interest extraction, flattening and edge detection all of which involve separate parameter tuning. In this paper, we explore deep learning techniques to automate all these steps and handle the presence/absence of pathologies. A model is proposed consisting of a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The CNN is used to extract layers of interest image and extract the edges, while the LSTM is used to trace the layer boundary. This model is trained on a mixture of normal and AMD cases using minimal data. Validation results on three public datasets show that the pixel-wise mean absolute error obtained with our system is 1.30 plus or minus 0.48 which is lower than the inter-marker error of 1.79 plus or minus 0.76. Our model's performance is also on par with the existing methods. 
### 467.GONet++: Traversability Estimation via Dynamic Scene View Synthesis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08864.pdf)
> Robots that interact with a dynamic environment, such as social robots and autonomous vehicles must be able to navigate through space safely to avoid injury or damage. Hence, effective identification of traversable and non-traversable spaces is crucial for mobile robot operation. In this paper, we propose to tackle the traversability estimation problem using a dynamic view synthesis based framework. View synthesis technique provides the ability to predict the traversability of a wide area around the robot. Unlike traditional view synthesis methods, our method can model dynamic obstacles such as humans, and predict where they would go in the future, allowing the robot to plan in advance and avoid potential collisions with dynamic obstacles. Our method GONet++ is built upon GONet. GONet is only able to predict the traversability of the space right in front of the robot. However, our method applies GONet on the predicted future frames to estimate the traversability of multiple locations around the robot. We demonstrate that our method both quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms the baseline methods in both view synthesis and traversability estimation tasks. 
### 468.Towards Practical Visual Search Engine within Elasticsearch [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08896.pdf)
> In this paper, we describe our end-to-end content-based image retrieval system built upon Elasticsearch, a well-known and popular textual search engine. As far as we know, this is the first time such a system has been implemented in eCommerce, and our efforts have turned out to be highly worthwhile. We end up with a novel and exciting visual search solution that is extremely easy to be deployed, distributed, scaled and monitored in a cost-friendly manner. Moreover, our platform is intrinsically flexible in supporting multimodal searches, where visual and textual information can be jointly leveraged in retrieval. <br />The core idea is to encode image feature vectors into a collection of string tokens in a way such that closer vectors will share more string tokens in common. By doing that, we can utilize Elasticsearch to efficiently retrieve similar images based on similarities within encoded sting tokens. As part of the development, we propose a novel vector to string encoding method, which is shown to substantially outperform the previous ones in terms of both precision and latency. <br />First-hand experiences in implementing this Elasticsearch-based platform are extensively addressed, which should be valuable to practitioners also interested in building visual search engine on top of Elasticsearch. 
### 469.Privacy-Protective-GAN for Face De-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08906.pdf)
> Face de-identification has become increasingly important as the image sources are explosively growing and easily accessible. The advance of new face recognition techniques also arises people's concern regarding the privacy leakage. The mainstream pipelines of face de-identification are mostly based on the k-same framework, which bears critiques of low effectiveness and poor visual quality. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Privacy-Protective-GAN (PP-GAN) that adapts GAN with novel verificator and regulator modules specially designed for the face de-identification problem to ensure generating de-identified output with retained structure similarity according to a single input. We evaluate the proposed approach in terms of privacy protection, utility preservation, and structure similarity. Our approach not only outperforms existing face de-identification techniques but also provides a practical framework of adapting GAN with priors of domain knowledge. 
### 470.Evaluation of Momentum Diverse Input Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method  (M-DI2-FGSM) Based Attack Method on MCS 2018 Adversarial Attacks on Black Box  Face Recognition System [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08970.pdf)
> The convolutional neural network is the crucial tool for the recent success of deep learning based methods on various computer vision tasks like classification, segmentation, and detection. Convolutional neural networks achieved state-of-the-art performance in these tasks and every day pushing the limit of computer vision and AI. However, adversarial attack on computer vision systems is threatening their application in the real life and in safety-critical applications. Necessarily, Finding adversarial examples are important to detect susceptible models to attack and take safeguard measures to overcome the adversarial attacks. In this regard, MCS 2018 Adversarial Attacks on Black Box Face Recognition challenge aims to facilitate the research of finding new adversarial attack techniques and their effectiveness in generating adversarial examples. In this challenge, the attack"s nature is targeted-attack on the black-box neural network where we have no knowledge about black-block"s inner structure. The attacker must modify a set of five images of a single person so that the neural network miss-classify them as target image which is a set of five images of another person. In this competition, we applied Momentum Diverse Input Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (M-DI2-FGSM) to make an adversarial attack on black-box face recognition system. We tested our method on MCS 2018 Adversarial Attacks on Black Box Face Recognition challenge and found competitive result. Our solution got validation score 1.404 which better than baseline score 1.407 and stood 14 place among 132 teams in the leader-board. Further improvement can be achieved by finding improved feature extraction from source image, carefully chosen hyper-parameters, finding improved substitute model of the black-box and better optimization method. 
### 471.Extracting Tree-structures in CT data by Tracking Multiple Statistically  Ranked Hypotheses [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08981.pdf)
> In this work, we adapt a method based on multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) that has been shown to give state-of-the-art vessel segmentation results in interactive settings, for the purpose of extracting trees. Regularly spaced tubular templates are fit to image data forming local hypotheses. These local hypotheses are used to construct the MHT tree, which is then traversed to make segmentation decisions. However, some critical parameters in this method are scale-dependent and have an adverse effect when tracking structures of varying dimensions. We propose to use statistical ranking of local hypotheses in constructing the MHT tree, which yields a probabilistic interpretation of scores across scales and helps alleviate the scale-dependence of MHT parameters. This enables our method to track trees starting from a single seed point. Our method is evaluated on chest CT data to extract airway trees and coronary arteries. In both cases, we show that our method performs significantly better than the original MHT method. 
### 472.Stroke-based Character Recognition with Deep Reinforcement Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08990.pdf)
> The stroke sequence of characters is significant for the character recognition task. In this paper, we propose a stroke-based character recognition (SCR) method. We train a stroke inference module under deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. This module extracts the sequence of strokes from characters, which can be integrated with character recognizers to improve their robustness to noise. Our experiments show that the module can handle complicated noise and reconstruct the characters. Meanwhile, it can also help achieve great ability in defending adversarial attacks of character recognizers. 
### 473.Leveraging Implicit Spatial Information in Global Features for Image  Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08991.pdf)
> Most image retrieval methods use global features that aggregate local distinctive patterns into a single representation. However, the aggregation process destroys the relative spatial information by considering orderless sets of local descriptors. We propose to integrate relative spatial information into the aggregation process by taking into account co-occurrences of local patterns in a tensor framework. The resulting signature called Improved Spatial Tensor Aggregation (ISTA) is able to reach state of the art performances on well known datasets such as Holidays, Oxford5k and Paris6k. 
### 474.Considerations for a PAP Smear Image Analysis System with CNN Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09025.pdf)
> It has been shown that for automated PAP-smear image classification, nucleus features can be very informative. Therefore, the primary step for automated screening can be cell-nuclei detection followed by segmentation of nuclei in the resulting single cell PAP-smear images. We propose a patch based approach using CNN for segmentation of nuclei in single cell images. We then pose the question of ion of segmentation for classification using representation learning with CNN, and whether low-level CNN features may be useful for classification. We suggest a CNN-based feature level analysis and a transfer learning based approach for classification using both segmented as well full single cell images. We also propose a decision-tree based approach for classification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms individually (with low-level CNN features), and simultaneously proving the sufficiency of cell-nuclei detection (rather than accurate segmentation) for classification. Thus, we propose a system for analysis of multi-cell PAP-smear images consisting of a simple nuclei detection algorithm followed by classification using transfer learning. 
### 475.Variational Wasserstein Clustering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09045.pdf)
> We propose a new clustering method based on optimal transportation. We solve optimal transportation with variational principles, and investigate the use of power diagrams as transportation plans for aggregating arbitrary domains into a fixed number of clusters. We iteratively drive centroids through target domains while maintaining the minimum clustering energy by adjusting the power diagrams. Thus, we simultaneously pursue clustering and the Wasserstein distances between the centroids and the target domains, resulting in a measure-preserving mapping. We demonstrate the use of our method in domain adaptation, remeshing, and representation learning on synthetic and real data. 
### 476.Disease Classification in Metagenomics with 2D Embeddings and Deep  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09046.pdf)
> Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown unprecedented success when applied to images, waveforms, and text. Generally, when the sample size ($N$) is much bigger than the number of features ($d$), DL often outperforms other machine learning (ML) techniques, often through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, in many bioinformatics fields (including metagenomics), we encounter the opposite situation where $d$ is significantly greater than $N$. In these situations, applying DL techniques would lead to severe overfitting. <br />Here we aim to improve classification of various diseases with metagenomic data through the use of CNNs. For this we proposed to represent metagenomic data as images. The proposed Met2Img approach relies on taxonomic and t-SNE embeddings to transform abundance data into "synthetic images". <br />We applied our approach to twelve benchmark data sets including more than 1400 metagenomic samples. Our results show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithms (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM)). We observe that the integration of phylogenetic information alongside abundance data improves classification. The proposed approach is not only important in classification setting but also allows to visualize complex metagenomic data. The Met2Img is implemented in Python. 
### 477.CT-image Super Resolution Using 3D Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09074.pdf)
> Computed Tomography (CT) imaging technique is widely used in geological exploration, medical diagnosis and other fields. In practice, however, the resolution of CT image is usually limited by scanning devices and great expense. Super resolution (SR) methods based on deep learning have achieved surprising performance in two-dimensional (2D) images. Unfortunately, there are few effective SR algorithms for three-dimensional (3D) images. In this paper, we proposed a novel network named as three-dimensional super resolution convolutional neural network (3DSRCNN) to realize voxel super resolution for CT images. To solve the practical problems in training process such as slow convergence of network training, insufficient memory, etc., we utilized adjustable learning rate, residual-learning, gradient clipping, momentum stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strategies to optimize training procedure. In addition, we have explored the empirical guidelines to set appropriate number of layers of network and how to use residual learning strategy. Additionally, previous learning-based algorithms need to separately train for different scale factors for reconstruction, yet our single model can complete the multi-scale SR. At last, our method has better performance in terms of PSNR, SSIM and efficiency compared with conventional methods. 
### 478.CNN-based Action Recognition and Supervised Domain Adaptation on 3D Body  Skeletons via Kernel Feature Maps [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09078.pdf)
> Deep learning is ubiquitous across many areas areas of computer vision. It often requires large scale datasets for training before being fine-tuned on small-to-medium scale problems. Activity, or, in other words, action recognition, is one of many application areas of deep learning. While there exist many Convolutional Neural Network architectures that work with the RGB and optical flow frames, training on the time sequences of 3D body skeleton joints is often performed via recurrent networks such as LSTM. <br />In this paper, we propose a new representation which encodes sequences of 3D body skeleton joints in texture-like representations derived from mathematically rigorous kernel methods. Such a representation becomes the first layer in a standard CNN network e.g., ResNet-50, which is then used in the supervised domain adaptation pipeline to transfer information from the source to target dataset. This lets us leverage the available Kinect-based data beyond training on a single dataset and outperform simple fine-tuning on any two datasets combined in a naive manner. More specifically, in this paper we utilize the overlapping classes between datasets. We associate datapoints of the same class via so-called commonality, known from the supervised domain adaptation. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on three publicly available benchmarks. 
### 479.Artwork Identification from Wearable Camera Images for Enhancing  Experience of Museum Audiences [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09084.pdf)
> Recommendation systems based on image recognition could prove a vital tool in enhancing the experience of museum audiences. However, for practical systems utilizing wearable cameras, a number of challenges exist which affect the quality of image recognition. In this pilot study, we focus on recognition of museum collections by using a wearable camera in three different museum spaces. We discuss the application of wearable cameras, and the practical and technical challenges in devising a robust system that can recognize artworks viewed by the visitors to create a detailed record of their visit. Specifically, to illustrate the impact of different kinds of museum spaces on image recognition, we collect three training datasets of museum exhibits containing variety of paintings, clocks, and sculptures. Subsequently, we equip selected visitors with wearable cameras to capture artworks viewed by them as they stroll along exhibitions. We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on each of the training sets for the purpose of artwork identification. In the testing stage, we use CNNs to identify artworks captured by the visitors with a wearable camera. We analyze the accuracy of their recognition and provide an insight into the applicability of such a system to further engage audiences with museum exhibitions. 
### 480.Segmentation of Overlapped Steatosis in Whole-Slide Liver Histopathology  Microscopy Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09090.pdf)
> An accurate steatosis quantification with pathology tissue samples is of high clinical importance. However, such pathology measurement is manually made in most clinical practices, subject to severe reader variability due to large sampling bias and poor reproducibility. Although some computerized automated methods are developed to quantify the steatosis regions, they present limited analysis capacity for high resolution whole-slide microscopy images and accurate overlapped steatosis division. In this paper, we propose a method that extracts an individual whole tissue piece at high resolution with minimum background area by estimating tissue bounding box and rotation angle. This is followed by the segmentation and segregation of steatosis regions with high curvature point detection and an ellipse fitting quality assessment method. We validate our method with isolated and overlapped steatosis regions in liver tissue images of 11 patients. The experimental results suggest that our method is promising for enhanced support of steatosis quantization during the pathology review for liver disease treatment. 
### 481.Analysis of Cellular Feature Differences of Astrocytomas with Distinct  Mutational Profiles Using Digitized Histopathology Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09093.pdf)
> Cellular phenotypic features derived from histopathology images are the basis of pathologic diagnosis and are thought to be related to underlying molecular profiles. Due to overwhelming cell numbers and population heterogeneity, it remains challenging to quantitatively compute and compare features of cells with distinct molecular signatures. In this study, we propose a self-reliant and efficient analysis framework that supports quantitative analysis of cellular phenotypic difference across distinct molecular groups. To demonstrate efficacy, we quantitatively analyze astrocytomas that are molecularly characterized as either Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant (MUT) or wildtype (WT) using imaging data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Representative cell instances that are phenotypically different between these two groups are retrieved after segmentation, feature computation, data pruning, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised clustering. Our analysis is generic and can be applied to a wide set of cell-based biomedical research. 
### 482.SSIMLayer: Towards Robust Deep Representation Learning via Nonlinear  Structural Similarity [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09152.pdf)
> Deeper convolutional neural networks provide more capacity to approximate complex mapping functions. However, increasing network depth imposes difficulties on training and increases model complexity. This paper presents a new nonlinear computational layer of considerably high capacity to the deep convolutional neural network architectures. This layer performs a set of comprehensive convolution operations that mimics the overall function of the human visual system (HVS) via focusing on learning structural information in its input. The core of its computations is evaluating the components of the structural similarity metric (SSIM) in a setting that allows the kernels to learn to match structural information. The proposed SSIMLayer is inherently nonlinear and hence, it does not require subsequent nonlinear transformations. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 benchmark demonstrates that the SSIMLayer provides better convergence than the traditional convolutional layer, bypasses the need for nonlinear transformations and shows more robustness against noise perturbations and adversarial attacks. 
### 483.Inferring Routing Preferences of Bicyclists from Sparse Sets of  Trajectories [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09158.pdf)
> Understanding the criteria that bicyclists apply when they choose their routes is crucial for planning new bicycle paths or recommending routes to bicyclists. This is becoming more and more important as city councils are becoming increasingly aware of limitations of the transport infrastructure and problems related to automobile traffic. Since different groups of cyclists have different preferences, however, searching for a single set of criteria is prone to failure. Therefore, in this paper, we present a new approach to classify trajectories recorded and shared by bicyclists into different groups and, for each group, to identify favored and unfavored road types. Based on these results we show how to assign weights to the edges of a graph representing the road network such that minimum-weight paths in the graph, which can be computed with standard shortest-path algorithms, correspond to adequate routes. Our method combines known algorithms for machine learning and the analysis of trajectories in an innovative way and, thereby, constitutes a new comprehensive solution for the problem of deriving routing preferences from initially unclassified trajectories. An important property of our method is that it yields reasonable results even if the given set of trajectories is sparse in the sense that it does not cover all segments of the cycle network. 
### 484.Fusion of complex networks and randomized neural networks for texture  analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09170.pdf)
> This paper presents a high discriminative texture analysis method based on the fusion of complex networks and randomized neural networks. In this approach, the input image is modeled as a complex networks and its topological properties as well as the image pixels are used to train randomized neural networks in order to create a signature that represents the deep characteristics of the texture. The results obtained surpassed the accuracies of many methods available in the literature. This performance demonstrates that our proposed approach opens a promising source of research, which consists of exploring the synergy of neural networks and complex networks in the texture analysis field. 
### 485.Dilated Temporal Fully-Convolutional Network for Semantic Segmentation  of Motion Capture Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09174.pdf)
> Semantic segmentation of motion capture sequences plays a key part in many data-driven motion synthesis frameworks. It is a preprocessing step in which long recordings of motion capture sequences are partitioned into smaller segments. Afterwards, additional methods like statistical modeling can be applied to each group of structurally-similar segments to learn an abstract motion manifold. The segmentation task however often remains a manual task, which increases the effort and cost of generating large-scale motion databases. We therefore propose an automatic framework for semantic segmentation of motion capture data using a dilated temporal fully-convolutional network. Our model outperforms a state-of-the-art model in action segmentation, as well as three networks for sequence modeling. We further show our model is robust against high noisy training labels. 
### 486.A Deeper Look at Power Normalizations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09183.pdf)
> Power Normalizations (PN) are very useful non-linear operators in the context of Bag-of-Words data representations as they tackle problems such as feature imbalance. In this paper, we reconsider these operators in the deep learning setup by introducing a novel layer that implements PN for non-linear pooling of feature maps. Specifically, by using a kernel formulation, our layer combines the feature vectors and their respective spatial locations in the feature maps produced by the last convolutional layer of CNN. Linearization of such a kernel results in a positive definite matrix capturing the second-order statistics of the feature vectors, to which PN operators are applied. We study two types of PN functions, namely (i) MaxExp and (ii) Gamma, addressing their role and meaning in the context of nonlinear pooling. We also provide a probabilistic interpretation of these operators and derive their surrogates with well-behaved gradients for end-to-end CNN learning. We apply our theory to practice by implementing the PN layer on a ResNet-50 model and showcase experiments on four benchmarks for fine-grained recognition, scene recognition, and material classification. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all these tasks. 
### 487.Detection based Defense against Adversarial Examples from the  Steganalysis Point ot View [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09186.pdf)
> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently led to significant improvements in many fields. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples which are samples with imperceptible perturbations while dramatically misleading the DNNs. Moreover, adversarial examples can be used to perform an attack on various kinds of DNN based systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model. Many defense methods have been proposed, such as obfuscating gradients of the networks or detecting adversarial examples. However it is proved out that these defense methods are not effective or cannot resist secondary adversarial attacks. In this paper, we point out that steganalysis can be applied to adversarial examples detection, and propose a method to enhance steganalysis features by estimating the probability of modifications caused by adversarial attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately detect adversarial examples. Moreover, secondary adversarial attacks cannot be directly performed to our method because our method is not based on a neural network but based on high-dimensional artificial features and FLD (Fisher Linear Discriminant) ensemble. 
### 488.Scale Space Approximation in Convolutional Neural Networks for Retinal  Vessel Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09230.pdf)
> Retinal images have the highest resolution and clarity among medical images. Thus, vessel analysis in retinal images may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of many chronic diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale residual convolutional neural network structure based on a \emph{scale-space approximation (SSA)} block of layers, comprising subsampling and subsequent upsampling, for multi-scale representation. Through analysis in the frequency domain, we show that this block structure is a close approximation of Gaussian filtering, the operation to achieve scale variations in scale-space theory. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed network outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Ablative analysis shows that the SSA is indeed an important factor in performance improvement. 
### 489.FBI-Pose: Towards Bridging the Gap between 2D Images and 3D Human Poses  using Forward-or-Backward Information [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09241.pdf)
> Although significant advances have been made in the area of human poses estimation from images using deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet), it remains a big challenge to perform 3D pose inference in-the-wild. This is due to the difficulty to obtain 3D pose groundtruth for outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to tackle this problem by exploiting the information of each bone indicating if it is forward or backward with respect to the view of the camera(we term it Forwardor-Backward Information abbreviated as FBI). Our method firstly trains a ConvNet with two branches which maps an image of a human to both the 2D joint locations and the FBI of bones. These information is further fed into a deep regression network to predict the 3D positions of joints. To support the training, we also develop an annotation user interface and labeled such FBI for around 12K in-the-wild images which are randomly selected from MPII (a public dataset of 2D pose annotation). Our experimental results on the standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
### 490.PILOT: A Pixel Intensity Driven Illuminant Color Estimation Framework  for Color Constancy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09248.pdf)
> In this study, a CNN based Pixel Intensity driven iLluminant cOlor esTimation framework, PILOT, is proposed. The framework consists of a local illuminant estimation module and an illuminant uncertainty prediction module, obtained using a 3-phase training approach. The network with the well-designed microarchitecture of distillation building block and the macroarchitecture of bifurcated organization is of great representational capacity and efficacy for color-relevant vision tasks, which helps obtain a &gt;20% relative improvement over prior algorithms and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy of illuminant estimation on benchmark datasets. The proposed framework is also computationally efficient and parameter-economic, making it suitable for applications deployed on mobile platforms. The great interpretability also makes PILOT possible to serve as a guidance for designing statistics-based models for those low-end devices with tight budgets of power consumption and computational capacity. 
### 491.Best Vision Technologies Submission to ActivityNet Challenge 2018-Task:  Dense-Captioning Events in Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09278.pdf)
> This note describes the details of our solution to the dense-captioning events in videos task of ActivityNet Challenge 2018. Specifically, we solve this problem with a two-stage way, i.e., first temporal event proposal and then sentence generation. For temporal event proposal, we directly leverage the three-stage workflow in [13, 16]. For sentence generation, we capitalize on LSTM-based captioning framework with temporal attention mechanism (dubbed as LSTM-T). Moreover, the input visual sequence to the LSTM-based video captioning model is comprised of RGB and optical flow images. At inference, we adopt a late fusion scheme to fuse the two LSTM-based captioning models for sentence generation. 
### 492.RAM: A Region-Aware Deep Model for Vehicle Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09283.pdf)
> Previous works on vehicle Re-ID mainly focus on extracting global features and learning distance metrics. Because some vehicles commonly share same model and maker, it is hard to distinguish them based on their global appearances. Compared with the global appearance, local regions such as decorations and inspection stickers attached to the windshield, may be more distinctive for vehicle Re-ID. To embed the detailed visual cues in those local regions, we propose a Region-Aware deep Model (RAM). Specifically, in addition to extracting global features, RAM also extracts features from a series of local regions. As each local region conveys more distinctive visual cues, RAM encourages the deep model to learn discriminative features. We also introduce a novel learning algorithm to jointly use vehicle IDs, types/models, and colors to train the RAM. This strategy fuses more cues for training and results in more discriminative global and regional features. We evaluate our methods on two large-scale vehicle Re-ID datasets, i.e., VeRi and VehicleID. Experimental results show our methods achieve promising performance in comparison with recent works. 
### 493.Vision-based Pose Estimation for Augmented Reality : A Comparison Study [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09316.pdf)
> Augmented reality aims to enrich our real world by inserting 3D virtual objects. In order to accomplish this goal, it is important that virtual elements are rendered and aligned in the real scene in an accurate and visually acceptable way. The solution of this problem can be related to a pose estimation and 3D camera localization. This paper presents a survey on different approaches of 3D pose estimation in augmented reality and gives classification of key-points-based techniques. The study given in this paper may help both developers and researchers in the field of augmented reality. 
### 494.Sparse 3D Point-cloud Map Upsampling and Noise Removal as a vSLAM  Post-processing Step: Experimental Evaluation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09346.pdf)
> The monocular vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) is one of the most challenging problem in mobile robotics and computer vision. In this work we study the post-processing techniques applied to sparse 3D point-cloud maps, obtained by feature-based vSLAM algorithms. Map post-processing is split into 2 major steps: 1) noise and outlier removal and 2) upsampling. We evaluate different combinations of known algorithms for outlier removing and upsampling on datasets of real indoor and outdoor environments and identify the most promising combination. We further use it to convert a point-cloud map, obtained by the real UAV performing indoor flight to 3D voxel grid (octo-map) potentially suitable for path planning. 
### 495.Exploring Adversarial Examples: Patterns of One-Pixel Attacks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09410.pdf)
> Failure cases of black-box deep learning, e.g. adversarial examples, might have severe consequences in healthcare. Yet such failures are mostly studied in the context of real-world images with calibrated attacks. To demystify the adversarial examples, rigorous studies need to be designed. Unfortunately, complexity of the medical images hinders such study design directly from the medical images. We hypothesize that adversarial examples might result from the incorrect mapping of image space to the low dimensional generation manifold by deep networks. To test the hypothesis, we simplify a complex medical problem namely pose estimation of surgical tools into its barest form. An analytical decision boundary and exhaustive search of the one-pixel attack across multiple image dimensions let us localize the regions of frequent successful one-pixel attacks at the image space. 
### 496.A Unified Model with Structured Output for Fashion Images Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09445.pdf)
> A picture is worth a thousand words. Albeit a clich\'e, for the fashion industry, an image of a clothing piece allows one to perceive its category (e.g., dress), sub-category (e.g., day dress) and properties (e.g., white colour with floral patterns). The seasonal nature of the fashion industry creates a highly dynamic and creative domain with evermore data, making it unpractical to manually describe a large set of images (of products). In this paper, we explore the concept of visual recognition for fashion images through an end-to-end architecture embedding the hierarchical nature of the annotations directly into the model. Towards that goal, and inspired by the work of [7], we have modified and adapted the original architecture proposal. Namely, we have removed the message passing layer symmetry to cope with Farfetch category tree, added extra layers for hierarchy level specificity, and moved the message passing layer into an enriched latent space. We compare the proposed unified architecture against state-of-the-art models and demonstrate the performance advantage of our model for structured multi-level categorization on a dataset of about 350k fashion product images. 
### 497.Semi-Automatic RECIST Labeling on CT Scans with Cascaded Convolutional  Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09507.pdf)
> Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) is the standard measurement for tumor extent to evaluate treatment responses in cancer patients. As such, RECIST annotations must be accurate. However, RECIST annotations manually labeled by radiologists require professional knowledge and are time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inconsistency among different observers. To alleviate these problems, we propose a cascaded convolutional neural network based method to semi-automatically label RECIST annotations and drastically reduce annotation time. The proposed method consists of two stages: lesion region normalization and RECIST estimation. We employ the spatial transformer network (STN) for lesion region normalization, where a localization network is designed to predict the lesion region and the transformation parameters with a multi-task learning strategy. For RECIST estimation, we adapt the stacked hourglass network (SHN), introducing a relationship constraint loss to improve the estimation precision. STN and SHN can both be learned in an end-to-end fashion. We train our system on the DeepLesion dataset, obtaining a consensus model trained on RECIST annotations performed by multiple radiologists over a multi-year period. Importantly, when judged against the inter-reader variability of two additional radiologist raters, our system performs more stably and with less variability, suggesting that RECIST annotations can be reliably obtained with reduced labor and time. 
### 498.Self-supervised Learning for Dense Depth Estimation in Monocular  Endoscopy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09521.pdf)
> We present a self-supervised approach to training convolutional neural networks for dense depth estimation from monocular endoscopy data without a priori modeling of anatomy or shading. Our method only requires sequential data from monocular endoscopic videos and a multi-view stereo reconstruction method, e.g. structure from motion, that supervises learning in a sparse but accurate manner. Consequently, our method requires neither manual interaction, such as scaling or labeling, nor patient CT in the training and application phases. We demonstrate the performance of our method on sinus endoscopy data from two patients and validate depth prediction quantitatively using corresponding patient CT scans where we found submillimeter residual errors. 
### 499.SkinNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Skin Lesion Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09522.pdf)
> There has been a steady increase in the incidence of skin cancer worldwide, with a high rate of mortality. Early detection and segmentation of skin lesions are crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment, necessary to improve the survival rate of patients. However, skin lesion segmentation is a challenging task due to the low contrast of lesions and their high similarity in terms of appearance, to healthy tissue. This underlines the need for an accurate and automatic approach for skin lesion segmentation. To tackle this issue, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) called SkinNet. The proposed CNN is a modified version of U-Net. We compared the performance of our approach with other state-of-the-art techniques, using the ISBI 2017 challenge dataset. Our approach outperformed the others in terms of the Dice coefficient, Jaccard index and sensitivity, evaluated on the held-out challenge test data set, across 5-fold cross validation experiments. SkinNet achieved an average value of 85.10, 76.67 and 93.0%, for the DC, JI, and SE, respectively. 
### 500.IR2VI: Enhanced Night Environmental Perception by Unsupervised Thermal  Image Translation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09565.pdf)
> Context enhancement is critical for night vision (NV) applications, especially for the dark night situation without any artificial lights. In this paper, we present the infrared-to-visual (IR2VI) algorithm, a novel unsupervised thermal-to-visible image translation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). IR2VI is able to learn the intrinsic characteristics from VI images and integrate them into IR images. Since the existing unsupervised GAN-based image translation approaches face several challenges, such as incorrect mapping and lack of fine details, we propose a structure connection module and a region-of-interest (ROI) focal loss method to address the current limitations. Experimental results show the superiority of the IR2VI algorithm over baseline methods. 
### 501.Learning Single-Image Depth from Videos using Quality Assessment  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09573.pdf)
> Although significant progress has been made in recent years, depth estimation from a single image in the wild is still a very challenging problem. One reason is the lack of high-quality image-depth data in the wild. In this paper we propose a fully automatic pipeline based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to generate such data from arbitrary videos. The core of this pipeline is a Quality Assessment Network that can distinguish correct and incorrect reconstructions obtained from SfM. With the proposed pipeline, we generate image-depth data from the NYU Depth dataset and random YouTube videos. We show that depth-prediction networks trained on such data can achieve competitive performance on the NYU Depth and the Depth-in-the-Wild benchmarks. 
### 502.Tracking Emerges by Colorizing Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09594.pdf)
> We use large amounts of unlabeled video to learn models for visual tracking without manual human supervision. We leverage the natural temporal coherency of color to create a model that learns to colorize gray-scale videos by copying colors from a reference frame. Quantitative and qualitative experiments suggest that this task causes the model to automatically learn to track visual regions. Although the model is trained without any ground-truth labels, our method learns to track well enough to outperform the latest methods based on optical flow. Moreover, our results suggest that failures to track are correlated with failures to colorize, indicating that advancing video colorization may further improve self-supervised visual tracking. 
### 503.A Machine-learning framework for automatic reference-free quality  assessment in MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09602.pdf)
> Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging offers a wide variety of imaging techniques. A large amount of data is created per examination which needs to be checked for sufficient quality in order to derive a meaningful diagnosis. This is a manual process and therefore time- and cost-intensive. Any imaging artifacts originating from scanner hardware, signal processing or induced by the patient may reduce the image quality and complicate the diagnosis or any image post-processing. Therefore, the assessment or the ensurance of sufficient image quality in an automated manner is of high interest. Usually no reference image is available or difficult to define. Therefore, classical reference-based approaches are not applicable. Model observers mimicking the human observers (HO) can assist in this task. Thus, we propose a new machine-learning-based reference-free MR image quality assessment framework which is trained on HO-derived labels to assess MR image quality immediately after each acquisition. We include the concept of active learning and present an efficient blinded reading platform to reduce the effort in the HO labeling procedure. Derived image features and the applied classifiers (support-vector-machine, deep neural network) are investigated for a cohort of 250 patients. The MR image quality assessment framework can achieve a high test accuracy of 93.7$\%$ for estimating quality classes on a 5-point Likert-scale. The proposed MR image quality assessment framework is able to provide an accurate and efficient quality estimation which can be used as a prospective quality assurance including automatic acquisition adaptation or guided MR scanner operation, and/or as a retrospective quality assessment including support of diagnostic decisions or quality control in cohort studies. 
### 504.Multi-Exposure Image Fusion Based on Exposure Compensation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09607.pdf)
> This paper proposes a novel multi-exposure image fusion method based on exposure compensation. Multi-exposure image fusion is a method to produce images without color saturation regions, by using photos with different exposures. However, in conventional works, it is unclear how to determine appropriate exposure values, and moreover, it is difficult to set appropriate exposure values at the time of photographing due to time constraints. In the proposed method, the luminance of the input multi-exposure images is adjusted on the basis of the relationship between exposure values and pixel values, where the relationship is obtained by assuming that a digital camera has a linear response function. The use of a local contrast enhancement method is also considered to improve input multi-exposure images. The compensated images are finally combined by one of existing multi-exposure image fusion methods. In some experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method are evaluated in terms of the tone mapped image quality index, statistical naturalness, and discrete entropy, by comparing the proposed one with conventional ones. 
### 505.Attention-based Few-Shot Person Re-identification Using Meta Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09613.pdf)
> In this paper, we investigate the challenging task of person re-identification from a new perspective and propose an end-to-end attention-based architecture for few-shot re-identification through meta-learning. The motivation for this task lies in the fact that humans, can usually identify another person after just seeing that given person a few times (or even once) by attending to their memory. On the other hand, the unique nature of the person re-identification problem, i.e., only few examples exist per identity and new identities always appearing during testing, calls for a few shot learning architecture with the capacity of handling new identities. Hence, we frame the problem within a meta-learning setting, where a neural network based meta-learner is trained to optimize a learner i.e., an attention-based matching function. Another challenge of the person re-identification problem is the small inter-class difference between different identities and large intra-class difference of the same identity. In order to increase the discriminative power of the model, we propose a new attention-based feature encoding scheme that takes into account the critical intra-view and cross-view relationship of images. We refer to the proposed Attention-based Re-identification Metalearning model as ARM. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the advantages of the ARM as compared to the state-of-the-art on the challenging PRID2011, CUHK01, CUHK03 and Market1501 datasets. 
### 506.3D Context Enhanced Region-based Convolutional Neural Network for  End-to-End Lesion Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09648.pdf)
> Detecting lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is an important but difficult problem because non-lesions and true lesions can appear similar. 3D context is known to be helpful in this differentiation task. However, existing end-to-end detection frameworks of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are mostly designed for 2D images. In this paper, we propose 3D context enhanced region-based CNN (3DCE) to incorporate 3D context information efficiently by aggregating feature maps of 2D images. 3DCE is easy to train and end-to-end in training and inference. A universal lesion detector is developed to detect all kinds of lesions in one algorithm using the DeepLesion dataset. Experimental results on this challenging task prove the effectiveness of 3DCE. We have released the code of 3DCE in <a href="https://github.com/rsummers11/CADLab/tree/master/lesion_detector_3DCE.">this https URL</a> 
### 507.Person Re-Identification in Identity Regression Space [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09695.pdf)
> Most existing person re-identification (re-id) methods are unsuitable for real-world deployment due to two reasons: Unscalability to large population size, and Inadaptability over time. In this work, we present a unified solution to address both problems. Specifically, we propose to construct an Identity Regression Space (IRS) based on embedding different training person identities (classes) and formulate re-id as a regression problem solved by identity regression in the IRS. The IRS approach is characterised by a closed-form solution with high learning efficiency and an inherent incremental learning capability with human-in-the-loop. Extensive experiments on four benchmarking datasets(VIPeR, CUHK01, CUHK03 and Market-1501) show that the IRS model not only outperforms state-of-the-art re-id methods, but also is more scalable to large re-id population size by rapidly updating model and actively selecting informative samples with reduced human labelling effort. 
### 508.Cycle Consistent Adversarial Denoising Network for Multiphase Coronary  CT Angiography [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09748.pdf)
> In coronary CT angiography, a series of CT images are taken at different levels of radiation dose during the examination. Although this reduces the total radiation dose, the image quality during the low-dose phases is significantly degraded. To address this problem, here we propose a novel semi-supervised learning technique that can remove the noises of the CT images obtained in the low-dose phases by learning from the CT images in the routine dose phases. Although a supervised learning approach is not possible due to the differences in the underlying heart structure in two phases, the images in the two phases are closely related so that we propose a cycle-consistent adversarial denoising network to learn the non-degenerate mapping between the low and high dose cardiac phases. Experimental results showed that the proposed method effectively reduces the noise in the low-dose CT image while the preserving detailed texture and edge information. Moreover, thanks to the cyclic consistency and identity loss, the proposed network does not create any artificial features that are not present in the input images. Visual grading and quality evaluation also confirm that the proposed method provides significant improvement in diagnostic quality. 
### 509.Syn2Real: A New Benchmark forSynthetic-to-Real Visual Domain Adaptation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09755.pdf)
> Unsupervised transfer of object recognition models from synthetic to real data is an important problem with many potential applications. The challenge is how to "adapt" a model trained on simulated images so that it performs well on real-world data without any additional supervision. Unfortunately, current benchmarks for this problem are limited in size and task diversity. In this paper, we present a new large-scale benchmark called Syn2Real, which consists of a synthetic domain rendered from 3D object models and two real-image domains containing the same object categories. We define three related tasks on this benchmark: closed-set object classification, open-set object classification, and object detection. Our evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art methods reveals a large gap in adaptation performance between the easier closed-set classification task and the more difficult open-set and detection tasks. We conclude that developing adaptation methods that work well across all three tasks presents a significant future challenge for syn2real domain transfer. 
### 510.Simultaneous Segmentation and Classification of Bone Surfaces from  Ultrasound Using a Multi-feature Guided CNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09766.pdf)
> Various imaging artifacts, low signal-to-noise ratio, and bone surfaces appearing several millimeters in thickness have hindered the success of ultrasound (US) guided computer assisted orthopedic surgery procedures. In this work, a multi-feature guided convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed for simultaneous enhancement, segmentation, and classification of bone surfaces from US data. The proposed CNN consists of two main parts: a pre-enhancing net, that takes the concatenation of B-mode US scan and three filtered image features for the enhancement of bone surfaces, and a modified U-net with a classification layer. The proposed method was validated on 650 in vivo US scans collected using two US machines, by scanning knee, femur, distal radius and tibia bones. Validation, against expert annotation, achieved statistically significant improvements in segmentation of bone surfaces compared to state-of-the-art. 
### 511.Cross-position Activity Recognition with Stratified Transfer Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09776.pdf)
> Human activity recognition aims to recognize the activities of daily living by utilizing the sensors on different body parts. However, when the labeled data from a certain body position (i.e. target domain) is missing, how to leverage the data from other positions (i.e. source domain) to help learn the activity labels of this position? When there are several source domains available, it is often difficult to select the most similar source domain to the target domain. With the selected source domain, we need to perform accurate knowledge transfer between domains. Existing methods only learn the global distance between domains while ignoring the local property. In this paper, we propose a \textit{Stratified Transfer Learning} (STL) framework to perform both source domain selection and knowledge transfer. STL is based on our proposed \textit{Stratified} distance to capture the local property of domains. STL consists of two components: Stratified Domain Selection (STL-SDS) can select the most similar source domain to the target domain; Stratified Activity Transfer (STL-SAT) is able to perform accurate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three public activity recognition datasets demonstrate the superiority of STL. Furthermore, we extensively investigate the performance of transfer learning across different degrees of similarities and activity levels between domains. We also discuss the potential applications of STL in other fields of pervasive computing for future research. 
### 512.CFENet: An Accurate and Efficient Single-Shot Object Detector for  Autonomous Driving [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09790.pdf)
> The ability to detect small objects and the speed of the object detector are very important for the application of autonomous driving, and in this paper, we propose an effective yet efficient one-stage detector, which gained the second place in the Road Object Detection competition of CVPR2018 workshop - Workshop of Autonomous Driving(WAD). The proposed detector inherits the architecture of SSD and introduces a novel Comprehensive Feature Enhancement(CFE) module into it. Experimental results on this competition dataset as well as the MSCOCO dataset demonstrate that the proposed detector (named CFENet) performs much better than the original SSD and the state-of-the-art method RefineDet especially for small objects, while keeping high efficiency close to the original SSD. Specifically, the single scale version of the proposed detector can run at the speed of 21 fps, while the multi-scale version with larger input size achieves the mAP 29.69, ranking second on the leaderboard 
### 513.SuperPCA: A Superpixelwise PCA Approach for Unsupervised Feature  Extraction of Hyperspectral Imagery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09807.pdf)
> As an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method, principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely considered as an efficient and effective preprocessing step for hyperspectral image (HSI) processing and analysis tasks. It takes each band as a whole and globally extracts the most representative bands. However, different homogeneous regions correspond to different objects, whose spectral features are diverse. It is obviously inappropriate to carry out dimensionality reduction through a unified projection for an entire HSI. In this paper, a simple but very effective superpixelwise PCA approach, called SuperPCA, is proposed to learn the intrinsic low-dimensional features of HSIs. In contrast to classical PCA models, SuperPCA has four main properties. (1) Unlike the traditional PCA method based on a whole image, SuperPCA takes into account the diversity in different homogeneous regions, that is, different regions should have different projections. (2) Most of the conventional feature extraction models cannot directly use the spatial information of HSIs, while SuperPCA is able to incorporate the spatial context information into the unsupervised dimensionality reduction by superpixel segmentation. (3) Since the regions obtained by superpixel segmentation have homogeneity, SuperPCA can extract potential low-dimensional features even under noise. (4) Although SuperPCA is an unsupervised method, it can achieve competitive performance when compared with supervised approaches. The resulting features are discriminative, compact, and noise resistant, leading to improved HSI classification performance. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the SuperPCA model significantly outperforms the conventional PCA based dimensionality reduction baselines for HSI classification.

### 514.Generating Counterfactual Explanations with Natural Language [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09809.pdf)
> Natural language explanations of deep neural network decisions provide an intuitive way for a AI agent to articulate a reasoning process. Current textual explanations learn to discuss class discriminative features in an image. However, it is also helpful to understand which attributes might change a classification decision if present in an image (e.g., "This is not a Scarlet Tanager because it does not have black wings.") We call such textual explanations counterfactual explanations, and propose an intuitive method to generate counterfactual explanations by inspecting which evidence in an input is missing, but might contribute to a different classification decision if present in the image. To demonstrate our method we consider a fine-grained image classification task in which we take as input an image and a counterfactual class and output text which explains why the image does not belong to a counterfactual class. We then analyze our generated counterfactual explanations both qualitatively and quantitatively using proposed automatic metrics. 
### 515.Visually-Aware Personalized Recommendation using Interpretable Image  Representations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09820.pdf)
> Visually-aware recommender systems use visual signals present in the underlying data to model the visual characteristics of items and users' preferences towards them. In the domain of clothing recommendation, incorporating items' visual information (e.g., product images) is particularly important since clothing item appearance is often a critical factor in influencing the user's purchasing decisions. Current state-of-the-art visually-aware recommender systems utilize image features extracted from pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks, however these extremely high-dimensional representations are difficult to interpret, especially in relation to the relatively low number of visual properties that may guide users' decisions. <br />In this paper we propose a novel approach to personalized clothing recommendation that models the dynamics of individual users' visual preferences. By using interpretable image representations generated with a unique feature learning process, our model learns to explain users' prior feedback in terms of their affinity towards specific visual attributes and styles. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on personalized ranking tasks, and the incorporation of interpretable visual features allows for powerful model introspection, which we demonstrate by using an interactive recommendation algorithm and visualizing the rise and fall of fashion trends over time. 
### 516.Multi-Task Deep Convolutional Neural Network for the Segmentation of  Type B Aortic Dissection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09860.pdf)
> Type B aortic dissection (TBAD) is a rare but life threatening disease. Segmentation of the entire aorta and truefalse lumen is crucial for the planning and follow-up of endovascular repair of TBAD. Manual segmentation in a slice-wise manner is time-consuming and requires expert experience. Current computer-aided methods have several limitations like focusing only on a specific part oftheaorta atatimeorrequiringhumaninteraction. Mostimportantly, these methods can not segment the entire aorta and detect true-false lumen at the same time. We report in this study a fully automatic approach based on multi-task deep convolutional neural network that segments the entire aorta and true-false lumen fromCTA images in a unified framework. Fortraining,webuiltadatabasecontaining254CTA images from both pre-operative and post-operative TBAD patients. These images are from multiple manufacturers. Slice-wise manual segmentation of the entire aorta and the true-false lumen for each 3-D CTA image is also provided. Our method is evaluated on 16 CTA data (11 preoperative and 5 postoperative) whose ground truth segmentation is provided by experienced vascular surgeons.Resultsshow that our method can segment type B aortic dissection with robustness and accuracy. Furthermore,our method can be easily extended to the segmentation of the entire aorta without dissection. 
### 517.Multi-modal Image Processing based on Coupled Dictionary Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09882.pdf)
> In real-world scenarios, many data processing problems often involve heterogeneous images associated with different imaging modalities. Since these multimodal images originate from the same phenomenon, it is realistic to assume that they share common attributes or characteristics. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal image processing framework based on coupled dictionary learning to capture similarities and disparities between different image modalities. In particular, our framework can capture favorable structure similarities across different image modalities such as edges, corners, and other elementary primitives in a learned sparse transform domain, instead of the original pixel domain, that can be used to improve a number of image processing tasks such as denoising, inpainting, or super-resolution. Practical experiments demonstrate that incorporating multimodal information using our framework brings notable benefits. 
### 518.AirLab: Autograd Image Registration Laboratory [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09907.pdf)
> Medical image registration is an active research topic and forms a basis for many medical image analysis tasks. Although image registration is a rather general concept specialized methods are usually required to target a specific registration problem. The development and implementation of such methods has been tough so far as the gradient of the objective has to be computed. Also, its evaluation has to be performed preferably on a GPU for larger images and for more complex transformation models and regularization terms. This hinders researchers from rapid prototyping and poses hurdles to reproduce research results. There is a clear need for an environment which hides this complexity to put the modeling and the experimental exploration of registration methods into the foreground. With the "Autograd Image Registration Laboratory" (AirLab), we introduce an open laboratory for image registration tasks, where the analytic gradients of the objective function are computed automatically and the device where the computations are performed, on a CPU or a GPU, is transparent. It is meant as a laboratory for researchers and developers enabling them to rapidly try out new ideas for registering images and to reproduce registration results which have already been published. AirLab is implemented in Python using PyTorch as tensor and optimization library and SimpleITK for basic image IO. Therefore, it profits from recent advances made by the machine learning community concerning optimization and deep neural network models. <br />The present draft of this paper roughly outlines AirLab with first code snippets and performance analyses. A more exhaustive introduction will follow as a final version soon. 
### 519.Coupled Dictionary Learning for Multi-contrast MRI Reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09930.pdf)
> Medical imaging tasks often involve multiple contrasts, such as T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. These contrasts capture information associated with the same underlying anatomy and thus exhibit similarities. In this paper, we propose a Coupled Dictionary Learning based multi-contrast MRI reconstruction (CDLMRI) approach to leverage an available guidance contrast to restore the target contrast. Our approach consists of three stages: coupled dictionary learning, coupled sparse denoising, and $k$-space consistency enforcing. The first stage learns a group of dictionaries that capture correlations among multiple contrasts. By capitalizing on the learned adaptive dictionaries, the second stage performs joint sparse coding to denoise the corrupted target image with the aid of a guidance contrast. The third stage enforces consistency between the denoised image and the measurements in the $k$-space domain. Numerical experiments on the retrospective under-sampling of clinical MR images demonstrate that incorporating additional guidance contrast via our design improves MRI reconstruction, compared to state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 520.Online Signature Verification using Deep Representation: A new  Descriptor [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09986.pdf)
> This paper presents an accurate method for verifying online signatures. The main difficulty of signature verification come from: (1) Lacking enough training samples (2) The methods must be spatial change invariant. To deal with these difficulties and modeling the signatures efficiently, we propose a method that a one-class classifier per each user is built on discriminative features. First, we pre-train a sparse auto-encoder using a large number of unlabeled signatures, then we applied the discriminative features, which are learned by auto-encoder to represent the training and testing signatures as a self-thought learning method (i.e. we have introduced a signature descriptor). Finally, user's signatures are modeled and classified using a one-class classifier. The proposed method is independent on signature datasets thanks to self-taught learning. The experimental results indicate significant error reduction and accuracy enhancement in comparison with state-of-the-art methods on SVC2004 and SUSIG datasets. 
### 521.Crowd Counting with Density Adaption Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10040.pdf)
> Crowd counting is one of the core tasks in various surveillance applications. A practical system involves estimating accurate head counts in dynamic scenarios under different lightning, camera perspective and occlusion states. Previous approaches estimate head counts despite that they can vary dramatically in different density settings; the crowd is often unevenly distributed and the results are therefore unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework that can automatically estimate the crowd density level and adaptively choose between different counter networks that are explicitly trained for different density domains. Experiments on two recent crowd counting datasets, UCF_CC_50 and ShanghaiTech, show that the proposed mechanism achieves promising improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, runtime speed is 20 FPS on a single GPU. 
### 522.Multi-Mapping Image-to-Image Translation with Central Biasing  Normalization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10050.pdf)
> Recently, image-to-image translation tasks have been attempting to extend the model from one-to-one mapping to multiple mappings by injecting latent code. Through the analysis of the existing latent code injection models, we find that latent code can determine the target mapping of a generator by controlling the output statistical properties, especially the mean value. However, we find that in some cases the normalization will reduce the consistency of same mapping or the diversity of different mappings. After mathematical analysis, we find the reason behind that is that the distributions of same mapping become inconsistent after batch normalization, and that the effects of latent code are eliminated after instance normalization. To solve these problems, we propose the consistency within diversity design criteria for multi-mapping networks. Based on the design criteria, we propose central biasing normalization to replace existing latent code injection. Experiments show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code and pretrained models are available at <a href="https://github.com/Xiaoming-Yu/cbn">this https URL</a> . 
### 523.Leveraging Disease Progression Learning for Medical Image Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10128.pdf)
> Unlike natural images, medical images often have intrinsic characteristics that can be leveraged for neural network learning. For example, images that belong to different stages of a disease may continuously follow a certain progression pattern. In this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages disease progression learning for medical image recognition. In our method, sequences of images ordered by disease stages are learned by a neural network that consists of a shared vision model for feature extraction and a long short-term memory network for the learning of stage sequences. Auxiliary vision outputs are also included to capture stage features that tend to be discrete along the disease progression. Our proposed method is evaluated on a public diabetic retinopathy dataset, and achieves about 3.3% improvement in disease staging accuracy, compared to the baseline method that does not use disease progression learning. 
### 524.Detection of Alzheimers Disease from MRI using Convolutional Neural  Network with Tensorflow [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10170.pdf)
> Nowadays, due to tremendous improvements in high performance computing, it has become easier to train Neural Networks. We intend to take advantage of this situation and apply this technology in solving real world problems. There was a need for automatic diagnosis certain diseases from medical images that could help a doctor and radiologist for further action towards treating the illness. We chose Alzheimer disease for this purpose. Alzheimer disease is the leading cause of dementia and memory loss. Alzheimer disease, it is caused by atrophy of the certain brain regions and by brain cell death. MRI scans reveal this information but atrophy regions are different for different people which makes the diagnosis a little trickier and often gets miss-diagnosed by doctors and radiologists. The Dataset used for this project is provided by OASIS, which contains over 400 subjects 100 of which having mild to severe dementia and is supplemented by MMSE and CDR standards of diagnosis in the same context. Enter CNN, Convolutional Neural Networks are a hybrid of Kernel Convolutions and Neural Networks. Kernel Convolutions is a technique that uses filters to recognize and segment images based on features. Neural Networks consist of neurons which are loosely based on human brains neuron which represents a single classifier and interconnected by weights, have different biases and are activated by some activation functions. By using Convolutional Neural Networks, the problem can be solved with minimal error rate. The technologies we intend to use are libraries like CUDA CuDNN for making use of GPU and its multiple cores-parallel computing to train models while giving us high performance. 
### 525.Learning a Saliency Evaluation Metric Using Crowdsourced Perceptual  Judgments [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10257.pdf)
> In the area of human fixation prediction, dozens of computational saliency models are proposed to reveal certain saliency characteristics under different assumptions and definitions. As a result, saliency model benchmarking often requires several evaluation metrics to simultaneously assess saliency models from multiple perspectives. However, most computational metrics are not designed to directly measure the perceptual similarity of saliency maps so that the evaluation results may be sometimes inconsistent with the subjective impression. To address this problem, this paper first conducts extensive subjective tests to find out how the visual similarities between saliency maps are perceived by humans. Based on the crowdsourced data collected in these tests, we conclude several key factors in assessing saliency maps and quantize the performance of existing metrics. Inspired by these factors, we propose to learn a saliency evaluation metric based on a two-stream convolutional neural network using crowdsourced perceptual judgements. Specifically, the relative saliency score of each pair from the crowdsourced data is utilized to regularize the network during the training process. By capturing the key factors shared by various subjects in comparing saliency maps, the learned metric better aligns with human perception of saliency maps, making it a good complement to the existing metrics. Experimental results validate that the learned metric can be generalized to the comparisons of saliency maps from new images, new datasets, new models and synthetic data. Due to the effectiveness of the learned metric, it also can be used to facilitate the development of new models for fixation prediction. 
### 526.Collaborative Annotation of Semantic Objects in Images with  Multi-granularity Supervisions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10269.pdf)
> Per-pixel masks of semantic objects are very useful in many applications, which, however, are tedious to be annotated. In this paper, we propose a human-agent collaborative annotation approach that can efficiently generate per-pixel masks of semantic objects in tagged images with multi-granularity supervisions. Given a set of tagged image, a computer agent is first dynamically generated to roughly localize the semantic objects described by the tag. The agent first extracts massive object proposals from an image and then infer the tag-related ones under the weak and strong supervisions from linguistically and visually similar images and previously annotated object masks. By representing such supervisions by over-complete dictionaries, the tag-related object proposals can pop-out according to their sparse coding length, which are then converted to superpixels with binary labels. After that, human annotators participate in the annotation process by flipping labels and dividing superpixels with mouse clicks, which are used as click supervisions that teach the agent to recover false positives/negatives in processing images with the same tags. Experimental results show that our approach can facilitate the annotation process and generate object masks that are highly consistent with those generated by the LabelMe toolbox. 
### 527.Primary Object Segmentation in Aerial Videos via Hierarchical Temporal  Slicing and Co-Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10274.pdf)
> Primary object segmentation plays an important role in understanding videos generated by unmanned aerial vehicles. In this paper, we propose a large-scale dataset APD with 500 aerial videos, in which the primary objects are manually annotated on 5,014 sparsely sampled frames. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest dataset to date for the task of primary object segmentation in aerial videos. From this dataset, we find that most aerial videos contain large-scale scenes, small sized primary objects as well as consistently varying scales and viewpoints. Inspired by that, we propose a novel hierarchical temporal slicing approach that repeatedly divides a video into two sub-videos formed by the odd and even frames, respectively. In this manner, an aerial video can be represented by a set of hierarchically organized short video clips, and the primary objects they share can be segmented by training end-to-end co-segmentation CNNs and finally refined within the neighborhood reversible flows. Experimental results show that our approach remarkably outperforms 24 state-of-the-art methods in segmenting primary objects in various types of aerial videos. 
### 528.Feature-less Stitching of Cylindrical Tunnel [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10278.pdf)
> Traditional image stitching algorithms use transforms such as homography to combine different views of a scene. They usually work well when the scene is planar or when the camera is only rotated, keeping its position static. This severely limits their use in real world scenarios where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) potentially hovers around and flies in an enclosed area while rotating to capture a video sequence. We utilize known scene geometry along with recorded camera trajectory to create cylindrical images captured in a given environment such as a tunnel where the camera rotates around its center. The captured images of the inner surface of the given scene are combined to create a composite panoramic image that is textured onto a 3D geometrical object in Unity graphical engine to create an immersive environment for end users. 
### 529.Attention to Head Locations for Crowd Counting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10287.pdf)
> Occlusions, complex backgrounds, scale variations and non-uniform distributions present great challenges for crowd counting in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method using an attention model to exploit head locations which are the most important cue for crowd counting. The attention model estimates a probability map in which high probabilities indicate locations where heads are likely to be present. The estimated probability map is used to suppress non-head regions in feature maps from several multi-scale feature extraction branches of a convolution neural network for crowd density estimation, which makes our method robust to complex backgrounds, scale variations and non-uniform distributions. In addition, we introduce a relative deviation loss to compensate a commonly used training loss, Euclidean distance, to improve the accuracy of sparse crowd density estimation. Experiments on Shanghai-Tech, UCF_CC_50 and World-Expo'10 data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 
### 530.Exploiting Spatial-Temporal Modelling and Multi-Modal Fusion for Human  Action Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10319.pdf)
> In this report, our approach to tackling the task of ActivityNet 2018 Kinetics-600 challenge is described in detail. Though spatial-temporal modelling methods, which adopt either such end-to-end framework as I3D \cite{i3d} or two-stage frameworks (i.e., CNN+RNN), have been proposed in existing state-of-the-arts for this task, video modelling is far from being well solved. In this challenge, we propose spatial-temporal network (StNet) for better joint spatial-temporal modelling and comprehensively video understanding. Besides, given that multi-modal information is contained in video source, we manage to integrate both early-fusion and later-fusion strategy of multi-modal information via our proposed improved temporal Xception network (iTXN) for video understanding. Our StNet RGB single model achieves 78.99\% top-1 precision in the Kinetics-600 validation set and that of our improved temporal Xception network which integrates RGB, flow and audio modalities is up to 82.35\%. After model ensemble, we achieve top-1 precision as high as 85.0\% on the validation set and rank No.1 among all submissions. 
### 531.3D RoI-aware U-Net for Accurate and Efficient Colorectal Tumor  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10342.pdf)
> Segmentation of colorectal cancerous regions from Magnetic Resonance (MR) images is a crucial procedure for radiotherapy which conventionally requires accurate delineation of tumour boundaries at an expense of labor, time and reproducibility. To address this important yet challenging task within the framework of performance-leading deep learning methods, regions of interest (RoIs) localization from large whole volume 3D images serves as a preceding operation that brings about multiple benefits in terms of speed, target completeness and reduction of false positives. Distinct from sliding window or discrete localization-segmentation based models, we propose a novel multi-task framework referred to as 3D RoI-aware U-Net (3D RU-Net), for RoI localization and intra-RoI segmentation where the two tasks share one backbone encoder network. With the region proposals from the encoder, we crop multi-level feature maps from the backbone network to form a GPU memory-efficient decoder for detail-preserving intra-RoI segmentation. To effectively train the model, we designed a Dice formulated loss function for the global-to-local multi-task learning procedure. Based on the promising efficiency gains demonstrated by the proposed method, we went on to ensemble multiple models to achieve even higher performance costing minor extra computational expensiveness. Extensive experiments were subsequently conducted on 64 cancerous cases with a four-fold cross-validation, and the results showed significant superiority in terms of accuracy and efficiency over conventional state-of-the art frameworks. In conclusion, the proposed method has a huge potential for extension to other 3D object segmentation tasks from medical images due to its inherent generalizability. The code for the proposed method is publicly available. 
### 532.A Multi-Task Learning Approach for Meal Assessment [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10343.pdf)
> Key role in the prevention of diet-related chronic diseases plays the balanced nutrition together with a proper diet. The conventional dietary assessment methods are time-consuming, expensive and prone to errors. New technology-based methods that provide reliable and convenient dietary assessment, have emerged during the last decade. The advances in the field of computer vision permitted the use of meal image to assess the nutrient content usually through three steps: food segmentation, recognition and volume estimation. In this paper, we propose a use one RGB meal image as input to a multi-task learning based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed approach achieved outstanding performance, while a comparison with state-of-the-art methods indicated that the proposed approach exhibits clear advantage in accuracy, along with a massive reduction of processing time. 
### 533.Disparity Image Segmentation For ADAS [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10350.pdf)
> We present a simple solution for segmenting grayscale images using existing Connected Component Labeling (CCL) algorithms (which are generally applied to binary images), which was efficient enough to be implemented in a constrained (embedded automotive) architecture. Our solution customizes the region growing and merging approach, and is primarily targeted for stereoscopic disparity images where nearer objects carry more relevance. We provide results from a standard OpenCV implementation for some basic cases and an image from the Tsukuba stereo-pair dataset. 
### 534.Learn-to-Score: Efficient 3D Scene Exploration by Predicting View  Utility [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10354.pdf)
> Camera equipped drones are nowadays being used to explore large scenes and reconstruct detailed 3D maps. When free space in the scene is approximately known, an offline planner can generate optimal plans to efficiently explore the scene. However, for exploring unknown scenes, the planner must predict and maximize usefulness of where to go on the fly. Traditionally, this has been achieved using handcrafted utility functions. We propose to learn a better utility function that predicts the usefulness of future viewpoints. Our learned utility function is based on a 3D convolutional neural network. This network takes as input a novel volumetric scene representation that implicitly captures previously visited viewpoints and generalizes to new scenes. We evaluate our method on several large 3D models of urban scenes using simulated depth cameras. We show that our method outperforms existing utility measures in terms of reconstruction performance and is robust to sensor noise. 
### 535.Context Proposals for Saliency Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10359.pdf)
> One of the fundamental properties of a salient object region is its contrast with the immediate context. The problem is that numerous object regions exist which potentially can all be salient. One way to prevent an exhaustive search over all object regions is by using object proposal algorithms. These return a limited set of regions which are most likely to contain an object. Several saliency estimation methods have used object proposals. However, they focus on the saliency of the proposal only, and the importance of its immediate context has not been evaluated. <br />In this paper, we aim to improve salient object detection. Therefore, we extend object proposal methods with context proposals, which allow to incorporate the immediate context in the saliency computation. We propose several saliency features which are computed from the context proposals. In the experiments, we evaluate five object proposal methods for the task of saliency segmentation, and find that Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping outperforms the others. Furthermore, experiments show that the proposed context features improve performance, and that our method matches results on the FT datasets and obtains competitive results on three other datasets (PASCAL-S, MSRA-B and ECSSD). 
### 536.Divergence-Free Shape Interpolation and Correspondence [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10417.pdf)
> We present a novel method to model and calculate deformation fields between shapes embedded in $\mathbb{R}^D$. Our framework combines naturally interpolating the two input shapes and calculating correspondences at the same time. The key idea is to compute a divergence-free deformation field represented in a coarse-to-fine basis using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion. The advantages are that there is no need to discretize the embedding space and the deformation is volume-preserving. Furthermore, the optimization is done on downsampled versions of the shapes but the morphing can be applied to any resolution without a heavy increase in complexity. We show results for shape correspondence, registration, inter- and extrapolation on the TOSCA and FAUST data sets. 
### 537.MTBI Identification From Diffusion MR Images Using Bag of Adversarial  Visual Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10419.pdf)
> In this work, we propose bag of adversarial features (BAF) for identifying mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) patients from their diffusion magnetic resonance images (MRI) (obtained within one month of injury) by incorporating unsupervised feature learning techniques. MTBI is a growing public health problem with an estimated incidence of over 1.7 million people annually in US. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and symptoms, and accurate, concrete measures of injury are lacking. Unlike most of previous works, which use hand-crafted features extracted from different parts of brain for MTBI classification, we employ feature learning algorithms to learn more discriminative representation for this task. A major challenge in this field thus far is the relatively small number of subjects available for training. This makes it difficult to use an end-to-end convolutional neural network to directly classify a subject from MR images. To overcome this challenge, we first apply an adversarial auto-encoder (with convolutional structure) to learn patch-level features, from overlapping image patches extracted from different brain regions. We then aggregate these features through a bag-of-word approach. We perform an extensive experimental study on a dataset of 227 subjects (including 109 MTBI patients, and 118 age and sex matched healthy controls), and compare the bag-of-deep-features with several previous approaches. Our experimental results show that the BAF significantly outperforms earlier works relying on the mean values of MR metrics in selected brain regions. 
### 538.Deep Steganalysis: End-to-End Learning with Supervisory Information  beyond Class Labels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10443.pdf)
> Recently, deep learning has shown its power in steganalysis. However, the proposed deep models have been often learned from pre-calculated noise residuals with fixed high-pass filters rather than from raw images. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end learning framework that can learn steganalytic features directly from pixels. In the meantime, the high-pass filters are also automatically learned. Besides class labels, we make use of additional pixel level supervision of cover-stego image pair to jointly and iteratively train the proposed network which consists of a residual calculation network and a steganalysis network. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. 
### 539.LPRNet: License Plate Recognition via Deep Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10447.pdf)
> This paper proposes LPRNet - end-to-end method for Automatic License Plate Recognition without preliminary character segmentation. Our approach is inspired by recent breakthroughs in Deep Neural Networks, and works in real-time with recognition accuracy up to 95% for Chinese license plates: 3 ms/plate on nVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 and 1.3 ms/plate on Intel Core i7-6700K CPU. LPRNet consists of the lightweight Convolutional Neural Network, so it can be trained in end-to-end way. To the best of our knowledge, LPRNet is the first real-time License Plate Recognition system that does not use RNNs. As a result, the LPRNet algorithm may be used to create embedded solutions for LPR that feature high level accuracy even on challenging Chinese license plates. 
### 540.Homogeneity of a region in the logarithmic image processing framework:  application to region growing algorithms [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10472.pdf)
> The current paper deals with the role played by Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) operators for evaluating the homogeneity of a region. Two new criteria of heterogeneity are introduced, one based on the LIP addition and the other based on the LIP scalar multiplication. Such tools are able to manage Region Growing algorithms following the Revol's technique: starting from an initial seed, they consist of applying specific dilations to the growing region while its inhomogeneity level does not exceed a certain level. The new approaches we introduce are significantly improving Revol's existing technique by making it robust to contrast variations in images. Such a property strongly reduces the chaining effect arising in region growing processes. 
### 541.Customizing an Adversarial Example Generator with Class-Conditional GANs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10496.pdf)
> Adversarial examples are intentionally crafted data with the purpose of deceiving neural networks into misclassification. When we talk about strategies to create such examples, we usually refer to perturbation-based methods that fabricate adversarial examples by applying invisible perturbations onto normal data. The resulting data reserve their visual appearance to human observers, yet can be totally unrecognizable to DNN models, which in turn leads to completely misleading predictions. In this paper, however, we consider crafting adversarial examples from existing data as a limitation to example diversity. We propose a non-perturbation-based framework that generates native adversarial examples from class-conditional generative adversarial networks.As such, the generated data will not resemble any existing data and thus expand example diversity, raising the difficulty in adversarial defense. We then extend this framework to pre-trained conditional GANs, in which we turn an existing generator into an "adversarial-example generator". We conduct experiments on our approach for MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets and have satisfactory results, showing that this approach can be a potential alternative to previous attack strategies. 
### 542.Every Pixel Counts: Unsupervised Geometry Learning with Holistic 3D  Motion Understanding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10556.pdf)
> Learning to estimate 3D geometry in a single image by watching unlabeled videos via deep convolutional network has made significant process recently. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, are based on the learning framework of rigid structure-from-motion, where only 3D camera ego motion is modeled for geometry estimation.However, moving objects also exist in many videos, e.g. moving cars in a street scene. In this paper, we tackle such motion by additionally incorporating per-pixel 3D object motion into the learning framework, which provides holistic 3D scene flow understanding and helps single image geometry estimation. Specifically, given two consecutive frames from a video, we adopt a motion network to predict their relative 3D camera pose and a segmentation mask distinguishing moving objects and rigid background. An optical flow network is used to estimate dense 2D per-pixel correspondence. A single image depth network predicts depth maps for both images. The four types of information, i.e. 2D flow, camera pose, segment mask and depth maps, are integrated into a differentiable holistic 3D motion parser (HMP), where per-pixel 3D motion for rigid background and moving objects are recovered. We design various losses w.r.t. the two types of 3D motions for training the depth and motion networks, yielding further error reduction for estimated geometry. Finally, in order to solve the 3D motion confusion from monocular videos, we combine stereo images into joint training. Experiments on KITTI 2015 dataset show that our estimated geometry, 3D motion and moving object masks, not only are constrained to be consistent, but also significantly outperforms other SOTA algorithms, demonstrating the benefits of our approach. 
### 543.Multimodal Image Denoising based on Coupled Dictionary Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10678.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a new multimodal image denoising approach to attenuate white Gaussian additive noise in a given image modality under the aid of a guidance image modality. The proposed coupled image denoising approach consists of two stages: coupled sparse coding and reconstruction. The first stage performs joint sparse transform for multimodal images with respect to a group of learned coupled dictionaries, followed by a shrinkage operation on the sparse representations. Then, in the second stage, the shrunken representations, together with coupled dictionaries, contribute to the reconstruction of the denoised image via an inverse transform. The proposed denoising scheme demonstrates the capability to capture both the common and distinct features of different data modalities. This capability makes our approach more robust to inconsistencies between the guidance and the target images, thereby overcoming drawbacks such as the texture copying artifacts. Experiments on real multimodal images demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to better employ guidance information to bring notable benefits in the image denoising task with respect to the state-of-the-art. 
### 544.Dynamic texture analysis with diffusion in networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10681.pdf)
> Dynamic texture is a field of research that has gained considerable interest from computer vision community due to the explosive growth of multimedia databases. In addition, dynamic texture is present in a wide range of videos, which makes it very important in expert systems based on videos such as medical systems, traffic monitoring systems, forest fire detection system, among others. In this paper, a new method for dynamic texture characterization based on diffusion in directed networks is proposed. The dynamic texture is modeled as a directed network. The method consists in the analysis of the dynamic of this network after a series of graph cut transformations based on the edge weights. For each network transformation, the activity for each vertex is estimated. The activity is the relative frequency that one vertex is visited by random walks in balance. Then, texture descriptor is constructed by concatenating the activity histograms. The main contributions of this paper are the use of directed network modeling and diffusion in network to dynamic texture characterization. These tend to provide better performance in dynamic textures classification. Experiments with rotation and interference of the motion pattern were conducted in order to demonstrate the robustness of the method. The proposed approach is compared to other dynamic texture methods on two very well know dynamic texture database and on traffic condition classification, and outperform in most of the cases. 
### 545.A Hybrid Framework for Tumor Saliency Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10696.pdf)
> Automatic tumor segmentation of breast ultrasound (BUS) image is quite challenging due to the complicated anatomic structure of breast and poor image quality. Most tumor segmentation approaches achieve good performance on BUS images collected in controlled settings; however, the performance degrades greatly with BUS images from different sources. Tumor saliency estimation (TSE) has attracted increasing attention to solving the problem by modeling radiologists' attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid framework for TSE, which integrates both high-level domain-knowledge and robust low-level saliency assumptions and can overcome drawbacks caused by direct mapping in traditional TSE approaches. The new framework integrated the Neutro-Connectedness (NC) map, the adaptive-center, the correlation and the layer structure-based weighted map. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art TSE methods. 
### 546.Gradient Similarity: An Explainable Approach to Detect Adversarial  Attacks against Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10707.pdf)
> Deep neural networks are susceptible to small-but-specific adversarial perturbations capable of deceiving the network. This vulnerability can lead to potentially harmful consequences in security-critical applications. To address this vulnerability, we propose a novel metric called \emph{Gradient Similarity} that allows us to capture the influence of training data on test inputs. We show that \emph{Gradient Similarity} behaves differently for normal and adversarial inputs, and enables us to detect a variety of adversarial attacks with a near perfect ROC-AUC of 95-100\%. Even white-box adversaries equipped with perfect knowledge of the system cannot bypass our detector easily. On the MNIST dataset, white-box attacks are either detected with a high ROC-AUC of 87-96\%, or require very high distortion to bypass our detector. 
### 547.Deep CNN Denoiser and Multi-layer Neighbor Component Embedding for Face  Hallucination [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10726.pdf)
> Most of the current face hallucination methods, whether they are shallow learning-based or deep learning-based, all try to learn a relationship model between Low-Resolution (LR) and High-Resolution (HR) spaces with the help of a training set. They mainly focus on modeling image prior through either model-based optimization or discriminative inference learning. However, when the input LR face is tiny, the learned prior knowledge is no longer effective and their performance will drop sharply. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a general face hallucination method that can integrate model-based optimization and discriminative inference. In particular, to exploit the model based prior, the Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) denoiser prior is plugged into the super-resolution optimization model with the aid of image-adaptive Laplacian regularization. Additionally, we further develop a high-frequency details compensation method by dividing the face image to facial components and performing face hallucination in a multi-layer neighbor embedding manner. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve promising super-resolution results for tiny input LR faces. 
### 548.Two-layer Lossless HDR Coding considering Histogram Sparseness with  Backward Compatibility to JPEG [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10746.pdf)
> An efficient two-layer coding method using the histogram packing technique with the backward compatibility to the legacy JPEG is proposed in this paper. The JPEG XT, which is the international standard to compress HDR images, adopts two-layer coding scheme for backward compatibility to the legacy JPEG. However, this two-layer coding structure does not give better lossless performance than the other existing single-layer coding methods for HDR images. Moreover, the JPEG XT has problems on determination of the lossless coding parameters; Finding appropriate combination of the parameter values is necessary to achieve good lossless performance. The histogram sparseness of HDR images is discussed and it is pointed out that the histogram packing technique considering the sparseness is able to improve the performance of lossless compression for HDR images and a novel two-layer coding with the histogram packing technique is proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that not only the proposed method has a better lossless compression performance than that of the JPEG XT, but also there is no need to determine image-dependent parameter values for good compression performance in spite of having the backward compatibility to the well known legacy JPEG standard. 
### 549.Towards automatic initialization of registration algorithms using  simulated endoscopy images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10748.pdf)
> Registering images from different modalities is an active area of research in computer aided medical interventions. Several registration algorithms have been developed, many of which achieve high accuracy. However, these results are dependent on many factors, including the quality of the extracted features or segmentations being registered as well as the initial alignment. Although several methods have been developed towards improving segmentation algorithms and automating the segmentation process, few automatic initialization algorithms have been explored. In many cases, the initial alignment from which a registration is initiated is performed manually, which interferes with the clinical workflow. Our aim is to use scene classification in endoscopic procedures to achieve coarse alignment of the endoscope and a preoperative image of the anatomy. In this paper, we show using simulated scenes that a neural network can predict the region of anatomy (with respect to a preoperative image) that the endoscope is located in by observing a single endoscopic video frame. With limited training and without any hyperparameter tuning, our method achieves an accuracy of 76.53 (+/-1.19)%. There are several avenues for improvement, making this a promising direction of research. Code is available at <a href="https://github.com/AyushiSinha/AutoInitialization.">this https URL</a> 
### 550.State-aware Anti-drift Robust Correlation Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10759.pdf)
> Correlation filter (CF) based trackers have aroused increasing attentions in visual tracking field due to the superior performance on several datasets while maintaining high running speed. For each frame, an ideal filter is trained in order to discriminate the target from its surrounding background. Considering that the target always undergoes external and internal interference during tracking procedure, the trained filter should take consideration of not only the external distractions but also the target appearance variation synchronously. To this end, we present a State-aware Anti-drift Tracker (SAT) in this paper, which jointly model the discrimination and reliability information in filter learning. Specifically, global context patches are incorporated into filter training stage to better distinguish the target from backgrounds. Meanwhile, a color-based reliable mask is learned to encourage the filter to focus on more reliable regions suitable for tracking. We show that the proposed optimization problem could be efficiently solved using Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers and fully carried out in Fourier domain. Extensive experiments are conducted on OTB-100 datasets to compare the SAT tracker (both hand-crafted feature and CNN feature) with other relevant state-of-the-art methods. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed work. 
### 551.Differentiable Learning-to-Normalize via Switchable Normalization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10779.pdf)
> We address a learning-to-normalize problem by proposing Switchable Normalization (SN), which learns to select different operations for different normalization layers of a deep neural network (DNN). SN switches among three distinct scopes to compute statistics (means and variances) including a channel, a layer, and a minibatch, by learning their importance weights in an end-to-end manner. SN has several good properties. First, it adapts to various network architectures and tasks (see Fig.1). Second, it is robust to a wide range of batch sizes, maintaining high performance when small minibatch is presented (e.g. 2 images/GPU). Third, SN treats all channels as a group, unlike group normalization that searches the number of groups as a hyper-parameter. Without bells and whistles, SN outperforms its counterparts on various challenging problems, such as image classification in ImageNet, object detection and segmentation in COCO, artistic image stylization, and neural architecture search. We hope SN will help ease the usages and understand the effects of normalization techniques in deep learning. The code of SN will be made available in <a href="https://github.com/switchablenorms/.">this https URL</a> 
### 552.Accurate and efficient video de-fencing using convolutional neural  networks and temporal information [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10781.pdf)
> De-fencing is to eliminate the captured fence on an image or a video, providing a clear view of the scene. It has been applied for many purposes including assisting photographers and improving the performance of computer vision algorithms such as object detection and recognition. However, the state-of-the-art de-fencing methods have limited performance caused by the difficulty of fence segmentation and also suffer from the motion of the camera or objects. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel method consisting of segmentation using convolutional neural networks and a fast/robust recovery algorithm. The segmentation algorithm using convolutional neural network achieves significant improvement in the accuracy of fence segmentation. The recovery algorithm using optical flow produces plausible de-fenced images and videos. The proposed method is experimented on both our diverse and complex dataset and publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance for both segmentation and content recovery. 
### 553.How To Extract Fashion Trends From Social Media? A Robust Object  Detector With Support For Unsupervised Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10787.pdf)
> With the proliferation of social media, fashion inspired from celebrities, reputed designers as well as fashion influencers has shortened the cycle of fashion design and manufacturing. However, with the explosion of fashion related content and large number of user generated fashion photos, it is an arduous task for fashion designers to wade through social media photos and create a digest of trending fashion. This necessitates deep parsing of fashion photos on social media to localize and classify multiple fashion items from a given fashion photo. While object detection competitions such as MSCOCO have thousands of samples for each of the object categories, it is quite difficult to get large labeled datasets for fast fashion items. Moreover, state-of-the-art object detectors do not have any functionality to ingest large amount of unlabeled data available on social media in order to fine tune object detectors with labeled datasets. In this work, we show application of a generic object detector, that can be pretrained in an unsupervised manner, on 24 categories from recently released Open Images V4 dataset. We first train the base architecture of the object detector using unsupervisd learning on 60K unlabeled photos from 24 categories gathered from social media, and then subsequently fine tune it on 8.2K labeled photos from Open Images V4 dataset. On 300 X 300 image inputs, we achieve 72.7% mAP on a test dataset of 2.4K photos while performing 11% to 17% better as compared to the state-of-the-art object detectors. We show that this improvement is due to our choice of architecture that lets us do unsupervised learning and that performs significantly better in identifying small objects. 
### 554.Beyond One-hot Encoding: lower dimensional target embedding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10805.pdf)
> Target encoding plays a central role when learning Convolutional Neural Networks. In this realm, One-hot encoding is the most prevalent strategy due to its simplicity. However, this so widespread encoding schema assumes a flat label space, thus ignoring rich relationships existing among labels that can be exploited during training. In large-scale datasets, data does not span the full label space, but instead lies in a low-dimensional output manifold. Following this observation, we embed the targets into a low-dimensional space, drastically improving convergence speed while preserving accuracy. Our contribution is two fold: (i) We show that random projections of the label space are a valid tool to find such lower dimensional embeddings, boosting dramatically convergence rates at zero computational cost; and (ii) we propose a normalized eigenrepresentation of the class manifold that encodes the targets with minimal information loss, improving the accuracy of random projections encoding while enjoying the same convergence rates. Experiments on CIFAR-100, CUB200-2011, Imagenet, and MIT Places demonstrate that the proposed approach drastically improves convergence speed while reaching very competitive accuracy rates. 
### 555.Automatic Rank Selection for High-Speed Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10821.pdf)
> Low-rank decomposition plays a central role in accelerating convolutional neural network (CNN), and the rank of decomposed kernel-tensor is a key parameter that determines the complexity and accuracy of a neural network. In this paper, we define rank selection as a combinatorial optimization problem and propose a methodology to minimize network complexity while maintaining the desired accuracy. Combinatorial optimization is not feasible due to search space limitations. To restrict the search space and obtain the optimal rank, we define the space constraint parameters with a boundary condition. We also propose a linearly-approximated accuracy function to predict the fine-tuned accuracy of the optimized CNN model during the cost reduction. Experimental results on AlexNet and VGG-16 show that the proposed rank selection algorithm satisfies the accuracy constraint. Our method combined with truncated-SVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of inference and training time at almost the same accuracy. 
### 556.Grassmannian Discriminant Maps (GDM) for Manifold Dimensionality  Reduction with Application to Image Set Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10830.pdf)
> In image set classification, a considerable progress has been made by representing original image sets on Grassmann manifolds. In order to extend the advantages of the Euclidean based dimensionality reduction methods to the Grassmann Manifold, several methods have been suggested recently which jointly perform dimensionality reduction and metric learning on Grassmann manifold to improve performance. Nevertheless, when applied to complex datasets, the learned features do not exhibit enough discriminatory power. To overcome this problem, we propose a new method named Grassmannian Discriminant Maps (GDM) for manifold dimensionality reduction problems. The core of the method is a new discriminant function for metric learning and dimensionality reduction. For comparison and better understanding, we also study a simple variations to GDM. The key difference between them is the discriminant function. We experiment on data sets corresponding to three tasks: face recognition, object categorization, and hand gesture recognition to evaluate the proposed method and its simple extensions. Compared with the state of the art, the results achieved show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. 
### 557.CT Image Registration in Acute Stroke Monitoring [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10836.pdf)
> We present a new system based on tracking the temporal evolution of stroke lesions using an image registration technique on CT exams of the patient's brain. The system is able to compare past CT exams with the most recent one related to stroke event in order to evaluate past lesions which are not related to stroke. Then, it can compare recent CT exams related to the current stroke for assessing the evolution of the lesion over time. A new similarity measure is also introduced for the comparison of the source and target images during image registration. It will result in a cheaper, faster and more accessible evaluation of the acute phase of the stroke overcoming the current limitations of the proposed systems in the state-of-the-art. 
### 558.DeepSDCS: Dissecting cancer proliferation heterogeneity in Ki67 digital  whole slide images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10850.pdf)
> Ki67 is an important biomarker for breast cancer. Classification of positive and negative Ki67 cells in histology slides is a common approach to determine cancer proliferation status. However, there is a lack of generalizable and accurate methods to automate Ki67 scoring in large-scale patient cohorts. In this work, we have employed a novel deep learning technique based on hypercolumn descriptors for cell classification in Ki67 images. Specifically, we developed the Simultaneous Detection and Cell Segmentation (DeepSDCS) network to perform cell segmentation and detection. VGG16 network was used for the training and fine tuning to training data. We extracted the hypercolumn descriptors of each cell to form the vector of activation from specific layers to capture features at different granularity. Features from these layers that correspond to the same pixel were propagated using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer to yield the detection of the nuclei and the final cell segmentations. Subsequently, seeds generated from cell segmentation were propagated to a spatially constrained convolutional neural network for the classification of the cells into stromal, lymphocyte, Ki67-positive cancer cell, and Ki67-negative cancer cell. We validated its accuracy in the context of a large-scale clinical trial of oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. We achieved 99.06% and 89.59% accuracy on two separate test sets of Ki67 stained breast cancer dataset comprising biopsy and whole-slide images. 
### 559.Expolring Architectures for CNN-Based Word Spotting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10866.pdf)
> The goal in word spotting is to retrieve parts of document images which are relevant with respect to a certain user-defined query. The recent past has seen attribute-based Convolutional Neural Networks take over this field of research. As is common for other fields of computer vision, the CNNs used for this task are already considerably deep. The question that arises, however, is: How complex does a CNN have to be for word spotting? Are increasingly deeper models giving increasingly bet- ter results or does performance behave asymptotically for these architectures? On the other hand, can similar results be obtained with a much smaller CNN? The goal of this paper is to give an answer to these questions. Therefore, the recently successful TPP- PHOCNet will be compared to a Residual Network, a Densely Connected Convolutional Network and a LeNet architecture empirically. As will be seen in the evaluation, a complex model can be beneficial for word spotting on harder tasks such as the IAM Offline Database but gives no advantage for easier benchmarks such as the George Washington Database. 
### 560.Efficient CNN Implementation for Eye-Gaze Estimation on  Low-Power/Low-Quality Consumer Imaging Systems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10890.pdf)
> Accurate and efficient eye gaze estimation is important for emerging consumer electronic systems such as driver monitoring systems and novel user interfaces. Such systems are required to operate reliably in difficult, unconstrained environments with low power consumption and at minimal cost. In this paper a new hardware friendly, convolutional neural network model with minimal computational requirements is introduced and assessed for efficient appearance-based gaze estimation. The model is tested and compared against existing appearance based CNN approaches, achieving better eye gaze accuracy with significantly fewer computational requirements. A brief updated literature review is also provided. 
### 561.Deep learning for dehazing: Comparison and analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10923.pdf)
> We compare a recent dehazing method based on deep learning, Dehazenet, with traditional state-of-the-art approaches , on benchmark data with reference. Dehazenet estimates the depth map from transmission factor on a single color image, which is used to inverse the Koschmieder model of imaging in the presence of haze. In this sense, the solution is still attached to the Koschmieder model. We demonstrate that the transmission is very well estimated by the network, but also that this method exhibits the same limitation than others due to the use of the same imaging model. 
### 562.High Diversity Attribute Guided Face Generation with GANs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10982.pdf)
> In this work we focused on GAN-based solution for the attribute guided face synthesis. Previous works exploited GANs for generation of photo-realistic face images and did not pay attention to the question of diversity of the resulting images. The proposed solution in its turn introducing novel latent space of unit complex numbers is able to provide the diversity on the "birthday paradox" score 3 times higher than the size of the training dataset. It is important to emphasize that our result is shown on relatively small dataset (20k samples vs 200k) while preserving photo-realistic properties of generated faces on significantly higher resolution (128x128 in comparison to 32x32 of previous works). 
### 563.Modeling Spatio-Temporal Human Track Structure for Action Localization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11008.pdf)
> This paper addresses spatio-temporal localization of human actions in video. In order to localize actions in time, we propose a recurrent localization network (RecLNet) designed to model the temporal structure of actions on the level of person tracks. Our model is trained to simultaneously recognize and localize action classes in time and is based on two layer gated recurrent units (GRU) applied separately to two streams, i.e. appearance and optical flow streams. When used together with state-of-the-art person detection and tracking, our model is shown to improve substantially spatio-temporal action localization in videos. The gain is shown to be mainly due to improved temporal localization. We evaluate our method on two recent datasets for spatio-temporal action localization, UCF101-24 and DALY, demonstrating a significant improvement of the state of the art. 
### 564.Robust pose tracking with a joint model of appearance and shape [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11011.pdf)
> We present a novel approach for estimating the 2D pose of an articulated object with an application to automated video analysis of small laboratory animals. We have found that deformable part models developed for humans, exemplified by the flexible mixture of parts (FMP) model, typically fail on challenging animal poses. We argue that beyond encoding appearance and spatial relations, shape is needed to overcome the lack of distinctive landmarks on laboratory animal bodies. In our approach, a shape consistent FMP (scFMP) model computes promising pose candidates after a standard FMP model is used to rapidly discard false part detections. This "cascaded" approach combines the relative strengths of spatial-relations, appearance and shape representations and is shown to yield significant improvements over the original FMP model as well as a representative deep neural network baseline. 
### 565.Deep Semi Supervised Generative Learning for Automated PD-L1 Tumor Cell  Scoring on NSCLC Tissue Needle Biopsies [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11036.pdf)
> The level of PD-L1 expression in immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays is a key biomarker for the identification of Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer (NSCLC) patients that may respond to anti PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. The quantification of PD-L1 expression currently includes the visual estimation of a Tumor Cell (TC) score by a pathologist and consists of evaluating the ratio of PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative tumor cells. Known challenges like differences in positivity estimation around clinically relevant cut-offs and sub-optimal quality of samples makes visual scoring tedious and subjective, yielding a scoring variability between pathologists. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning solution that enables the first automated and objective scoring of PD-L1 expression in late stage NSCLC needle biopsies. To account for the low amount of tissue available in biopsy images and to restrict the amount of manual annotations necessary for training, we explore the use of semi-supervised approaches against standard fully supervised methods. We consolidate the manual annotations used for training as well the visual TC scores used for quantitative evaluation with multiple pathologists. Concordance measures computed on a set of slides unseen during training provide evidence that our automatic scoring method matches visual scoring on the considered dataset while ensuring repeatability and objectivity. 
### 566.A probabilistic constrained clustering for transfer learning and image  category discovery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11078.pdf)
> Neural network-based clustering has recently gained popularity, and in particular a constrained clustering formulation has been proposed to perform transfer learning and image category discovery using deep learning. The core idea is to formulate a clustering objective with pairwise constraints that can be used to train a deep clustering network; therefore the cluster assignments and their underlying feature representations are jointly optimized end-to-end. In this work, we provide a novel clustering formulation to address scalability issues of previous work in terms of optimizing deeper networks and larger amounts of categories. The proposed objective directly minimizes the negative log-likelihood of cluster assignment with respect to the pairwise constraints, has no hyper-parameters, and demonstrates improved scalability and performance on both supervised learning and unsupervised transfer learning. 
### 567.Deep Learning Based Instance Segmentation in 3D Biomedical Images Using  Weak Annotation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11137.pdf)
> Instance segmentation in 3D images is a fundamental task in biomedical image analysis. While deep learning models often work well for 2D instance segmentation, 3D instance segmentation still faces critical challenges, such as insufficient training data due to various annotation difficulties in 3D biomedical images. Common 3D annotation methods (e.g., full voxel annotation) incur high workloads and costs for labeling enough instances for training deep learning 3D instance segmentation models. In this paper, we propose a new weak annotation approach for training a fast deep learning 3D instance segmentation model without using full voxel mask annotation. Our approach needs only 3D bounding boxes for all instances and full voxel annotation for a small fraction of the instances, and uses a novel two-stage 3D instance segmentation model utilizing these two kinds of annotation, respectively. We evaluate our approach on several biomedical image datasets, and the experimental results show that (1) with full annotated boxes and a small amount of masks, our approach can achieve similar performance as the best known methods using full annotation, and (2) with similar annotation time, our approach outperforms the best known methods that use full annotation. 
### 568.3D Normal Coordinate Systems for Cortical Areas [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11169.pdf)
> A surface-based diffeomorphic algorithm to generate 3D coordinate grids in the cortical ribbon is described. In the grid, normal coordinate lines are generated by the diffeomorphic evolution from the grey/white (inner) surface to the grey/csf (outer) surface. Specifically, the cortical ribbon is described by two triangulated surfaces with open boundaries. Conceptually, the inner surface sits on top of the white matter structure and the outer on top of the gray matter. It is assumed that the cortical ribbon consists of cortical columns which are orthogonal to the white matter surface. This might be viewed as a consequence of the development of the columns in the embryo. It is also assumed that the columns are orthogonal to the outer surface so that the resultant vector field is orthogonal to the evolving surface. Then the distance of the normal lines from the vector field such that the inner surface evolves diffeomorphically towards the outer one can be construed as a measure of thickness. Applications are described for the auditory cortices in human adults and cats with normal hearing or hearing loss. The approach offers great potential for cortical morphometry. 
### 569.A New Angle on L2 Regularization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11186.pdf)
> Imagine two high-dimensional clusters and a hyperplane separating them. Consider in particular the angle between: the direction joining the two clusters' centroids and the normal to the hyperplane. In linear classification, this angle depends on the level of L2 regularization used. Can you explain why? 
### 570.CR-GAN: Learning Complete Representations for Multi-view Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11191.pdf)
> Generating multi-view images from a single-view input is an essential yet challenging problem. It has broad applications in vision, graphics, and robotics. Our study indicates that the widely-used generative adversarial network (GAN) may learn "incomplete" representations due to the single-pathway framework: an encoder-decoder network followed by a discriminator network. We propose CR-GAN to address this problem. In addition to the single reconstruction path, we introduce a generation sideway to maintain the completeness of the learned embedding space. The two learning pathways collaborate and compete in a parameter-sharing manner, yielding considerably improved generalization ability to "unseen" dataset. More importantly, the two-pathway framework makes it possible to combine both labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which further enriches the embedding space for realistic generations. The experimental results prove that CR-GAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially when generating from "unseen" inputs in wild conditions. 
### 571.Adversarial and Perceptual Refinement for Compressed Sensing MRI  Reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11216.pdf)
> Deep learning approaches have shown promising performance for compressed sensing-based Magnetic Resonance Imaging. While deep neural networks trained with mean squared error (MSE) loss functions can achieve high peak signal to noise ratio, the reconstructed images are often blurry and lack sharp details, especially for higher undersampling rates. Recently, adversarial and perceptual loss functions have been shown to achieve more visually appealing results. However, it remains an open question how to (1) optimally combine these loss functions with the MSE loss function and (2) evaluate such a perceptual enhancement. In this work, we propose a hybrid method, in which a visual refinement component is learnt on top of an MSE loss-based reconstruction network. In addition, we introduce a semantic interpretability score, measuring the visibility of the region of interest in both ground truth and reconstructed images, which allows us to objectively quantify the usefulness of the image quality for image post-processing and analysis. Applied on a large cardiac MRI dataset simulated with 8-fold undersampling, we demonstrate significant improvements ($p&lt;0.01$) over the state-of-the-art in both a human observer study and the semantic interpretability score. 
### 572.Subject2Vec: Generative-Discriminative Approach from a Set of Image  Patches to a Vector [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11217.pdf)
> We propose an attention-based method that aggregates local image features to a subject-level representation for predicting disease severity. In contrast to classical deep learning that requires a fixed dimensional input, our method operates on a set of image patches; hence it can accommodate variable length input image without image resizing. The model learns a clinically interpretable subject-level representation that is reflective of the disease severity. Our model consists of three mutually dependent modules which regulate each other: (1) a discriminative network that learns a fixed-length representation from local features and maps them to disease severity; (2) an attention mechanism that provides interpretability by focusing on the areas of the anatomy that contribute the most to the prediction task; and (3) a generative network that encourages the diversity of the local latent features. The generative term ensures that the attention weights are non-degenerate while maintaining the relevance of the local regions to the disease severity. We train our model end-to-end in the context of a large-scale lung CT study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Our model gives state-of-the art performance in predicting clinical measures of severity for COPD. The distribution of the attention provides the regional relevance of lung tissue to the clinical measurements. 
### 573.Active query-driven visual search using probabilistic bisection and  convolutional neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11223.pdf)
> We present a novel efficient object detection and localization framework based on the probabilistic bisection algorithm. A convolutional neural network is trained and used as a noisy oracle that provides answers to input query images. The responses along with error probability estimates obtained from the CNN are used to update beliefs on the object location along each dimension. We show that querying along each dimension achieves the same lower bound on localization error as the joint query design. Finally, we provide experimental results on a face localization task that showcase the effectiveness of our approach in comparison to sliding window techniques. 
### 574.Human Action Recognition and Prediction: A Survey [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11230.pdf)
> Derived from rapid advances in computer vision and machine learning, video analysis tasks have been moving from inferring the present state to predicting the future state. Vision-based action recognition and prediction from videos are such tasks, where action recognition is to infer human actions (present state) based upon complete action executions, and action prediction to predict human actions (future state) based upon incomplete action executions. These two tasks have become particularly prevalent topics recently because of their explosively emerging real-world applications, such as visual surveillance, autonomous driving vehicle, entertainment, and video retrieval, etc. Many attempts have been devoted in the last a few decades in order to build a robust and effective framework for action recognition and prediction. In this paper, we survey the complete state-of-the-art techniques in the action recognition and prediction. Existing models, popular algorithms, technical difficulties, popular action databases, evaluation protocols, and promising future directions are also provided with systematic discussions. 
### 575.Gated Feedback Refinement Network for Coarse-to-Fine Dense Semantic  Image Labeling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11266.pdf)
> Effective integration of local and global contextual information is crucial for semantic segmentation and dense image labeling. We develop two encoder-decoder based deep learning architectures to address this problem. We first propose a network architecture called Label Refinement Network (LRN) that predicts segmentation labels in a coarse-to-fine fashion at several spatial resolutions. In this network, we also define loss functions at several stages to provide supervision at different stages of training. However, there are limits to the quality of refinement possible if ambiguous information is passed forward. In order to address this issue, we also propose Gated Feedback Refinement Network (G-FRNet) that addresses this limitation. Initially, G-FRNet makes a coarse-grained prediction which it progressively refines to recover details by effectively integrating local and global contextual information during the refinement stages. This is achieved by gate units proposed in this work, that control information passed forward in order to resolve the ambiguity. Experiments were conducted on four challenging dense labeling datasets (CamVid, PASCAL VOC 2012, Horse-Cow Parsing, PASCAL-Person-Part, and SUN-RGBD). G-FRNet achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation results on the CamVid and Horse-Cow Parsing datasets and produces results competitive with the best performing approaches that appear in the literature for the other three datasets. 
### 576.Action Recognition for Depth Video using Multi-view Dynamic Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11269.pdf)
> Dynamic image is the recently emerged action representation paradigm able to compactly capture the temporal evolution, especially in context of deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Inspired by its preliminary success towards RGB videos, we propose its extension to the depth domain. To better exploit the 3D characteristics of depth video to leverage the performance, multi-view dynamic image is proposed by us. In particular, the raw depth video will be densely projected onto the different imaging view-points by rotating the virtual camera around the specific instances within the 3D space. Dynamic images are then extracted from the yielded multi-view depth videos respectively to constitute the multi-view dynamic images. In this way, more view-tolerant representative information can be involved in multiview dynamic images than the single-view counterpart. A novel CNN learning model is consequently proposed to execute feature learning on multi-view dynamic images. The dynamic images from different views will share the same convolutional layers, but with the different fully-connected layers. This model aims to enhance the tuning of shallow convolutional layers by alleviating gradient vanishing. Furthermore, to address the effect of spatial variation an action proposal method based on faster R-CNN is proposed. The dynamic images will be extracted only from the action proposal regions. In experiments, our approach can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on 3 challenging datasets (i.e., NTU RGB-D, Northwestern-UCLA and UWA3DII). 
### 577.Excavate Condition-invariant Space by Intrinsic Encoder [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11306.pdf)
> As the human, we can recognize the places across a wide range of changing environmental conditions such as those caused by weathers, seasons, and day-night cycles. We can excavate and memorize the stable semantic structure of different places and scenes. For example, we can recognize tree whether the bare tree in winter or lush tree in summer. Therefore, the intrinsic features that are corresponding to specific semantic contents and condition-invariant of appearance changes can improve the performance of long-term place recognition significantly. <br />In this paper, we propose a novel intrinsic encoder that excavates the condition-invariant latent space of different places under drastic appearance changes. Our method excavates the space of intrinsic structure features by self-supervised cycle loss designed based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Different from previous learning based place recognition methods that need paired training data of each place with appearance changes, we employ the weakly-supervised strategy to utilize unpaired set-based training data of different environmental conditions. <br />We conduct comprehensive experiments on the standard datasets and show that our semi-supervised intrinsic encoder achieves excellent performance for place recognition under drastic appearance changes. 
### 578.Hyperspectral Image Dataset for Benchmarking on Salient Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11314.pdf)
> Many works have been done on salient object detection using supervised or unsupervised approaches on colour images. Recently, a few studies demonstrated that efficient salient object detection can also be implemented by using spectral features in visible spectrum of hyperspectral images from natural scenes. However, these models on hyperspectral salient object detection were tested with a very few number of data selected from various online public dataset, which are not specifically created for object detection purposes. Therefore, here, we aim to contribute to the field by releasing a hyperspectral salient object detection dataset with a collection of 60 hyperspectral images with their respective ground-truth binary images and representative rendered colour images (sRGB). We took several aspects in consideration during the data collection such as variation in object size, number of objects, foreground-background contrast, object position on the image, and etc. Then, we prepared ground truth binary images for each hyperspectral data, where salient objects are labelled on the images. Finally, we did performance evaluation using Area Under Curve (AUC) metric on some existing hyperspectral saliency detection models in literature. 
### 579.A flexible model for training action localization with varying levels of  supervision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11328.pdf)
> Spatio-temporal action detection in videos is typically addressed in a fully-supervised setup with manual annotation of training videos required at every frame. Since such annotation is extremely tedious and prohibits scalability, there is a clear need to minimize the amount of manual supervision. In this work we propose a unifying framework that can handle and combine varying types of less-demanding weak supervision. Our model is based on discriminative clustering and integrates different types of supervision as constraints on the optimization. We investigate applications of such a model to training setups with alternative supervisory signals ranging from video-level class labels over temporal points or sparse action bounding boxes to the full per-frame annotation of action bounding boxes. Experiments on the challenging UCF101-24 and DALY datasets demonstrate competitive performance of our method at a fraction of supervision used by previous methods. The flexibility of our model enables joint learning from data with different levels of annotation. Experimental results demonstrate a significant gain by adding a few fully supervised examples to otherwise weakly labeled videos. 
### 580.Ignition: An End-to-End Supervised Model for Training Simulated  Self-Driving Vehicles [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11349.pdf)
> We introduce Ignition: an end-to-end neural network architecture for training unconstrained self-driving vehicles in simulated environments. The model is a ResNet-18 variant, which is fed in images from the front of a simulated F1 car, and outputs optimal labels for steering, throttle, braking. Importantly, we never explicitly train the model to detect road features like the outline of a track or distance to other cars; instead, we illustrate that these latent features can be automatically encapsulated by the network. 
### 581.Detecting Mammals in UAV Images: Best Practices to address a  substantially Imbalanced Dataset with Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11368.pdf)
> Knowledge over the number of animals in large wildlife reserves is a vital necessity for park rangers in their efforts to protect endangered species. Manual animal censuses are dangerous and expensive, hence Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with consumer level digital cameras are becoming a popular alternative tool to estimate livestock. Several works have been proposed that semi-automatically process UAV images to detect animals, of which some employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a recent family of deep learning algorithms that proved very effective in object detection in large datasets from computer vision. However, the majority of works related to wildlife focuses only on small datasets (typically subsets of UAV campaigns), which might be detrimental when presented with the sheer scale of real study areas for large mammal census. Methods may yield thousands of false alarms in such cases. In this paper, we study how to scale CNNs to large wildlife census tasks and present a number of recommendations to train a CNN on a large UAV dataset. We further introduce novel evaluation protocols that are tailored to censuses and model suitability for subsequent human verification of detections. Using our recommendations, we are able to train a CNN reducing the number of false positives by an order of magnitude compared to previous state-of-the-art. Setting the requirements at 90% recall, our CNN allows to reduce the amount of data required for manual verification by three times, thus making it possible for rangers to screen all the data acquired efficiently and to detect almost all animals in the reserve automatically. 
### 582.Towards real-time unsupervised monocular depth estimation on CPU [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11430.pdf)
> Unsupervised depth estimation from a single image is a very attractive technique with several implications in robotic, autonomous navigation, augmented reality and so on. This topic represents a very challenging task and the advent of deep learning enabled to tackle this problem with excellent results. However, these architectures are extremely deep and complex. Thus, real-time performance can be achieved only by leveraging power-hungry GPUs that do not allow to infer depth maps in application fields characterized by low-power constraints. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a novel architecture capable to quickly infer an accurate depth map on a CPU, even of an embedded system, using a pyramid of features extracted from a single input image. Similarly to state-of-the-art, we train our network in an unsupervised manner casting depth estimation as an image reconstruction problem. Extensive experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that compared to the top performing approach our network has similar accuracy but a much lower complexity (about 6% of parameters) enabling to infer a depth map for a KITTI image in about 1.7 s on the Raspberry Pi 3 and at more than 8 Hz on a standard CPU. Moreover, by trading accuracy for efficiency, our network allows to infer maps at about 2 Hz and 40 Hz respectively, still being more accurate than most state-of-the-art slower methods. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method enabling such performance on CPUs paving the way for effective deployment of unsupervised monocular depth estimation even on embedded systems. 
### 583.MRFusion: A Deep Learning architecture to fuse PAN and MS imagery for  land cover mapping [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11452.pdf)
> Nowadays, Earth Observation systems provide a multitude of heterogeneous remote sensing data. How to manage such richness leveraging its complementarity is a crucial chal- lenge in modern remote sensing analysis. Data Fusion techniques deal with this point proposing method to combine and exploit complementarity among the different data sensors. Considering optical Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) images, satellites obtain both Multi Spectral (MS) and panchro- matic (PAN) images at different spatial resolution. VHSR images are extensively exploited to produce land cover maps to deal with agricultural, ecological, and socioeconomic issues as well as assessing ecosystem status, monitoring biodiversity and provid- ing inputs to conceive food risk monitoring systems. Common techniques to produce land cover maps from such VHSR images typically opt for a prior pansharpening of the multi-resolution source for a full resolution processing. Here, we propose a new deep learning architecture to jointly use PAN and MS imagery for a direct classification without any prior image fusion or resampling process. By managing the spectral information at its native spatial resolution, our method, named MRFusion, aims at avoiding the possible infor- mation loss induced by pansharpening or any other hand-crafted preprocessing. Moreover, the proposed architecture is suitably designed to learn non-linear transformations of the sources with the explicit aim of taking as much as possible advantage of the complementarity of PAN and MS imagery. Experiments are carried out on two-real world scenarios depicting large areas with different land cover characteristics. The characteristics of the proposed scenarios underline the applicability and the generality of our method in operational settings. 
### 584.Simplified Active Calibration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11468.pdf)
> We present a new mathematical formulation to estimate the intrinsic parameters of a camera in active or robotic platforms. We show that the focal lengths can be estimated using only one point correspondence that relates images taken before and after a degenerate rotation of the camera. The estimated focal lengths are then treated as known parameters to obtain a linear set of equations to calculate the principal point. Assuming that the principal point is close to the image center, the accuracy of the linear equations are increased by integrating the image center into the formulation. We extensively evaluate the formulations on a simulated camera, 3D scenes and real-world images. Our error analysis over simulated and real images indicates that the proposed Simplified Active Calibration method estimates the parameters of a camera with low error rates that can be used as an initial guess for further non-linear refinement procedures. Simplified Active Calibration can be employed in real-time environments for automatic calibrations given the proposed closed-form solutions. 
### 585.SynNet: Structure-Preserving Fully Convolutional Networks for Medical  Image Synthesis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11475.pdf)
> Cross modal image syntheses is gaining significant interests for its ability to estimate target images of a different modality from a given set of source images,like estimating MR to MR, MR to CT, CT to PET etc, without the need for an actual acquisition.Though they show potential for applications in radiation therapy planning,image super resolution, atlas construction, image segmentation etc.The synthesis results are not as accurate as the actual acquisition.In this paper,we address the problem of multi modal image synthesis by proposing a fully convolutional deep learning architecture called the SynNet.We extend the proposed architecture for various input output configurations. And finally, we propose a structure preserving custom loss function for cross-modal image synthesis.We validate the proposed SynNet and its extended framework on BRATS dataset with comparisons against three state-of-the art methods.And the results of the proposed custom loss function is validated against the traditional loss function used by the state-of-the-art methods for cross modal image synthesis. 
### 586.Recognition of Offline Handwritten Devanagari Numerals using Regional  Weighted Run Length Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11517.pdf)
> Recognition of handwritten Roman characters and numerals has been extensively studied in the last few decades and its accuracy reached to a satisfactory state. But the same cannot be said while talking about the Devanagari script which is one of most popular script in India. This paper proposes an efficient digit recognition system for handwritten Devanagari script. The system uses a novel 196-element Mask Oriented Directional (MOD) features for the recognition purpose. The methodology is tested using five conventional classifiers on 6000 handwritten digit samples. On applying 3-fold cross-validation scheme, the proposed system yields the highest recognition accuracy of 95.02% using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. 
### 587.Visual Attention and its Intimate Links to Spatial Cognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11530.pdf)
> It is almost universal to regard attention as the facility that permits an agent, human or machine, to give priority processing resources to relevant stimuli while ignoring the irrelevant. The reality of how this might manifest itself throughout all the forms of perceptual and cognitive processes possessed by humans, however, is not as clear. Here we examine this reality with a broad perspective in order to highlight the myriad ways that attentional processes impact both perception and cognition. The paper concludes by showing two real world problems that exhibit sufficient complexity to illustrate the ways in which attention and cognition connect. These then point to new avenues of research that might illuminate the overall cognitive architecture of spatial cognition. 
### 588.End-to-end Learning of Multi-sensor 3D Tracking by Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11534.pdf)
> In this paper we propose a novel approach to tracking by detection that can exploit both cameras as well as LIDAR data to produce very accurate 3D trajectories. Towards this goal, we formulate the problem as a linear program that can be solved exactly, and learn convolutional networks for detection as well as matching in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate our model in the challenging KITTI dataset and show very competitive results. 
### 589.Factorizable Net: An Efficient Subgraph-based Framework for Scene Graph  Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11538.pdf)
> Generating scene graph to describe all the relations inside an image gains increasing interests these years. However, most of the previous methods use complicated structures with slow inference speed or rely on the external data, which limits the usage of the model in real-life scenarios. To improve the efficiency of scene graph generation, we propose a subgraph-based connection graph to concisely represent the scene graph during the inference. A bottom-up clustering method is first used to factorize the entire scene graph into subgraphs, where each subgraph contains several objects and a subset of their relationships. By replacing the numerous relationship representations of the scene graph with fewer subgraph and object features, the computation in the intermediate stage is significantly reduced. In addition, spatial information is maintained by the subgraph features, which is leveraged by our proposed Spatial-weighted Message Passing~(SMP) structure and Spatial-sensitive Relation Inference~(SRI) module to facilitate the relationship recognition. On the recent Visual Relationship Detection and Visual Genome datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in both accuracy and speed. 
### 590.Following High-level Navigation Instructions on a Simulated Quadcopter  with Imitation Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00047.pdf)
> We introduce a method for following high-level navigation instructions by mapping directly from images, instructions and pose estimates to continuous low-level velocity commands for real-time control. The Grounded Semantic Mapping Network (GSMN) is a fully-differentiable neural network architecture that builds an explicit semantic map in the world reference frame by incorporating a pinhole camera projection model within the network. The information stored in the map is learned from experience, while the local-to-world transformation is computed explicitly. We train the model using DAggerFM, a modified variant of DAgger that trades tabular convergence guarantees for improved training speed and memory use. We test GSMN in virtual environments on a realistic quadcopter simulator and show that incorporating an explicit mapping and grounding modules allows GSMN to outperform strong neural baselines and almost reach an expert policy performance. Finally, we analyze the learned map representations and show that using an explicit map leads to an interpretable instruction-following model. 
### 591.PeerNets: Exploiting Peer Wisdom Against Adversarial Attacks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00088.pdf)
> Deep learning systems have become ubiquitous in many aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, it has been shown that such systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, making them prone to potential unlawful uses. Designing deep neural networks that are robust to adversarial attacks is a fundamental step in making such systems safer and deployable in a broader variety of applications (e.g. autonomous driving), but more importantly is a necessary step to design novel and more advanced architectures built on new computational paradigms rather than marginally building on the existing ones. In this paper we introduce PeerNets, a novel family of convolutional networks alternating classical Euclidean convolutions with graph convolutions to harness information from a graph of peer samples. This results in a form of non-local forward propagation in the model, where latent features are conditioned on the global structure induced by the graph, that is up to 3 times more robust to a variety of white- and black-box adversarial attacks compared to conventional architectures with almost no drop in accuracy. 
### 592.The Nonlinearity Coefficient - Predicting Overfitting in Deep Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00179.pdf)
> For a long time, designing neural architectures that exhibit high performance was considered a dark art that required expert hand-tuning. One of the few well-known guidelines for architecture design is the avoidance of exploding gradients, though even this guideline has remained relatively vague and circumstantial. We introduce the nonlinearity coefficient (NLC), a measurement of the complexity of the function computed by a neural network that is based on the magnitude of the gradient. Via an extensive empirical study, we show that the NLC is a powerful predictor of test error and that attaining a right-sized NLC is essential for optimal performance. <br />The NLC exhibits a range of intriguing and important properties. It is closely tied to the amount of information gained from computing a single network gradient. It is tied to the error incurred when replacing the nonlinearity operations in the network with linear operations. It is not susceptible to the confounders of multiplicative scaling, additive bias and layer width. It is stable from layer to layer. Hence, we argue that the NLC is the first robust predictor of overfitting in deep networks. 
### 593.Audio Visual Scene-Aware Dialog (AVSD) Challenge at DSTC7 [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00525.pdf)
> Scene-aware dialog systems will be able to have conversations with users about the objects and events around them. Progress on such systems can be made by integrating state-of-the-art technologies from multiple research areas including end-to-end dialog systems visual dialog, and video description. We introduce the Audio Visual Scene Aware Dialog (AVSD) challenge and dataset. In this challenge, which is one track of the 7th Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC7) workshop1, the task is to build a system that generates responses in a dialog about an input video 
### 594.CubeSLAM: Monocular 3D Object Detection and SLAM without Prior Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00557.pdf)
> We present a method for single image 3D cuboid object detection and multi-view object SLAM without prior object model, and demonstrate that the two aspects can benefit each other. For 3D detection, we generate high quality cuboid proposals from 2D bounding boxes and vanishing points sampling. The proposals are further scored and selected to align with image edges. Experiments on SUN RGBD and KITTI shows the efficiency and accuracy over existing approaches. Then in the second part, multi-view bundle adjustment with novel measurement functions is proposed to jointly optimize camera poses, objects and points, utilizing single view detection results. Objects can provide more geometric constraints and scale consistency compared to points. On the collected and public TUM and KITTI odometry datasets, we achieve better pose estimation accuracy over the state-of-the-art monocular SLAM while also improve the 3D object detection accuracy at the same time. 
### 595.Detecting Adversarial Examples via Key-based Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00580.pdf)
> Though deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in visual classification, recent studies have shown that they are all vulnerable to the attack of adversarial examples. Small and often imperceptible perturbations to the input images are sufficient to fool the most powerful deep neural networks. Various defense methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, they either require knowledge on the process of generating adversarial examples, or are not robust against new attacks specifically designed to penetrate the existing defense. In this work, we introduce key-based network, a new detection-based defense mechanism to distinguish adversarial examples from normal ones based on error correcting output codes, using the binary code vectors produced by multiple binary classifiers applied to randomly chosen label-sets as signatures to match normal images and reject adversarial examples. In contrast to existing defense methods, the proposed method does not require knowledge of the process for generating adversarial examples and can be applied to defend against different types of attacks. For the practical black-box and gray-box scenarios, where the attacker does not know the encoding scheme, we show empirically that key-based network can effectively detect adversarial examples generated by several state-of-the-art attacks. 
### 596.Nonlocal Neural Networks, Nonlocal Diffusion and Nonlocal Modeling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00681.pdf)
> Nonlocal neural networks have been proposed and shown to be effective in several computer vision tasks, where the nonlocal operations can directly capture long-range dependencies in the feature space. In this paper, we study the nature of diffusion and damping effect of nonlocal networks by doing the spectrum analysis on the weight matrices of the well-trained networks, and propose a new formulation of the nonlocal block. The new block not only learns the nonlocal interactions but also has stable dynamics and thus allows deeper nonlocal structures. Moreover, we interpret our formulation from the general nonlocal modeling perspective, where we make connections between the proposed nonlocal network and other nonlocal models, such as nonlocal diffusion processes and nonlocal Markov jump processes. 
### 597.Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks for Time Series  Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00685.pdf)
> Time series prediction has been studied in a variety of domains. However, it is still challenging to predict future series given historical observations and past exogenous data. Existing methods either fail to consider the interactions among different components of exogenous variables which may affect the prediction accuracy, or cannot model the correlations between exogenous data and target data. Besides, the inherent temporal dynamics of exogenous data are also related to the target series prediction, and thus should be considered as well. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model, i.e., Hierarchical attention-based Recurrent Highway Network (HRHN), which incorporates spatio-temporal feature extraction of exogenous variables and temporal dynamics modeling of target variables into a single framework. Moreover, by introducing the hierarchical attention mechanism, HRHN can adaptively select the relevant exogenous features in different semantic levels. We carry out comprehensive empirical evaluations with various methods over several datasets, and show that HRHN outperforms the state of the arts in time series prediction, especially in capturing sudden changes and sudden oscillations of time series. 
### 598.Contextualize, Show and Tell: A Neural Visual Storyteller [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00738.pdf)
> We present a neural model for generating short stories from image sequences, which extends the image description model by Vinyals et al. (Vinyals et al., 2015). This extension relies on an encoder LSTM to compute a context vector of each story from the image sequence. This context vector is used as the first state of multiple independent decoder LSTMs, each of which generates the portion of the story corresponding to each image in the sequence by taking the image embedding as the first input. Our model showed competitive results with the METEOR metric and human ratings in the internal track of the Visual Storytelling Challenge 2018. 
### 599.NAM: Non-Adversarial Unsupervised Domain Mapping [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00804.pdf)
> Several methods were recently proposed for the task of translating images between domains without prior knowledge in the form of correspondences. The existing methods apply adversarial learning to ensure that the distribution of the mapped source domain is indistinguishable from the target domain, which suffers from known stability issues. In addition, most methods rely heavily on `cycle' relationships between the domains, which enforce a one-to-one mapping. In this work, we introduce an alternative method: Non-Adversarial Mapping (NAM), which separates the task of target domain generative modeling from the cross-domain mapping task. NAM relies on a pre-trained generative model of the target domain, and aligns each source image with an image synthesized from the target domain, while jointly optimizing the domain mapping function. It has several key advantages: higher quality and resolution image translations, simpler and more stable training and reusable target models. Extensive experiments are presented validating the advantages of our method. 
### 600.Disconnected Manifold Learning for Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00880.pdf)
> Real images often lie on a union of disjoint manifolds rather than one globally connected manifold, and this can cause several difficulties for the training of common Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this work, we first show that single generator GANs are unable to correctly model a distribution supported on a disconnected manifold, and investigate how sample quality, mode collapse and local convergence are affected by this. Next, we show how using a collection of generators can address this problem, providing new insights into the success of such multi-generator GANs. Finally, we explain the serious issues caused by considering a fixed prior over the collection of generators and propose a novel approach for learning the prior and inferring the necessary number of generators without any supervision. Our proposed modifications can be applied on top of any other GAN model to enable learning of distributions supported on disconnected manifolds. We conduct several experiments to illustrate the aforementioned shortcoming of GANs, its consequences in practice, and the effectiveness of our proposed modifications in alleviating these issues. 
### 601.Infrastructure Quality Assessment in Africa using Satellite Imagery and  Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00894.pdf)
> The UN Sustainable Development Goals allude to the importance of infrastructure quality in three of its seventeen goals. However, monitoring infrastructure quality in developing regions remains prohibitively expensive and impedes efforts to measure progress toward these goals. To this end, we investigate the use of widely available remote sensing data for the prediction of infrastructure quality in Africa. We train a convolutional neural network to predict ground truth labels from the Afrobarometer Round 6 survey using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 satellite imagery. <br />Our best models predict infrastructure quality with AUROC scores of 0.881 on Electricity, 0.862 on Sewerage, 0.739 on Piped Water, and 0.786 on Roads using Landsat 8. These performances are significantly better than models that leverage OpenStreetMap or nighttime light intensity on the same tasks. We also demonstrate that our trained model can accurately make predictions in an unseen country after fine-tuning on a small sample of images. Furthermore, the model can be deployed in regions with limited samples to predict infrastructure outcomes with higher performance than nearest neighbor spatial interpolation. 
### 602.Semi-Supervised Clustering with Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01547.pdf)
> Clustering using neural networks has recently demonstrated promising performance in machine learning and computer vision applications. However, the performance of current approaches is limited either by unsupervised learning or their dependence on large set of labeled data samples. In this paper, we propose ClusterNet that uses pairwise semantic constraints from very few labeled data samples (&lt;5% of total data) and exploits the abundant unlabeled data to drive the clustering approach. We define a new loss function that uses pairwise semantic similarity between objects combined with constrained k-means clustering to efficiently utilize both labeled and unlabeled data in the same framework. The proposed network uses convolution autoencoder to learn a latent representation that groups data into k specified clusters, while also learning the cluster centers simultaneously. We evaluate and compare the performance of ClusterNet on several datasets and state of the art deep clustering approaches. 
### 603.On layer-level control of DNN training and its impact on generalization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01603.pdf)
> The generalization ability of a neural network depends on the optimization procedure used for training it. For practitioners and theoreticians, it is essential to identify which properties of the optimization procedure influence generalization. In this paper, we observe that prioritizing the training of distinct layers in a network significantly impacts its generalization ability, sometimes causing differences of up to 30% in test accuracy. In order to better monitor and control such prioritization, we propose to define layer-level training speed as the rotation rate of the layer's weight vector (denoted by layer rotation rate hereafter), and develop Layca, an optimization algorithm that enables direct control over it through each layer's learning rate parameter, without being affected by gradient propagation phenomena (e.g. vanishing gradients). We show that controlling layer rotation rates enables Layca to significantly outperform SGD with the same amount of learning rate tuning on three different tasks (up to 10% test error improvement). Furthermore, we provide experiments that suggest that several intriguing observations related to the training of deep models, i.e. the presence of plateaus in learning curves, the impact of weight decay, and the bad generalization properties of adaptive gradient methods, are all due to specific configurations of layer rotation rates. Overall, our work reveals that layer rotation rates are an important factor for generalization, and that monitoring it should be a key component of any deep learning experiment. 
### 604.Accelerating CNN inference on FPGAs: A Survey [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01683.pdf)
> Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are currently adopted to solve an ever greater number of problems, ranging from speech recognition to image classification and segmentation. The large amount of processing required by CNNs calls for dedicated and tailored hardware support methods. Moreover, CNN workloads have a streaming nature, well suited to reconfigurable hardware architectures such as FPGAs. The amount and diversity of research on the subject of CNN FPGA acceleration within the last 3 years demonstrates the tremendous industrial and academic interest. This paper presents a state-of-the-art of CNN inference accelerators over FPGAs. The computational workloads, their parallelism and the involved memory accesses are analyzed. At the level of neurons, optimizations of the convolutional and fully connected layers are explained and the performances of the different methods compared. At the network level, approximate computing and datapath optimization methods are covered and state-of-the-art approaches compared. The methods and tools investigated in this survey represent the recent trends in FPGA CNN inference accelerators and will fuel the future advances on efficient hardware deep learning. 
### 605.A Memristor based Unsupervised Neuromorphic System Towards Fast and  Energy-Efficient GAN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01775.pdf)
> Deep Learning has gained immense success in pushing today's artificial intelligence forward. To solve the challenge of limited labeled data in the supervised learning world, unsupervised learning has been proposed years ago while low accuracy hinters its realistic applications. Generative adversarial network (GAN) emerges as an unsupervised learning approach with promising accuracy and are under extensively study. However, the execution of GAN is extremely memory and computation intensive and results in ultra-low speed and high-power consumption. In this work, we proposed a holistic solution for fast and energy-efficient GAN computation through a memristor-based neuromorphic system. First, we exploited a hardware and software co-design approach to map the computation blocks in GAN efficiently. We also proposed an efficient data flow for optimal parallelism training and testing, depending on the computation correlations between different computing blocks. To compute the unique and complex loss of GAN, we developed a diff-block with optimized accuracy and performance. The experiment results on big data show that our design achieves 2.8x speedup and 6.1x energy-saving compared with the traditional GPU accelerator, as well as 5.5x speedup and 1.4x energy-saving compared with the previous FPGA-based accelerator. 
### 606.Sequential Attend, Infer, Repeat: Generative Modelling of Moving Objects [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01794.pdf)
> We present Sequential Attend, Infer, Repeat (SQAIR), an interpretable deep generative model for videos of moving objects. It can reliably discover and track objects throughout the sequence of frames, and can also generate future frames conditioning on the current frame, thereby simulating expected motion of objects. This is achieved by explicitly encoding object presence, locations and appearances in the latent variables of the model. SQAIR retains all strengths of its predecessor, Attend, Infer, Repeat (AIR, Eslami et. al., 2016), including learning in an unsupervised manner, and addresses its shortcomings. We use a moving multi-MNIST dataset to show limitations of AIR in detecting overlapping or partially occluded objects, and show how SQAIR overcomes them by leveraging temporal consistency of objects. Finally, we also apply SQAIR to real-world pedestrian CCTV data, where it learns to reliably detect, track and generate walking pedestrians with no supervision. 
### 607.Deep Algorithms: designs for networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02003.pdf)
> A new design methodology for neural networks that is guided by traditional algorithm design is presented. To prove our point, we present two heuristics and demonstrate an algorithmic technique for incorporating additional weights in their signal-flow graphs. We show that with training the performance of these networks can not only exceed the performance of the initial network, but can match the performance of more-traditional neural network architectures. A key feature of our approach is that these networks are initialized with parameters that provide a known performance threshold for the architecture on a given task. 
### 608.A Peek Into the Hidden Layers of a Convolutional Neural Network Through  a Factorization Lens [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02012.pdf)
> Despite their increasing popularity and success in a variety of supervised learning problems, deep neural networks are extremely hard to interpret and debug: Given and already trained Deep Neural Net, and a set of test inputs, how can we gain insight into how those inputs interact with different layers of the neural network? Furthermore, can we characterize a given deep neural network based on it's observed behavior on different inputs? In this paper we propose a novel factorization based approach on understanding how different deep neural networks operate. In our preliminary results, we identify fascinating patterns that link the factorization rank (typically used as a measure of interestingness in unsupervised data analysis) with how well or poorly the deep network has been trained. Finally, our proposed approach can help provide visual insights on how high-level. interpretable patterns of the network's input behave inside the hidden layers of the deep network. 
### 609.Corpus Conversion Service: A Machine Learning Platform to Ingest  Documents at Scale [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02284.pdf)
> Over the past few decades, the amount of scientific articles and technical literature has increased exponentially in size. Consequently, there is a great need for systems that can ingest these documents at scale and make the contained knowledge discoverable. Unfortunately, both the format of these documents (e.g. the PDF format or bitmap images) as well as the presentation of the data (e.g. complex tables) make the extraction of qualitative and quantitive data extremely challenging. In this paper, we present a modular, cloud-based platform to ingest documents at scale. This platform, called the Corpus Conversion Service (CCS), implements a pipeline which allows users to parse and annotate documents (i.e. collect ground-truth), train machine-learning classification algorithms and ultimately convert any type of PDF or bitmap-documents to a structured content representation format. We will show that each of the modules is scalable due to an asynchronous microservice architecture and can therefore handle massive amounts of documents. Furthermore, we will show that our capability to gather ground-truth is accelerated by machine-learning algorithms by at least one order of magnitude. This allows us to both gather large amounts of ground-truth in very little time and obtain very good precision/recall metrics in the range of 99\% with regard to content conversion to structured output. The CCS platform is currently deployed on IBM internal infrastructure and serving more than 250 active users for knowledge-engineering project engagements. 
### 610.Generative Adversarial Networks for Realistic Synthesis of Hyperspectral  Samples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02583.pdf)
> This work addresses the scarcity of annotated hyperspectral data required to train deep neural networks. Especially, we investigate generative adversarial networks and their application to the synthesis of consistent labeled spectra. By training such networks on public datasets, we show that these models are not only able to capture the underlying distribution, but also to generate genuine-looking and physically plausible spectra. Moreover, we experimentally validate that the synthetic samples can be used as an effective data augmentation strategy. We validate our approach on several public hyper-spectral datasets using a variety of deep classifiers. 
### 611.Semi-Supervised Learning via Compact Latent Space Clustering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02679.pdf)
> We present a novel cost function for semi-supervised learning of neural networks that encourages compact clustering of the latent space to facilitate separation. The key idea is to dynamically create a graph over embeddings of labeled and unlabeled samples of a training batch to capture underlying structure in feature space, and use label propagation to estimate its high and low density regions. We then devise a cost function based on Markov chains on the graph that regularizes the latent space to form a single compact cluster per class, while avoiding to disturb existing clusters during optimization. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks and compare to state-of-the art with promising results. Our approach combines the benefits of graph-based regularization with efficient, inductive inference, does not require modifications to a network architecture, and can thus be easily applied to existing networks to enable an effective use of unlabeled data. 
### 612.Training Faster by Separating Modes of Variation in Batch-normalized  Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02892.pdf)
> Batch Normalization (BN) is essential to effectively train state-of-the-art deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It normalizes inputs to the layers during training using the statistics of each mini-batch. In this work, we study BN from the viewpoint of Fisher kernels. We show that assuming samples within a mini-batch are from the same probability density function, then BN is identical to the Fisher vector of a Gaussian distribution. That means BN can be explained in terms of kernels that naturally emerge from the probability density function of the underlying data distribution. However, given the rectifying non-linearities employed in CNN architectures, distribution of inputs to the layers show heavy tail and asymmetric characteristics. Therefore, we propose approximating underlying data distribution not with one, but a mixture of Gaussian densities. Deriving Fisher vector for a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), reveals that BN can be improved by independently normalizing with respect to the statistics of disentangled sub-populations. We refer to our proposed soft piecewise version of BN as Mixture Normalization (MN). Through extensive set of experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we show that MN not only effectively accelerates training image classification and Generative Adversarial networks, but also reaches higher quality models. 
### 613.Color Sails: Discrete-Continuous Palettes for Deep Color Exploration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02918.pdf)
> We present color sails, a discrete-continuous color gamut representation that extends the color gradient analogy to three dimensions and allows interactive control of the color blending behavior. Our representation models a wide variety of color distributions in a compact manner, and lends itself to applications such as color exploration for graphic design, illustration and similar fields. We propose a Neural Network that can fit a color sail to any image. Then, the user can adjust color sail parameters to change the base colors, their blending behavior and the number of colors, exploring a wide range of options for the original design. In addition, we propose a Deep Learning model that learns to automatically segment an image into color-compatible alpha masks, each equipped with its own color sail. This allows targeted color exploration by either editing their corresponding color sails or using standard software packages. Our model is trained on a custom diverse dataset of art and design. We provide both quantitative evaluations, and a user study, demonstrating the effectiveness of color sail interaction. Interactive demos are available at www.colorsails.com. 
### 614.Representation Learning on Graphs with Jumping Knowledge Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03536.pdf)
> Recent deep learning approaches for representation learning on graphs follow a neighborhood aggregation procedure. We analyze some important properties of these models, and propose a strategy to overcome those. In particular, the range of "neighboring" nodes that a node's representation draws from strongly depends on the graph structure, analogous to the spread of a random walk. To adapt to local neighborhood properties and tasks, we explore an architecture -- jumping knowledge (JK) networks -- that flexibly leverages, for each node, different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware representation. In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation networks, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, combining the JK framework with models like Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks consistently improves those models' performance. 
### 615.Interactive Visual Grounding of Referring Expressions for Human-Robot  Interaction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03831.pdf)
> This paper presents INGRESS, a robot system that follows human natural language instructions to pick and place everyday objects. The core issue here is the grounding of referring expressions: infer objects and their relationships from input images and language expressions. INGRESS allows for unconstrained object categories and unconstrained language expressions. Further, it asks questions to disambiguate referring expressions interactively. To achieve these, we take the approach of grounding by generation and propose a two-stage neural network model for grounding. The first stage uses a neural network to generate visual descriptions of objects, compares them with the input language expression, and identifies a set of candidate objects. The second stage uses another neural network to examine all pairwise relations between the candidates and infers the most likely referred object. The same neural networks are used for both grounding and question generation for disambiguation. Experiments show that INGRESS outperformed a state-of-the-art method on the RefCOCO dataset and in robot experiments with humans. 
### 616.A Multi-task Deep Learning Architecture for Maritime Surveillance using  AIS Data Streams [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03972.pdf)
> In a world of global trading, maritime safety, security and efficiency are crucial issues. We propose a multi-task deep learning framework for vessel monitoring using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data streams. We combine recurrent neural networks with latent variable modeling and an embedding of AIS messages to a new representation space to jointly address key issues to be dealt with when considering AIS data streams: massive amount of streaming data, noisy data and irregular timesampling. We demonstrate the relevance of the proposed deep learning framework on real AIS datasets for a three-task setting, namely trajectory reconstruction, anomaly detection and vessel type identification. 
### 617.Learning to Decompose and Disentangle Representations for Video  Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04166.pdf)
> Our goal is to predict future video frames given a sequence of input frames. Despite large amounts of video data, this remains a challenging task because of the high-dimensionality of video frames. We address this challenge by proposing the Decompositional Disentangled Predictive Auto-Encoder (DDPAE), a framework that combines structured probabilistic models and deep networks to automatically (i) decompose the high-dimensional video that we aim to predict into components, and (ii) disentangle each component to have low-dimensional temporal dynamics that are easier to predict. Crucially, with an appropriately specified generative model of video frames, our DDPAE is able to learn both the latent decomposition and disentanglement without explicit supervision. For the Moving MNIST dataset, we show that DDPAE is able to recover the underlying components (individual digits) and disentanglement (appearance and location) as we would intuitively do. We further demonstrate that DDPAE can be applied to the Bouncing Balls dataset involving complex interactions between multiple objects to predict the video frame directly from the pixels and recover physical states without explicit supervision. 
### 618.Physical Representation-based Predicate Optimization for a Visual  Analytics Database [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04226.pdf)
> Querying the content of images, video, and other non-textual data sources requires expensive content extraction methods. Modern extraction techniques are based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and can classify objects within images with astounding accuracy. Unfortunately, these methods are slow: processing a single image can take about 10 milliseconds on modern GPU-based hardware. As massive video libraries become ubiquitous, running a content-based query over millions of video frames is prohibitive. <br />One promising approach to reduce the runtime cost of queries of visual content is to use a hierarchical model, such as a cascade, where simple cases are handled by an inexpensive classifier. Prior work has sought to design cascades that optimize the computational cost of inference by, for example, using smaller CNNs. However, we observe that there are critical factors besides the inference time that dramatically impact the overall query time. Notably, by treating the physical representation of the input image as part of our query optimization---that is, by including image transforms, such as resolution scaling or color-depth reduction, within the cascade---we can optimize data handling costs and enable drastically more efficient classifier cascades. <br />In this paper, we propose Tahoma, which generates and evaluates many potential classifier cascades that jointly optimize the CNN architecture and input data representation. Our experiments on a subset of ImageNet show that Tahoma's input transformations speed up cascades by up to 35 times. We also find up to a 98x speedup over the ResNet50 classifier with no loss in accuracy, and a 280x speedup if some accuracy is sacrificed. 
### 619.iParaphrasing: Extracting Visually Grounded Paraphrases via an Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04284.pdf)
> A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text in other words. Paraphrases have been studied to enhance the performance of many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel task iParaphrasing to extract visually grounded paraphrases (VGPs), which are different phrasal expressions describing the same visual concept in an image. These extracted VGPs have the potential to improve language and image multimodal tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. How to model the similarity between VGPs is the key of iParaphrasing. We apply various existing methods as well as propose a novel neural network-based method with image attention, and report the results of the first attempt toward iParaphrasing. 
### 620.Combining Model-Free Q-Ensembles and Model-Based Approaches for Informed  Exploration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04552.pdf)
> Q-Ensembles are a model-free approach where input images are fed into different Q-networks and exploration is driven by the assumption that uncertainty is proportional to the variance of the output Q-values obtained. They have been shown to perform relatively well compared to other exploration strategies. Further, model-based approaches, such as encoder-decoder models have been used successfully for next frame prediction given previous frames. This paper proposes to integrate the model-free Q-ensembles and model-based approaches with the hope of compounding the benefits of both and achieving superior exploration as a result. Results show that a model-based trajectory memory approach when combined with Q-ensembles produces superior performance when compared to only using Q-ensembles. 
### 621.Reservoir Computing Hardware with Cellular Automata [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04932.pdf)
> Elementary cellular automata (ECA) is a widely studied one-dimensional processing methodology where the successive iteration of the automaton may lead to the recreation of a rich pattern dynamic. Recently, cellular automata have been proposed as a feasible way to implement Reservoir Computing (RC) systems in which the automata rule is fixed and the training is performed using a linear regression. In this work we perform an exhaustive study of the performance of the different ECA rules when applied to pattern recognition of time-independent input signals using a RC scheme. Once the different ECA rules have been tested, the most accurate one (rule 90) is selected to implement a digital circuit. Rule 90 is easily reproduced using a reduced set of XOR gates and shift-registers, thus representing a high-performance alternative for RC hardware implementation in terms of processing time, circuit area, power dissipation and system accuracy. The model (both in software and its hardware implementation) has been tested using a pattern recognition task of handwritten numbers (the MNIST database) for which we obtained competitive results in terms of accuracy, speed and power dissipation. The proposed model can be considered to be a low-cost method to implement fast pattern recognition digital circuits. 
### 622.Convolutional sparse coding for capturing high speed video content [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04935.pdf)
> Video capture is limited by the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution: when capturing videos of high temporal resolution, the spatial resolution decreases due to bandwidth limitations in the capture system. Achieving both high spatial and temporal resolution is only possible with highly specialized and very expensive hardware, and even then the same basic trade-off remains. The recent introduction of compressive sensing and sparse reconstruction techniques allows for the capture of single-shot high-speed video, by coding the temporal information in a single frame, and then reconstructing the full video sequence from this single coded image and a trained dictionary of image patches. In this paper, we first analyze this approach, and find insights that help improve the quality of the reconstructed videos. We then introduce a novel technique, based on convolutional sparse coding (CSC), and show how it outperforms the state-of-the-art, patch-based approach in terms of flexibility and efficiency, due to the convolutional nature of its filter banks. The key idea for CSC high-speed video acquisition is extending the basic formulation by imposing an additional constraint in the temporal dimension, which enforces sparsity of the first-order derivatives over time. 
### 623.Visually grounded cross-lingual keyword spotting in speech [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05030.pdf)
> Recent work considered how images paired with speech can be used as supervision for building speech systems when transcriptions are not available. We ask whether visual grounding can be used for cross-lingual keyword spotting: given a text keyword in one language, the task is to retrieve spoken utterances containing that keyword in another language. This could enable searching through speech in a low-resource language using text queries in a high-resource language. As a proof-of-concept, we use English speech with German queries: we use a German visual tagger to add keyword labels to each training image, and then train a neural network to map English speech to German keywords. Without seeing parallel speech-transcriptions or translations, the model achieves a precision at ten of 58%. We show that most erroneous retrievals contain equivalent or semantically relevant keywords; excluding these would improve P@10 to 91%. 
### 624.Online Self-supervised Scene Segmentation for Micro Aerial Vehicles [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05269.pdf)
> Recently, there have been numerous advances in the development of payload and power constrained lightweight Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). As these robots aspire for high-speed autonomous flights in complex dynamic environments, robust scene understanding at long-range becomes critical. The problem is heavily characterized by either the limitations imposed by sensor capabilities for geometry-based methods, or the need for large-amounts of manually annotated training data required by data-driven methods. This motivates the need to build systems that have the capability to alleviate these problems by exploiting the complimentary strengths of both geometry and data-driven methods. In this paper, we take a step in this direction and propose a generic framework for adaptive scene segmentation using self-supervised online learning. We present this in the context of vision-based autonomous MAV flight, and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed system through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world field tests. 
### 625.Hierarchical interpretations for neural network predictions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05337.pdf)
> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive predictive performance due to their ability to learn complex, non-linear relationships between variables. However, the inability to effectively visualize these relationships has led to DNNs being characterized as black boxes and consequently limited their applications. To ameliorate this problem, we introduce the use of hierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions through our proposed method, agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD). Given a prediction from a trained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features, along with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This hierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned are predictive. Using examples from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet, we show that ACD is effective at diagnosing incorrect predictions and identifying dataset bias. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD enables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better trust a DNN's outputs. We also find that ACD's hierarchy is largely robust to adversarial perturbations, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the input and ignores spurious noise. 
### 626.Improving Consistency-Based Semi-Supervised Learning with Weight  Averaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05594.pdf)
> Recent advances in deep unsupervised learning have renewed interest in semi-supervised methods, which can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. Presently the most successful approaches to semi-supervised learning are based on consistency regularization, whereby a model is trained to be robust to small perturbations of its inputs and parameters. We show that consistency regularization leads to flatter but narrower optima. We also show that the test error surface for these methods is approximately convex in regions of weight space traversed by SGD. Inspired by these observations, we propose to train consistency based semi-supervised models with stochastic weight averaging (SWA), a recent method which averages weights along the trajectory of SGD. We also develop fast-SWA, which further accelerates convergence by averaging multiple points within each cycle of a cyclical learning rate schedule. With fast-SWA we achieve the best known semi-supervised results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 over many different numbers of observed training labels. For example, we achieve 95.0% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 4000 labels, compared to the previous best result in the literature of 93.7%. We also improve the best known accuracy for domain adaptation from CIFAR-10 to STL from 80% to 83%. Finally, we show that with fast-SWA the simple $\Pi$ model becomes state-of-the-art for large labeled settings. 
### 627.VoxCeleb2: Deep Speaker Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05622.pdf)
> The objective of this paper is speaker recognition under noisy and unconstrained conditions. <br />We make two key contributions. First, we introduce a very large-scale audio-visual speaker recognition dataset collected from open-source media. Using a fully automated pipeline, we curate VoxCeleb2 which contains over a million utterances from over 6,000 speakers. This is several times larger than any publicly available speaker recognition dataset. <br />Second, we develop and compare Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and training strategies that can effectively recognise identities from voice under various conditions. The models trained on the VoxCeleb2 dataset surpass the performance of previous works on a benchmark dataset by a significant margin. 
### 628.Grounded Textual Entailment [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05645.pdf)
> Capturing semantic relations between sentences, such as entailment, is a long-standing challenge for computational semantics. Logic-based models analyse entailment in terms of possible worlds (interpretations, or situations) where a premise P entails a hypothesis H iff in all worlds where P is true, H is also true. Statistical models view this relationship probabilistically, addressing it in terms of whether a human would likely infer H from P. In this paper, we wish to bridge these two perspectives, by arguing for a visually-grounded version of the Textual Entailment task. Specifically, we ask whether models can perform better if, in addition to P and H, there is also an image (corresponding to the relevant "world" or "situation"). We use a multimodal version of the SNLI dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) and we compare "blind" and visually-augmented models of textual entailment. We show that visual information is beneficial, but we also conduct an in-depth error analysis that reveals that current multimodal models are not performing "grounding" in an optimal fashion. 
### 629.GLoMo: Unsupervisedly Learned Relational Graphs as Transferable  Representations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05662.pdf)
> Modern deep transfer learning approaches have mainly focused on learning generic feature vectors from one task that are transferable to other tasks, such as word embeddings in language and pretrained convolutional features in vision. However, these approaches usually transfer unary features and largely ignore more structured graphical representations. This work explores the possibility of learning generic latent relational graphs that capture dependencies between pairs of data units (e.g., words or pixels) from large-scale unlabeled data and transferring the graphs to downstream tasks. Our proposed transfer learning framework improves performance on various tasks including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and image classification. We also show that the learned graphs are generic enough to be transferred to different embeddings on which the graphs have not been trained (including GloVe embeddings, ELMo embeddings, and task-specific RNN hidden unit), or embedding-free units such as image pixels. 
### 630.Real-time Monocular Visual Odometry for Turbid and Dynamic Underwater  Environments [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05842.pdf)
> In the context of robotic underwater operations, the visual degradations induced by the medium properties make difficult the exclusive use of cameras for localization purpose. Hence, most localization methods are based on expensive navigational sensors associated with acoustic positioning. On the other hand, visual odometry and visual SLAM have been exhaustively studied for aerial or terrestrial applications, but state-of-the-art algorithms fail underwater. In this paper we tackle the problem of using a simple low-cost camera for underwater localization and propose a new monocular visual odometry method dedicated to the underwater environment. We evaluate different tracking methods and show that optical flow based tracking is more suited to underwater images than classical approaches based on descriptors. We also propose a keyframe-based visual odometry approach highly relying on nonlinear optimization. The proposed algorithm has been assessed on both simulated and real underwater datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art visual SLAM methods under many of the most challenging conditions. The main application of this work is the localization of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) used for underwater archaeological missions but the developed system can be used in any other applications as long as visual information is available. 
### 631.Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05978.pdf)
> We introduce Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BayesCNNs), a variant of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which is built upon Bayes by Backprop. We demonstrate how this novel reliable variational inference method can serve as a fundamental construct for various network architectures. On multiple datasets in supervised learning settings (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10), our proposed variational inference method achieves performances equivalent to frequentist inference in identical architectures, while a measurement for uncertainties and a regularisation are incorporated naturally. In the past, Bayes by Backprop has been successfully implemented in feedforward and recurrent neural networks, but not in convolutional ones. This work symbolises the extension of Bayesian neural networks which encompasses all three aforementioned types of network architectures now. 
### 632.Learning Factorized Multimodal Representations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06176.pdf)
> Learning representations of multimodal data is a fundamentally complex research problem due to the presence of multiple sources of information. To address the complexities of multimodal data, we argue that suitable representation learning models should: 1) factorize representations according to independent factors of variation in the data, capture important features for both 2) discriminative and 3) generative tasks, and 4) couple both modality-specific and multimodal information. To encapsulate all these properties, we propose the Multimodal Factorization Model (MFM) that factorizes multimodal representations into two sets of independent factors: multimodal discriminative factors and modality-specific generative factors. Multimodal discriminative factors are shared across all modalities and contain joint multimodal features required for discriminative tasks such as predicting sentiment. Modality-specific generative factors are unique for each modality and contain the information required for generating data. Our experimental results show that our model is able to learn meaningful multimodal representations and achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on five multimodal datasets. Our model also demonstrates flexible generative capabilities by conditioning on the independent factors. We further interpret our factorized representations to understand the interactions that influence multimodal learning. 
### 633.Multimodal Sentiment Analysis using Hierarchical Fusion with Context  Modeling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06228.pdf)
> Multimodal sentiment analysis is a very actively growing field of research. A promising area of opportunity in this field is to improve the multimodal fusion mechanism. We present a novel feature fusion strategy that proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first fusing the modalities two in two and only then fusing all three modalities. On multimodal sentiment analysis of individual utterances, our strategy outperforms conventional concatenation of features by 1%, which amounts to 5% reduction in error rate. On utterance-level multimodal sentiment analysis of multi-utterance video clips, for which current state-of-the-art techniques incorporate contextual information from other utterances of the same clip, our hierarchical fusion gives up to 2.4% (almost 10% error rate reduction) over currently used concatenation. The implementation of our method is publicly available in the form of open-source code. 
### 634.Right for the Right Reason: Training Agnostic Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06296.pdf)
> We consider the problem of a neural network being requested to classify images (or other inputs) without making implicit use of a "protected concept", that is a concept that should not play any role in the decision of the network. Typically these concepts include information such as gender or race, or other contextual information such as image backgrounds that might be implicitly reflected in unknown correlations with other variables, making it insufficient to simply remove them from the input features. In other words, making accurate predictions is not good enough if those predictions rely on information that should not be used: predictive performance is not the only important metric for learning systems. We apply a method developed in the context of domain adaptation to address this problem of "being right for the right reason", where we request a classifier to make a decision in a way that is entirely 'agnostic' to a given protected concept (e.g. gender, race, background etc.), even if this could be implicitly reflected in other attributes via unknown correlations. After defining the concept of an 'agnostic model', we demonstrate how the Domain-Adversarial Neural Network can remove unwanted information from a model using a gradient reversal layer. 
### 635.Deformable Generator Network: Unsupervised Disentanglement of Appearance  and Geometry [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06298.pdf)
> We propose a deformable generator model to disentangle the appearance and geometric information from images into two independent latent vectors. The appearance generator produces the appearance information, including color, illumination, identity or category, of an image. The geometric generator produces displacement of the coordinates of each pixel and performs geometric warping, such as stretching and rotation, on the appearance generator to obtain the final synthesized image. The proposed model can learn both representations from image data in an unsupervised manner. The learned geometric generator can be conveniently transferred to the other image datasets to facilitate downstream AI tasks. 
### 636.The RBO Dataset of Articulated Objects and Interactions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06465.pdf)
> We present a dataset with models of 14 articulated objects commonly found in human environments and with RGB-D video sequences and wrenches recorded of human interactions with them. The 358 interaction sequences total 67 minutes of human manipulation under varying experimental conditions (type of interaction, lighting, perspective, and background). Each interaction with an object is annotated with the ground truth poses of its rigid parts and the kinematic state obtained by a motion capture system. For a subset of 78 sequences (25 minutes), we also measured the interaction wrenches. The object models contain textured three-dimensional triangle meshes of each link and their motion constraints. We provide Python scripts to download and visualize the data. The data is available at <a href="https://tu-rbo.github.io/articulated-objects/">this https URL</a> and hosted at <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1036660/.">this https URL</a> 
### 637.Coupled Fluid Density and Motion from Single Views [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06613.pdf)
> We present a novel method to reconstruct a fluid's 3D density and motion based on just a single sequence of images. This is rendered possible by using powerful physical priors for this strongly under-determined problem. More specifically, we propose a novel strategy to infer density updates strongly coupled to previous and current estimates of the flow motion. Additionally, we employ an accurate discretization and depth-based regularizers to compute stable solutions. Using only one view for the reconstruction reduces the complexity of the capturing setup drastically and could even allow for online video databases or smart-phone videos as inputs. The reconstructed 3D velocity can then be flexibly utilized, e.g., for re-simulation, domain modification or guiding purposes. We will demonstrate the capacity of our method with a series of synthetic test cases and the reconstruction of real smoke plumes captured with a Raspberry Pi camera. 
### 638.Understanding Patch-Based Learning by Explaining Predictions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06926.pdf)
> Deep networks are able to learn highly predictive models of video data. Due to video length, a common strategy is to train them on small video snippets. We apply the deep Taylor / LRP technique to understand the deep network's classification decisions, and identify a "border effect": a tendency of the classifier to look mainly at the bordering frames of the input. This effect relates to the step size used to build the video snippet, which we can then tune in order to improve the classifier's accuracy without retraining the model. To our knowledge, this is the the first work to apply the deep Taylor / LRP technique on any video analyzing neural network. 
### 639.Auto-Meta: Automated Gradient Based Meta Learner Search [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06927.pdf)
> Fully automating machine learning pipeline is one of the outstanding challenges of general artificial intelligence, as practical machine learning often requires costly human driven process, such as hyper-parameter tuning, algorithmic selection, and model selection. In this work, we consider the problem of executing automated, yet scalable search for finding optimal gradient based meta-learners in practice. As a solution, we apply progressive neural architecture search to proto-architectures by appealing to the model agnostic nature of general gradient based meta learners. In the presence of recent universality result of Finn \textit{et al.}\cite{finn:universality_maml:DBLP:/journals/corr/abs-1710-11622}, our search is a priori motivated in that neural network architecture search dynamics---automated or not---may be quite different from that of the classical setting with the same target tasks, due to the presence of the gradient update operator. A posteriori, our search algorithm, given appropriately designed search spaces, finds gradient based meta learners with non-intuitive proto-architectures that are narrowly deep, unlike the inception-like structures previously observed in the resulting architectures of traditional NAS algorithms. Along with these notable findings, the searched gradient based meta-learner achieves state-of-the-art results on the few shot classification problem on Mini-ImageNet with $76.29\%$ accuracy, which is an $13.18\%$ improvement over results reported in the original MAML paper. To our best knowledge, this work is the first successful AutoML implementation in the context of meta learning. 
### 640.Semantic Image Retrieval by Uniting Deep Neural Networks and Cognitive  Architectures [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06946.pdf)
> Image and video retrieval by their semantic content has been an important and challenging task for years, because it ultimately requires bridging the symbolic/subsymbolic gap. Recent successes in deep learning enabled detection of objects belonging to many classes greatly outperforming traditional computer vision techniques. However, deep learning solutions capable of executing retrieval queries are still not available. We propose a hybrid solution consisting of a deep neural network for object detection and a cognitive architecture for query execution. Specifically, we use YOLOv2 and OpenCog. Queries allowing the retrieval of video frames containing objects of specified classes and specified spatial arrangement are implemented. 
### 641.Mixed batches and symmetric discriminators for GAN training [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07185.pdf)
> Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are pow- erful generative models based on providing feed- back to a generative network via a discriminator network. However, the discriminator usually as- sesses individual samples. This prevents the dis- criminator from accessing global distributional statistics of generated samples, and often leads to mode dropping: the generator models only part of the target distribution. We propose to feed the discriminator with mixed batches of true and fake samples, and train it to predict the ratio of true samples in the batch. The latter score does not depend on the order of samples in a batch. Rather than learning this invariance, we introduce a generic permutation-invariant discriminator ar- chitecture. This architecture is provably a uni- versal approximator of all symmetric functions. Experimentally, our approach reduces mode col- lapse in GANs on two synthetic datasets, and obtains good results on the CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets, both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
### 642.Wall Stress Estimation of Cerebral Aneurysm based on Zernike  Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07441.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have demonstrated an exceptional capacity to discern visual patterns from digital images and signals. Unfortunately, such powerful ConvNets do not generalize well to arbitrary-shaped manifolds, where data representation does not fit into a tensor-like grid. Hence, many fields of science and engineering, where data points possess some manifold structure, cannot enjoy the full benefits of the recent advances in ConvNets. The aneurysm wall stress estimation problem introduced in this paper is one of many such problems. The problem is well-known to be of a paramount clinical importance, but yet, traditional ConvNets cannot be applied due to the manifold structure of the data, neither does the state-of-the-art geometric ConvNets perform well. Motivated by this, we propose a new geometric ConvNet method named ZerNet, which builds upon our novel mathematical generalization of convolution and pooling operations on manifolds. Our study shows that the ZerNet outperforms the other state-of-the-art geometric ConvNets in terms of accuracy. 
### 643.Binary Ensemble Neural Network: More Bits per Network or More Networks  per Bit? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07550.pdf)
> Binary neural networks (BNN) have been studied extensively since they run dramatically faster at lower memory and power consumption than floating-point networks, thanks to the efficiency of bit operations. However, contemporary BNNs whose weights and activations are both single bits suffer from severe accuracy degradation. To understand why, we investigate the representation ability, speed and bias/variance of BNNs through extensive experiments. We conclude that the error of BNNs is predominantly caused by the intrinsic instability (training time) and non-robustness (train \&amp; test time). Inspired by this investigation, we propose the Binary Ensemble Neural Network (BENN) which leverages ensemble methods to improve the performance of BNNs with limited efficiency cost. While ensemble techniques have been broadly believed to be only marginally helpful for strong classifiers such as deep neural networks, our analyses and experiments show that they are naturally a perfect fit to boost BNNs. We find that our BENN, which is faster and much more robust than state-of-the-art binary networks, can even surpass the accuracy of the full-precision floating number network with the same architecture. 
### 644.Doubly Nested Network for Resource-Efficient Inference [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07568.pdf)
> We propose doubly nested network(DNNet) where all neurons represent their own sub-models that solve the same task. Every sub-model is nested both layer-wise and channel-wise. While nesting sub-models layer-wise is straight-forward with deep-supervision as proposed in \cite{xie2015holistically}, channel-wise nesting has not been explored in the literature to our best knowledge. Channel-wise nesting is non-trivial as neurons between consecutive layers are all connected to each other. In this work, we introduce a technique to solve this problem by sorting channels topologically and connecting neurons accordingly. For the purpose, channel-causal convolutions are used. Slicing doubly nested network gives a working sub-network. The most notable application of our proposed network structure with slicing operation is resource-efficient inference. At test time, computing resources such as time and memory available for running the prediction algorithm can significantly vary across devices and applications. Given a budget constraint, we can slice the network accordingly and use a sub-model for inference within budget, requiring no additional computation such as training or fine-tuning after deployment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several practical scenarios of utilizing available resource efficiently. 
### 645.An empirical study on evaluation metrics of generative adversarial  networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07755.pdf)
> Evaluating generative adversarial networks (GANs) is inherently challenging. In this paper, we revisit several representative sample-based evaluation metrics for GANs, and address the problem of how to evaluate the evaluation metrics. We start with a few necessary conditions for metrics to produce meaningful scores, such as distinguishing real from generated samples, identifying mode dropping and mode collapsing, and detecting overfitting. With a series of carefully designed experiments, we comprehensively investigate existing sample-based metrics and identify their strengths and limitations in practical settings. Based on these results, we observe that kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the 1-Nearest-Neighbor (1-NN) two-sample test seem to satisfy most of the desirable properties, provided that the distances between samples are computed in a suitable feature space. Our experiments also unveil interesting properties about the behavior of several popular GAN models, such as whether they are memorizing training samples, and how far they are from learning the target distribution. 
### 646.Accurate and Diverse Sampling of Sequences based on a &quot;Best of Many&quot;  Sample Objective [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07772.pdf)
> For autonomous agents to successfully operate in the real world, anticipation of future events and states of their environment is a key competence. This problem has been formalized as a sequence extrapolation problem, where a number of observations are used to predict the sequence into the future. Real-world scenarios demand a model of uncertainty of such predictions, as predictions become increasingly uncertain -- in particular on long time horizons. While impressive results have been shown on point estimates, scenarios that induce multi-modal distributions over future sequences remain challenging. Our work addresses these challenges in a Gaussian Latent Variable model for sequence prediction. Our core contribution is a "Best of Many" sample objective that leads to more accurate and more diverse predictions that better capture the true variations in real-world sequence data. Beyond our analysis of improved model fit, our models also empirically outperform prior work on three diverse tasks ranging from traffic scenes to weather data. 
### 647.Learning Neural Parsers with Deterministic Differentiable Imitation  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07822.pdf)
> We address the problem of spatial segmentation of a 2D object in the context of a robotic system for painting, where an optimal segmentation depends on both the appearance of the object and the size of each segment. Since each segment must take into account appearance features at several scales, we take a hierarchical grammar-based parsing approach to decompose the object into 2D segments for painting. Since there are many ways to segment an object the solution space is extremely large and it is very challenging to utilize an exploration based optimization approach like reinforcement learning. Instead, we pose the segmentation problem as an imitation learning problem by using a segmentation algorithm in the place of an expert, that has access to a small dataset with known foreground-background segmentations. During the imitation learning process, we learn to imitate the oracle (segmentation algorithm) using only the image of the object, without the use of the known foreground-background segmentations. We introduce a novel deterministic policy gradient update, DRAG, in the form of a deterministic actor-critic variant of AggreVaTeD, to train our neural network based object parser. We will also show that our approach can be seen as extending DDPG to the Imitation Learning scenario. Training our neural parser to imitate the oracle via DRAG allow our neural parser to outperform several existing imitation learning approaches. 
### 648.Edge Intelligence: On-Demand Deep Learning Model Co-Inference with  Device-Edge Synergy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07840.pdf)
> As the backbone technology of machine learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) have have quickly ascended to the spotlight. Running DNNs on resource-constrained mobile devices is, however, by no means trivial, since it incurs high performance and energy overhead. While offloading DNNs to the cloud for execution suffers unpredictable performance, due to the uncontrolled long wide-area network latency. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Edgent, a collaborative and on-demand DNN co-inference framework with device-edge synergy. Edgent pursues two design knobs: (1) DNN partitioning that adaptively partitions DNN computation between device and edge, in order to leverage hybrid computation resources in proximity for real-time DNN inference. (2) DNN right-sizing that accelerates DNN inference through early-exit at a proper intermediate DNN layer to further reduce the computation latency. The prototype implementation and extensive evaluations based on Raspberry Pi demonstrate Edgent's effectiveness in enabling on-demand low-latency edge intelligence. 
### 649.iMapper: Interaction-guided Joint Scene and Human Motion Mapping from  Monocular Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07889.pdf)
> A long-standing challenge in scene analysis is the recovery of scene arrangements under moderate to heavy occlusion, directly from monocular video. While the problem remains a subject of active research, concurrent advances have been made in the context of human pose reconstruction from monocular video, including image-space feature point detection and 3D pose recovery. These methods, however, start to fail under moderate to heavy occlusion as the problem becomes severely under-constrained. We approach the problems differently. We observe that people interact similarly in similar scenes. Hence, we exploit the correlation between scene object arrangement and motions performed in that scene in both directions: first, typical motions performed when interacting with objects inform us about possible object arrangements; and second, object arrangements, in turn, constrain the possible motions. <br />We present iMapper, a data-driven method that focuses on identifying human-object interactions, and jointly reasons about objects and human movement over space-time to recover both a plausible scene arrangement and consistent human interactions. We first introduce the notion of characteristic interactions as regions in space-time when an informative human-object interaction happens. This is followed by a novel occlusion-aware matching procedure that searches and aligns such characteristic snapshots from an interaction database to best explain the input monocular video. Through extensive evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, we demonstrate that iMapper significantly improves performance over both dedicated state-of-the-art scene analysis and 3D human pose recovery approaches, especially under medium to heavy occlusion. 
### 650.Como funciona o Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07908.pdf)
> Deep Learning methods are currently the state-of-the-art in many problems which can be tackled via machine learning, in particular classification problems. However there is still lack of understanding on how those methods work, why they work and what are the limitations involved in using them. In this chapter we will describe in detail the transition from shallow to deep networks, include examples of code on how to implement them, as well as the main issues one faces when training a deep network. Afterwards, we introduce some theoretical background behind the use of deep models, and discuss their limitations. 
### 651.Gradient Adversarial Training of Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08028.pdf)
> We propose gradient adversarial training, an auxiliary deep learning framework applicable to different machine learning problems. In gradient adversarial training, we leverage a prior belief that in many contexts, simultaneous gradient updates should be statistically indistinguishable from each other. We enforce this consistency using an auxiliary network that classifies the origin of the gradient tensor, and the main network serves as an adversary to the auxiliary network in addition to performing standard task-based training. We demonstrate gradient adversarial training for three different scenarios: (1) as a defense to adversarial examples we classify gradient tensors and tune them to be agnostic to the class of their corresponding example, (2) for knowledge distillation, we do binary classification of gradient tensors derived from the student or teacher network and tune the student gradient tensor to mimic the teacher's gradient tensor; and (3) for multi-task learning we classify the gradient tensors derived from different task loss functions and tune them to be statistically indistinguishable. For each of the three scenarios we show the potential of gradient adversarial training procedure. Specifically, gradient adversarial training increases the robustness of a network to adversarial attacks, is able to better distill the knowledge from a teacher network to a student network compared to soft targets, and boosts multi-task learning by aligning the gradient tensors derived from the task specific loss functions. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that gradient tensors contain latent information about whatever tasks are being trained, and can support diverse machine learning problems when intelligently guided through adversarialization using a auxiliary network. 
### 652.Flexible Neural Representation for Physics Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08047.pdf)
> Humans have a remarkable capacity to understand the physical dynamics of objects in their environment, flexibly capturing complex structures and interactions at multiple levels of detail. Inspired by this ability, we propose a hierarchical particle-based object representation that covers a wide variety of types of three-dimensional objects, including both arbitrary rigid geometrical shapes and deformable materials. We then describe the Hierarchical Relation Network (HRN), an end-to-end differentiable neural network based on hierarchical graph convolution, that learns to predict physical dynamics in this representation. Compared to other neural network baselines, the HRN accurately handles complex collisions and nonrigid deformations, generating plausible dynamics predictions at long time scales in novel settings, and scaling to large scene configurations. These results demonstrate an architecture with the potential to form the basis of next-generation physics predictors for use in computer vision, robotics, and quantitative cognitive science. 
### 653.Topological Data Analysis Made Easy with the Topology ToolKit [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08126.pdf)
> This tutorial presents topological methods for the analysis and visualization of scientific data from a user's perspective, with the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a recently released open-source library for topological data analysis. Topological methods have gained considerably in popularity and maturity over the last twenty years and success stories of established methods have been documented in a wide range of applications (combustion, chemistry, astrophysics, material sciences, etc.) with both acquired and simulated data, in both post-hoc and in-situ contexts. While reference textbooks have been published on the topic, no tutorial at IEEE VIS has covered this area in recent years, and never at a software level and from a user's point-of-view. This tutorial fills this gap by providing a beginner's introduction to topological methods for practitioners, researchers, students, and lecturers. In particular, instead of focusing on theoretical aspects and algorithmic details, this tutorial focuses on how topological methods can be useful in practice for concrete data analysis tasks such as segmentation, feature extraction or tracking. The tutorial describes in detail how to achieve these tasks with TTK. First, after an introduction to topological methods and their application in data analysis, a brief overview of TTK's main entry point for end users, namely ParaView, will be presented. Second, an overview of TTK's main features will be given. A running example will be described in detail, showcasing how to access TTK's features via ParaView, Python, VTK/C++, and C++. Third, hands-on sessions will concretely show how to use TTK in ParaView for multiple, representative data analysis tasks. Fourth, the usage of TTK will be presented for developers, in particular by describing several examples of visualization and data analysis projects that were built on top of TTK. Finally, some feedback regarding the usage of TTK as a teaching platform for topological analysis will be given. Presenters of this tutorial include experts in topological methods, core authors of TTK as well as active users, coming from academia, labs, or industry. A large part of the tutorial will be dedicated to hands-on exercises and a rich material package (including TTK pre-installs in virtual machines, code, data, demos, video tutorials, etc.) will be provided to the participants. This tutorial mostly targets students, practitioners and researchers who are not experts in topological methods but who are interested in using them in their daily tasks. We also target researchers already familiar to topological methods and who are interested in using or contributing to TTK. 
### 654.Finding Person Relations in Image Data of the Internet Archive [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08246.pdf)
> The multimedia content in the World Wide Web is rapidly growing and contains valuable information for many applications in different domains. For this reason, the Internet Archive initiative has been gathering billions of time-versioned web pages since the mid-nineties. However, the huge amount of data is rarely labeled with appropriate metadata and automatic approaches are required to enable semantic search. Normally, the textual content of the Internet Archive is used to extract entities and their possible relations across domains such as politics and entertainment, whereas image and video content is usually neglected. In this paper, we introduce a system for person recognition in image content of web news stored in the Internet Archive. Thus, the system complements entity recognition in text and allows researchers and analysts to track media coverage and relations of persons more precisely. Based on a deep learning face recognition approach, we suggest a system that automatically detects persons of interest and gathers sample material, which is subsequently used to identify them in the image data of the Internet Archive. We evaluate the performance of the face recognition system on an appropriate standard benchmark dataset and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach with two use cases. 
### 655.Quantizing deep convolutional networks for efficient inference: A  whitepaper [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08342.pdf)
> We present an overview of techniques for quantizing convolutional neural networks for inference with integer weights and activations. Per-channel quantization of weights and per-layer quantization of activations to 8-bits of precision post-training produces classification accuracies within 2% of floating point networks for a wide variety of CNN architectures. Model sizes can be reduced by a factor of 4 by quantizing weights to 8-bits, even when 8-bit arithmetic is not supported. This can be achieved with simple, post training quantization of weights.We benchmark latencies of quantized networks on CPUs and DSPs and observe a speedup of 2x-3x for quantized implementations compared to floating point on CPUs. Speedups of up to 10x are observed on specialized processors with fixed point SIMD capabilities, like the Qualcomm QDSPs with HVX. <br />Quantization-aware training can provide further improvements, reducing the gap to floating point to 1% at 8-bit precision. Quantization-aware training also allows for reducing the precision of weights to four bits with accuracy losses ranging from 2% to 10%, with higher accuracy drop for smaller networks.We introduce tools in TensorFlow and TensorFlowLite for quantizing convolutional networks and review best practices for quantization-aware training to obtain high accuracy with quantized weights and activations. We recommend that per-channel quantization of weights and per-layer quantization of activations be the preferred quantization scheme for hardware acceleration and kernel optimization. We also propose that future processors and hardware accelerators for optimized inference support precisions of 4, 8 and 16 bits. 
### 656.End-to-End Audio Visual Scene-Aware Dialog using Multimodal  Attention-Based Video Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08409.pdf)
> Dialog systems need to understand dynamic visual scenes in order to have conversations with users about the objects and events around them. Scene-aware dialog systems for real-world applications could be developed by integrating state-of-the-art technologies from multiple research areas, including: end-to-end dialog technologies, which generate system responses using models trained from dialog data; visual question answering (VQA) technologies, which answer questions about images using learned image features; and video description technologies, in which descriptions/captions are generated from videos using multimodal information. We introduce a new dataset of dialogs about videos of human behaviors. Each dialog is a typed conversation that consists of a sequence of 10 question-and-answer(QA) pairs between two Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers. In total, we collected dialogs on roughly 9,000 videos. Using this new dataset for Audio Visual Scene-aware dialog (AVSD), we trained an end-to-end conversation model that generates responses in a dialog about a video. Our experiments demonstrate that using multimodal features that were developed for multimodal attention-based video description enhances the quality of generated dialog about dynamic scenes (videos). Our dataset, model code and pretrained models will be publicly available for a new Video Scene-Aware Dialog challenge. 
### 657.Shape-from-Mask: A Deep Learning Based Human Body Shape Reconstruction  from Binary Mask Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08485.pdf)
> 3D content creation is referred to as one of the most fundamental tasks of computer graphics. And many 3D modeling algorithms from 2D images or curves have been developed over the past several decades. Designers are allowed to align some conceptual images or sketch some suggestive curves, from front, side, and top views, and then use them as references in constructing a 3D model automatically or manually. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated on 3D human body reconstruction in a similar manner. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based reconstruction of 3D human body shape from 2D orthographic views. A novel CNN-based regression network, with two branches corresponding to frontal and lateral views respectively, is designed for estimating 3D human body shape from 2D mask images. We train our networks separately to decouple the feature descriptors which encode the body parameters from different views, and fuse them to estimate an accurate human body shape. In addition, to overcome the shortage of training data required for this purpose, we propose some significantly data augmentation schemes for 3D human body shapes, which can be used to promote further research on this topic. Extensive experimen- tal results demonstrate that visually realistic and accurate reconstructions can be achieved effectively using our algorithm. Requiring only binary mask images, our method can help users create their own digital avatars quickly, and also make it easy to create digital human body for 3D game, virtual reality, online fashion shopping. 
### 658.Continuous Learning in Single-Incremental-Task Scenarios [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08568.pdf)
> It was recently shown that architectural, regularization and rehearsal strategies can be used to train deep models sequentially on a number of disjoint tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, these strategies are still unsatisfactory if the tasks are not disjoint but constitute a single incremental task (e.g., class-incremental learning). In this paper we point out the differences between multi-task and single-incremental-task scenarios and show that well-known approaches such as LWF, EWC and SI are not ideal for incremental task scenarios. A new approach, denoted as AR1, combining architectural and regularization strategies is then specifically proposed. AR1 overhead (in term of memory and computation) is very small thus making it suitable for online learning. When tested on CORe50 and iCIFAR-100, AR1 outperformed existing regularization strategies by a good margin. 
### 659.Dense Object Nets: Learning Dense Visual Object Descriptors By and For  Robotic Manipulation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08756.pdf)
> What is the right object representation for manipulation? We would like robots to visually perceive scenes and learn an understanding of the objects in them that (i) is task-agnostic and can be used as a building block for a variety of manipulation tasks, (ii) is generally applicable to both rigid and non-rigid objects, (iii) takes advantage of the strong priors provided by 3D vision, and (iv) is entirely learned from self-supervision. This is hard to achieve with previous methods: much recent work in grasping does not extend to grasping specific objects or other tasks, whereas task-specific learning may require many trials to generalize well across object configurations or other tasks. In this paper we present Dense Object Nets, which build on recent developments in self-supervised dense descriptor learning, as a consistent object representation for visual understanding and manipulation. We demonstrate they can be trained quickly (approximately 20 minutes) for a wide variety of previously unseen and potentially non-rigid objects. We additionally present novel contributions to enable multi-object descriptor learning, and show that by modifying our training procedure, we can either acquire descriptors which generalize across classes of objects, or descriptors that are distinct for each object instance. Finally, we demonstrate the novel application of learned dense descriptors to robotic manipulation. We demonstrate grasping of specific points on an object across potentially deformed object configurations, and demonstrate using class general descriptors to transfer specific grasps across objects in a class. 
### 660.DARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09055.pdf)
> This paper addresses the scalability challenge of architecture search by formulating the task in a differentiable manner. Unlike conventional approaches of applying evolution or reinforcement learning over a discrete and non-differentiable search space, our method is based on the continuous relaxation of the architecture representation, allowing efficient search of the architecture using gradient descent. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 show that our algorithm excels in discovering high-performance convolutional architectures for image classification and recurrent architectures for language modeling, while being orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art non-differentiable techniques. 
### 661.Deep $k$-Means: Re-Training and Parameter Sharing with Harder Cluster  Assignments for Compressing Deep Convolutions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09228.pdf)
> The current trend of pushing CNNs deeper with convolutions has created a pressing demand to achieve higher compression gains on CNNs where convolutions dominate the computation and parameter amount (e.g., GoogLeNet, ResNet and Wide ResNet). Further, the high energy consumption of convolutions limits its deployment on mobile devices. To this end, we proposed a simple yet effective scheme for compressing convolutions though applying k-means clustering on the weights, compression is achieved through weight-sharing, by only recording $K$ cluster centers and weight assignment indexes. We then introduced a novel spectrally relaxed $k$-means regularization, which tends to make hard assignments of convolutional layer weights to $K$ learned cluster centers during re-training. We additionally propose an improved set of metrics to estimate energy consumption of CNN hardware implementations, whose estimation results are verified to be consistent with previously proposed energy estimation tool extrapolated from actual hardware measurements. We finally evaluated Deep $k$-Means across several CNN models in terms of both compression ratio and energy consumption reduction, observing promising results without incurring accuracy loss. The code is available at <a href="https://github.com/Sandbox3aster/Deep-K-Means">this https URL</a> 
### 662.Track Xplorer: A System for Visual Analysis of Sensor-based Motor  Activity Predictions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09256.pdf)
> With the rapid commoditization of wearable sensors, detecting human movements from sensor datasets has become increasingly common over a wide range of applications. To detect activities, data scientists iteratively experiment with different classifiers before deciding which model to deploy. Effective reasoning about and comparison of alternative classifiers are crucial in successful model development. This is, however, inherently difficult in developing classifiers for sensor data, where the intricacy of long temporal sequences, high prediction frequency, and imprecise labeling make standard evaluation methods relatively ineffective and even misleading. We introduce Track Xplorer, an interactive visualization system to query, analyze, and compare the predictions of sensor-data classifiers. Track Xplorer enables users to interactively explore and compare the results of different classifiers, and assess their accuracy with respect to the ground-truth labels and video. Through integration with a version control system, Track Xplorer supports tracking of models and their parameters without additional workload on model developers. Track Xplorer also contributes an extensible algebra over track representations to filter, compose, and compare classification outputs, enabling users to reason effectively about classifier performance. We apply Track Xplorer in a collaborative project to develop classifiers to detect movements from multisensor data gathered from Parkinson's disease patients. We demonstrate how Track Xplorer helps identify early on possible systemic data errors, effectively track and compare the results of different classifiers, and reason about and pinpoint the causes of misclassifications. 
### 663.Learning Task-Oriented Grasping for Tool Manipulation from Simulated  Self-Supervision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09266.pdf)
> Tool manipulation is vital for facilitating robots to complete challenging task goals. It requires reasoning about the desired effect of the task and thus properly grasping and manipulating the tool to achieve the task. Task-agnostic grasping optimizes for grasp robustness while ignoring crucial task-specific constraints. In this paper, we propose the Task-Oriented Grasping Network (TOG-Net) to jointly optimize both task-oriented grasping of a tool and the manipulation policy for that tool. The training process of the model is based on large-scale simulated self-supervision with procedurally generated tool objects. We perform both simulated and real-world experiments on two tool-based manipulation tasks: sweeping and hammering. Our model achieves overall 71.1% task success rate for sweeping and 80.0% task success rate for hammering. Supplementary material is available at: bit.ly/task-oriented-grasp 
### 664.Context-Aware Pedestrian Motion Prediction In Urban Intersections [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09453.pdf)
> This paper presents a novel context-based approach for pedestrian motion prediction in crowded, urban intersections, with the additional flexibility of prediction in similar, but new, environments. Previously, Chen et. al. combined Markovian-based and clustering-based approaches to learn motion primitives in a grid-based world and subsequently predict pedestrian trajectories by modeling the transition between learned primitives as a Gaussian Process (GP). This work extends that prior approach by incorporating semantic features from the environment (relative distance to curbside and status of pedestrian traffic lights) in the GP formulation for more accurate predictions of pedestrian trajectories over the same timescale. We evaluate the new approach on real-world data collected using one of the vehicles in the MIT Mobility On Demand fleet. The results show 12.5% improvement in prediction accuracy and a 2.65 times reduction in Area Under the Curve (AUC), which is used as a metric to quantify the span of predicted set of trajectories, such that a lower AUC corresponds to a higher level of confidence in the future direction of pedestrian motion. 
### 665.Unsupervised Learning of Sensorimotor Affordances by Stochastic Future  Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09655.pdf)
> Recently, much progress has been made building systems that can capture static image properties, but natural environments are intrinsically dynamic. For an intelligent agent, perception is responsible not only for capturing features of scene content, but also capturing its \textit{affordances}: how the state of things can change, especially as the result of the agent's actions. We propose an unsupervised method to learn representations of the sensorimotor affordances of an environment. We do so by learning an embedding for stochastic future prediction that is (i) sensitive to scene dynamics and minimally sensitive to static scene content and (ii) compositional in nature, capturing the fact that changes in the environment can be composed to produce a cumulative change. We show that these two properties are sufficient to induce representations that are reusable across visually distinct scenes that share degrees of freedom. We show the applicability of our method to synthetic settings and its potential for understanding more complex, realistic visual settings. 
### 666.Deep Generative Models with Learnable Knowledge Constraints [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09764.pdf)
> The broad set of deep generative models (DGMs) has achieved remarkable advances. However, it is often difficult to incorporate rich structured domain knowledge with the end-to-end DGMs. Posterior regularization (PR) offers a principled framework to impose structured constraints on probabilistic models, but has limited applicability to the diverse DGMs that can lack a Bayesian formulation or even explicit density evaluation. PR also requires constraints to be fully specified {\it a priori}, which is impractical or suboptimal for complex knowledge with learnable uncertain parts. In this paper, we establish mathematical correspondence between PR and reinforcement learning (RL), and, based on the connection, expand PR to learn constraints as the extrinsic reward in RL. The resulting algorithm is model-agnostic to apply to any DGMs, and is flexible to adapt arbitrary constraints with the model jointly. Experiments on human image generation and templated sentence generation show models with learned knowledge constraints by our algorithm greatly improve over base generative models. 
### 667.Unsupervised Learning by Competing Hidden Units [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10181.pdf)
> It is widely believed that the backpropagation algorithm is essential for learning good feature detectors in early layers of artificial neural networks, so that these detectors are useful for the task performed by the higher layers of that neural network. At the same time, the traditional form of backpropagation is biologically implausible. In the present paper we propose an unusual learning rule, which has a degree of biological plausibility, and which is motivated by Hebb's idea that change of the synapse strength should be local - i.e. should depend only on the activities of the pre and post synaptic neurons. We design a learning algorithm that utilizes global inhibition in the hidden layer, and is capable of learning early feature detectors in a completely unsupervised way. These learned lower layer feature detectors can be used to train higher layer weights in a usual supervised way so that the performance of the full network is comparable to the performance of standard feedforward networks trained end-to-end with a backpropagation algorithm. 
### 668.Deep Feature Factorization For Concept Discovery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10206.pdf)
> We propose Deep Feature Factorization (DFF), a method capable of localizing similar semantic concepts within an image or a set of images. We use DFF to gain insight into a deep convolutional neural network's learned features, where we detect hierarchical cluster structures in feature space. This is visualized as heat maps, which highlight semantically matching regions across a set of images, revealing what the network `perceives' as similar. DFF can also be used to perform co-segmentation and co-localization, and we report state-of-the-art results on these tasks. 
### 669.QT-Opt: Scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Robotic  Manipulation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10293.pdf)
> In this paper, we study the problem of learning vision-based dynamic manipulation skills using a scalable reinforcement learning approach. We study this problem in the context of grasping, a longstanding challenge in robotic manipulation. In contrast to static learning behaviors that choose a grasp point and then execute the desired grasp, our method enables closed-loop vision-based control, whereby the robot continuously updates its grasp strategy based on the most recent observations to optimize long-horizon grasp success. To that end, we introduce QT-Opt, a scalable self-supervised vision-based reinforcement learning framework that can leverage over 580k real-world grasp attempts to train a deep neural network Q-function with over 1.2M parameters to perform closed-loop, real-world grasping that generalizes to 96% grasp success on unseen objects. Aside from attaining a very high success rate, our method exhibits behaviors that are quite distinct from more standard grasping systems: using only RGB vision-based perception from an over-the-shoulder camera, our method automatically learns regrasping strategies, probes objects to find the most effective grasps, learns to reposition objects and perform other non-prehensile pre-grasp manipulations, and responds dynamically to disturbances and perturbations. 
### 670.Learning Visually-Grounded Semantics from Contrastive Adversarial  Samples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10348.pdf)
> We study the problem of grounding distributional representations of texts on the visual domain, namely visual-semantic embeddings (VSE for short). Begin with an insightful adversarial attack on VSE embeddings, we show the limitation of current frameworks and image-text datasets (e.g., MS-COCO) both quantitatively and qualitatively. The large gap between the number of possible constitutions of real-world semantics and the size of parallel data, to a large extent, restricts the model to establish the link between textual semantics and visual concepts. We alleviate this problem by augmenting the MS-COCO image captioning datasets with textual contrastive adversarial samples. These samples are synthesized using linguistic rules and the WordNet knowledge base. The construction procedure is both syntax- and semantics-aware. The samples enforce the model to ground learned embeddings to concrete concepts within the image. This simple but powerful technique brings a noticeable improvement over the baselines on a diverse set of downstream tasks, in addition to defending known-type adversarial attacks. We release the codes at <a href="https://github.com/ExplorerFreda/VSE-C.">this https URL</a> 
### 671.Physics-based Scene-level Reasoning for Object Pose Estimation in  Clutter [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10457.pdf)
> This paper focuses on vision-based pose estimation for multiple rigid objects placed in clutter, especially in cases involving occlusions and objects resting on each other. Progress has been achieved recently in object recognition given advancements in deep learning. Nevertheless, such tools typically require a large amount of training data and significant manual effort to label objects. This limits their applicability in robotics, where solutions must scale to a large number of objects and variety of conditions. Moreover, the combinatorial nature of the scenes that could arise from the placement of multiple objects is hard to capture in the training dataset. Thus, the learned models might not produce the desired level of precision required for tasks, such as robotic manipulation. This work proposes an autonomous process for pose estimation that spans from data generation to scene-level reasoning and lifelong self-learning. In particular, the proposed framework first generates a labeled dataset for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection in clutter. These detections are used to guide a scene-level optimization process, which considers the interactions between the different objects present in the clutter to output pose estimates of high precision. Furthermore, confident estimates are used to label online real images from multiple views and re-train the process in a lifelong self-learning pipeline. Experimental results indicate that this process is quickly able to identify in cluttered scenes physically-consistent object poses that are more precise than the ones found by reasoning over individual instances of objects. Furthermore, the quality of pose estimates increases over time given the self-learning process. 
### 672.This looks like that: deep learning for interpretable image recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10574.pdf)
> When we are faced with challenging image classification tasks, we often explain our reasoning by dissecting the image, and pointing out prototypical aspects of one class or another. The mounting evidence for each of the classes helps us make our final decision. In this work, we introduce a deep network architecture that reasons in a similar way: the network dissects the image by finding prototypical parts, and combines evidence from the prototypes to make a final classification. The algorithm thus reasons in a way that is qualitatively similar to the way ornithologists, physicians, geologists, architects, and others would explain to people on how to solve challenging image classification tasks. The network uses only image-level labels for training, meaning that there are no labels for parts of images. We demonstrate the method on the CIFAR-10 dataset and 10 classes from the CUB-200-2011 dataset. 
### 673.Adversarial Reprogramming of Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11146.pdf)
> Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In computer vision, well-crafted perturbations to images can cause neural networks to make mistakes such as identifying a panda as a gibbon or confusing a cat with a computer. Previous adversarial examples have been designed to degrade performance of models or cause machine learning models to produce specific outputs chosen ahead of time by the attacker. We introduce adversarial attacks that instead reprogram the target model to perform a task chosen by the attacker---without the attacker needing to specify or compute the desired output for each test-time input. This attack is accomplished by optimizing for a single adversarial perturbation, of unrestricted magnitude, that can be added to all test-time inputs to a machine learning model in order to cause the model to perform a task chosen by the adversary when processing these inputs---even if the model was not trained to do this task. These perturbations can be thus considered a program for the new task. We demonstrate adversarial reprogramming on six ImageNet classification models, repurposing these models to perform a counting task, as well as two classification tasks: classification of MNIST and CIFAR-10 examples presented within the input to the ImageNet model. 
### 674.A Multimodal Recommender System for Large-scale Assortment Generation in  E-commerce [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11226.pdf)
> E-commerce platforms surface interesting products largely through product recommendations that capture users' styles and aesthetic preferences. Curating recommendations as a complete complementary set, or assortment, is critical for a successful e-commerce experience, especially for product categories such as furniture, where items are selected together with the overall theme, style or ambiance of a space in mind. In this paper, we propose two visually-aware recommender systems that can automatically curate an assortment of living room furniture around a couple of pre-selected seed pieces for the room. The first system aims to maximize the visual-based style compatibility of the entire selection by making use of transfer learning and topic modeling. The second system extends the first by incorporating text data and applying polylingual topic modeling to infer style over both modalities. We review the production pipeline for surfacing these visually-aware recommender systems and compare them through offline validations and large-scale online A/B tests on Overstock. Our experimental results show that complimentary style is best discovered over product sets when both visual and textual data are incorporated. 
### 675.Guaranteed Deterministic Bounds on the Total Variation Distance between  Univariate Mixtures [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11311.pdf)
> The total variation distance is a core statistical distance between probability measures that satisfies the metric axioms, with value always falling in $[0,1]$. This distance plays a fundamental role in machine learning and signal processing: It is a member of the broader class of $f$-divergences, and it is related to the probability of error in Bayesian hypothesis testing. Since the total variation distance does not admit closed-form expressions for statistical mixtures (like Gaussian mixture models), one often has to rely in practice on costly numerical integrations or on fast Monte Carlo approximations that however do not guarantee deterministic lower and upper bounds. In this work, we consider two methods for bounding the total variation of univariate mixture models: The first method is based on the information monotonicity property of the total variation to design guaranteed nested deterministic lower bounds. The second method relies on computing the geometric lower and upper envelopes of weighted mixture components to derive deterministic bounds based on density ratio. We demonstrate the tightness of our bounds in a series of experiments on Gaussian, Gamma and Rayleigh mixture models. 
### 676.Optimal Clustering under Uncertainty [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00672.pdf)
> Classical clustering algorithms typically either lack an underlying probability framework to make them predictive or focus on parameter estimation rather than defining and minimizing a notion of error. Recent work addresses these issues by developing a probabilistic framework based on the theory of random labeled point processes and characterizing a Bayes clusterer that minimizes the number of misclustered points. The Bayes clusterer is analogous to the Bayes classifier. Whereas determining a Bayes classifier requires full knowledge of the feature-label distribution, deriving a Bayes clusterer requires full knowledge of the point process. When uncertain of the point process, one would like to find a robust clusterer that is optimal over the uncertainty, just as one may find optimal robust classifiers with uncertain feature-label distributions. Herein, we derive an optimal robust clusterer by first finding an effective random point process that incorporates all randomness within its own probabilistic structure and from which a Bayes clusterer can be derived that provides an optimal robust clusterer relative to the uncertainty. This is analogous to the use of effective class-conditional distributions in robust classification. After evaluating the performance of robust clusterers in synthetic mixtures of Gaussians models, we apply the framework to granular imaging, where we make use of the asymptotic granulometric moment theory for granular images to relate robust clustering theory to the application. 
### 677.Data-Free/Data-Sparse Softmax Parameter Estimation with Structured Class  Geometries [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00728.pdf)
> This note considers softmax parameter estimation when little/no labeled training data is available, but a priori information about the relative geometry of class label log-odds boundaries is available. It is shown that `data-free' softmax model synthesis corresponds to solving a linear system of parameter equations, wherein desired dominant class log-odds boundaries are encoded via convex polytopes that decompose the input feature space. When solvable, the linear equations yield closed-form softmax parameter solution families using class boundary polytope specifications only. This allows softmax parameter learning to be implemented without expensive brute force data sampling and numerical optimization. The linear equations can also be adapted to constrained maximum likelihood estimation in data-sparse settings. Since solutions may also fail to exist for the linear parameter equations derived from certain polytope specifications, it is thus also shown that there exist probabilistic classification problems over m convexly separable classes for which the log-odds boundaries cannot be learned using an m-class softmax model. 
### 678.Infrared Safety of a Neural-Net Top Tagging Algorithm [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01263.pdf)
> Neural network-based algorithms provide a promising approach to jet classification problems, such as boosted top jet tagging. To date, NN-based top taggers demonstrated excellent performance in Monte Carlo studies. In this paper, we construct a top-jet tagger based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and apply it to parton-level boosted top samples, with and without an additional gluon in the final state. We show that the jet observable defined by the CNN obeys the canonical definition of infrared safety: it is unaffected by the presence of the extra gluon, as long as it is soft or collinear with one of the quarks. Our results indicate that the CNN tagger is robust with respect to possible mis-modeling of soft and collinear final-state radiation by Monte Carlo generators. 
### 679.Design of optimal illumination patterns in single-pixel imaging using  image dictionaries [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01340.pdf)
> Single-pixel imaging (SPI) has a major drawback that the huge number of sequential illuminations for capturing one single image requires long acquisition time and high cost. Basis illumination patterns such as sinusoidal patterns in Fourier transform and Hadamard patterns are employed to enhance the imaging efficiency. The basis illumination patterns can achieve much better efficiency than random intensity illumination patterns but the performance is still sub-optimal since the basis patterns are fixed and non-adaptive for varying object images. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to design the illumination patterns adaptively when SPI is applied in a specific and pre-known imaging scenario. Exemplar training images belonging to the target specific category of object images are collected and an image dictionary is constructed in advance. Then the optimized illumination patterns are designed by extracting the common image features from the image dictionary using principal component analysis. Simulation results reveal that our proposed scheme outperforms conventional Fourier single-pixel imaging in terms of imaging efficiency. 
### 680.Deep Image Compression via End-to-End Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01496.pdf)
> We present a lossy image compression method based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which outperforms the existing BPG, WebP, JPEG2000 and JPEG as measured via multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM), at the same bit rate. Currently, most of the CNNs based approaches train the network using a L2 loss between the reconstructions and the ground-truths in the pixel domain, which leads to over-smoothing results and visual quality degradation especially at a very low bit rate. Therefore, we improve the subjective quality with the combination of a perception loss and an adversarial loss additionally. To achieve better rate-distortion optimization (RDO), we also introduce an easy-to-hard transfer learning when adding quantization error and rate constraint. Finally, we evaluate our method on public Kodak and the Test Dataset P/M released by the Computer Vision Lab of ETH Zurich, resulting in averaged 7.81% and 19.1% BD-rate reduction over BPG, respectively. 
### 681.Integrating Flexible Normalization into Mid-Level Representations of  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01823.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are becoming increasingly popular models to predict neural responses in visual cortex. However, contextual effects, which are prevalent in neural processing and in perception, are not explicitly handled by current CNNs, including those used for neural prediction. In primary visual cortex, neural responses are modulated by stimuli spatially surrounding the classical receptive field in rich ways. These effects have been modeled with divisive normalization approaches, including flexible models where spatial normalization is recruited only to the degree responses from center and surround locations are deemed statistically dependent. We propose a flexible normalization model applied to mid-level representations of deep CNNs as a tractable way to study contextual normalization mechanisms in mid-level visual areas. This approach captures non-trivial spatial dependencies among mid-level features in CNNs, such as those present in textures and other visual stimuli that arise from tiling high order features, geometrically. We expect that the proposed approach can make predictions about when spatial normalization might be recruited in mid-level cortical areas. We also expect this approach to be useful as part of the CNN toolkit, therefore going beyond more restrictive fixed forms of normalization. 
### 682.Correspondence of Deep Neural Networks and the Brain for Visual Textures [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02888.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on objects and scenes have shown intriguing ability to predict some response properties of visual cortical neurons. However, the factors and computations that give rise to such ability, and the role of intermediate processing stages in explaining changes that develop across areas of the cortical hierarchy, are poorly understood. We focused on the sensitivity to textures as a paradigmatic example, since recent neurophysiology experiments provide rich data pointing to texture sensitivity in secondary but not primary visual cortex. We developed a quantitative approach for selecting a subset of the neural unit population from the CNN that best describes the brain neural recordings. We found that the first two layers of the CNN showed qualitative and quantitative correspondence to the cortical data across a number of metrics. This compatibility was reduced for the architecture alone rather than the learned weights, for some other related hierarchical models, and only mildly in the absence of a nonlinear computation akin to local divisive normalization. Our results show that the CNN class of model is effective for capturing changes that develop across early areas of cortex, and has the potential to facilitate understanding of the computations that give rise to hierarchical processing in the brain. 
### 683.Learn from Your Neighbor: Learning Multi-modal Mappings from Sparse  Annotations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02934.pdf)
> Many structured prediction problems (particularly in vision and language domains) are ambiguous, with multiple outputs being correct for an input - e.g. there are many ways of describing an image, multiple ways of translating a sentence; however, exhaustively annotating the applicability of all possible outputs is intractable due to exponentially large output spaces (e.g. all English sentences). In practice, these problems are cast as multi-class prediction, with the likelihood of only a sparse set of annotations being maximized - unfortunately penalizing for placing beliefs on plausible but unannotated outputs. We make and test the following hypothesis - for a given input, the annotations of its neighbors may serve as an additional supervisory signal. Specifically, we propose an objective that transfers supervision from neighboring examples. We first study the properties of our developed method in a controlled toy setup before reporting results on multi-label classification and two image-grounded sequence modeling tasks - captioning and question generation. We evaluate using standard task-specific metrics and measures of output diversity, finding consistent improvements over standard maximum likelihood training and other baselines. 
### 684.Efficient Optimization Algorithms for Robust Principal Component  Analysis and Its Variants [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03430.pdf)
> Robust PCA has drawn significant attention in the last decade due to its success in numerous application domains, ranging from bio-informatics, statistics, and machine learning to image and video processing in computer vision. Robust PCA and its variants such as sparse PCA and stable PCA can be formulated as optimization problems with exploitable special structures. Many specialized efficient optimization methods have been proposed to solve robust PCA and related problems. In this paper we review existing optimization methods for solving convex and nonconvex relaxations/variants of robust PCA, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and elaborate on their convergence behaviors. We also provide some insights for possible future research directions including new algorithmic frameworks that might be suitable for implementing on multi-processor setting to handle large-scale problems. 
### 685.Generalized Earley Parser: Bridging Symbolic Grammars and Sequence Data  for Future Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03497.pdf)
> Future predictions on sequence data (e.g., videos or audios) require the algorithms to capture non-Markovian and compositional properties of high-level semantics. Context-free grammars are natural choices to capture such properties, but traditional grammar parsers (e.g., Earley parser) only take symbolic sentences as inputs. In this paper, we generalize the Earley parser to parse sequence data which is neither segmented nor labeled. This generalized Earley parser integrates a grammar parser with a classifier to find the optimal segmentation and labels, and makes top-down future predictions. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other approaches for future human activity prediction. 
### 686.Stochastic seismic waveform inversion using generative adversarial  networks as a geological prior [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03720.pdf)
> We present an application of deep generative models in the context of partial-differential equation (PDE) constrained inverse problems. We combine a generative adversarial network (GAN) representing an a priori model that creates subsurface geological structures and their petrophysical properties, with the numerical solution of the PDE governing the propagation of acoustic waves within the earth's interior. We perform Bayesian inversion using an approximate Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) to sample from the posterior given seismic observations. Gradients with respect to the model parameters governing the forward problem are obtained by solving the adjoint of the acoustic wave equation. Gradients of the mismatch with respect to the latent variables are obtained by leveraging the differentiable nature of the deep neural network used to represent the generative model. We show that approximate MALA sampling allows efficient Bayesian inversion of model parameters obtained from a prior represented by a deep generative model, obtaining a diverse set of realizations that reflect the observed seismic response. 
### 687.Compression of phase-only holograms with JPEG standard and deep learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03811.pdf)
> It is a critical issue to reduce the enormous amount of data in the processing, storage and transmission of a hologram in digital format. In photograph compression, the JPEG standard is commonly supported by almost every system and device. It will be favorable if JPEG standard is applicable to hologram compression, with advantages of universal compatibility. However, the reconstructed image from a JPEG compressed hologram suffers from severe quality degradation since some high frequency features in the hologram will be lost during the compression process. In this work, we employ a deep convolutional neural network to reduce the artifacts in a JPEG compressed hologram. Simulation and experimental results reveal that our proposed "JPEG + deep learning" hologram compression scheme can achieve satisfactory reconstruction results for a computer-generated phase-only hologram after compression. 
### 688.Endoscopic navigation in the absence of CT imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03997.pdf)
> Clinical examinations that involve endoscopic exploration of the nasal cavity and sinuses often do not have a reference image to provide structural context to the clinician. In this paper, we present a system for navigation during clinical endoscopic exploration in the absence of computed tomography (CT) scans by making use of shape statistics from past CT scans. Using a deformable registration algorithm along with dense reconstructions from video, we show that we are able to achieve submillimeter registrations in in-vivo clinical data and are able to assign confidence to these registrations using confidence criteria established using simulated data. 
### 689.The Research of the Real-time Detection and Recognition of Targets in  Streetscape Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04070.pdf)
> This study proposes a method for the real-time detection and recognition of targets in streetscape videos. The proposed method is based on separation confidence computation and scale synthesis optimization. We use the proposed method to detect and recognize targets in streetscape videos with high frame rates and high definition. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that the accuracy and robustness of our proposed method are superior to those of conventional methods. 
### 690.Initialize globally before acting locally: Enabling Landmark-free 3D US  to MRI Registration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04368.pdf)
> Registration of partial-view 3D US volumes with MRI data is influenced by initialization. The standard of practice is using extrinsic or intrinsic landmarks, which can be very tedious to obtain. To overcome the limitations of registration initialization, we present a novel approach that is based on Euclidean distance maps derived from easily obtainable coarse segmentations. We evaluate our approach quantitatively on the publicly available RESECT dataset and show that it is robust regarding overlap of target area and initial position. Furthermore, our method provides initializations that are suitable for state-of-the-art nonlinear, deformable image registration algorithm's capture ranges. 
### 691.Fast Rotational Sparse Coding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04374.pdf)
> We propose an algorithm for rotational sparse coding along with an efficient implementation using steerability. Sparse coding (also called \emph{dictionary learning}) is an important technique in image processing, useful in inverse problems, compression, and analysis; however, the usual formulation fails to capture an important aspect of the structure of images: images are formed from building blocks, e.g., edges, lines, or points, that appear at different locations, orientations, and scales. The sparse coding problem can be reformulated to explicitly account for these transforms, at the cost of increased computational cost. In this work, we propose an algorithm for a rotational version of sparse coding that is based on K-SVD with additional rotation operations. We then propose a method to accelerate these rotations by learning the dictionary in a steerable basis. We compare the proposed approach to standard sparse with experiments on patch coding and texture classification; in the latter case we report state-of-the-art results on the Outex_TC_00010 dataset. 
### 692.The Unusual Effectiveness of Averaging in GAN Training [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04498.pdf)
> We show empirically that the optimal strategy of parameter averaging in a minmax convex-concave game setting is also strikingly effective in the non convex-concave GAN setting, specifically alleviating the convergence issues associated with cycling behavior observed in GANs. We show that averaging over generator parameters outside of the trainig loop consistently improves inception and FID scores on different architectures and for different GAN objectives. We provide comprehensive experimental results across a range of datasets, bilinear games, mixture of Gaussians, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA and ImageNet, to demonstrate its effectiveness. We achieve state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and produce clean CelebA face images, demonstrating that averaging is one of the most effective techniques for training highly performant GANs. 
### 693.An Extension of Averaged-Operator-Based Algorithms [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04561.pdf)
> Many of the algorithms used to solve minimization problems with sparsity-inducing regularizers are generic in the sense that they do not take into account the sparsity of the solution in any particular way. However, algorithms known as semismooth Newton are able to take advantage of this sparsity to accelerate their convergence. We show how to extend these algorithms in different directions, and study the convergence of the resulting algorithms by showing that they are a particular case of an extension of the well-known Krasnosel'ski\u{\i}--Mann scheme. 
### 694.Smart Novel Computer-based Analytical Tool for Image Forgery  Authentication [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04576.pdf)
> This paper presents an integration of image forgery detection with image facial recognition using black propagation neural network (BPNN). We observed that facial image recognition by itself will always give a matching output or closest possible output image for every input image irrespective of the authenticity or otherwise not of the testing input image. Based on this, we are proposing the combination of the blind but powerful automation image forgery detection for entire input images for the BPNN recognition program. Hence, an input image must first be authenticated before being fed into the recognition program. Thus, an image security identification and authentication requirement, any image that fails the authentication/verification stage are not to be used as an input/test image. In addition, the universal smart GUI tool is proposed and designed to perform image forgery detection with the high accuracy of 2% error rate. 
### 695.Clinical Parameters Prediction for Gait Disorder Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04627.pdf)
> Being able to predict clinical parameters in order to diagnose gait disorders in a patient is of great value in planning treatments. It is known that \textit{decision parameters} such as cadence, step length, and walking speed are critical in the diagnosis of gait disorders in patients. This project aims to predict the decision parameters using two ways and afterwards giving advice on whether a patient needs treatment or not. In one way, we use clinically measured parameters such as Ankle Dorsiflexion, age, walking speed, step length, stride length, weight over height squared (BMI) and etc. to predict the decision parameters. In a second way, we use videos recorded from patient's walking tests in a clinic in order to extract the coordinates of the joints of the patient over time and predict the decision parameters. Finally, having the decision parameters we pre-classify gait disorder intensity of a patient and as the result make decisions on whether a patient needs treatment or not. 
### 696.A Connectome Based Hexagonal Lattice Convolutional Network Model of the  Drosophila Visual System [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04793.pdf)
> What can we learn from a connectome? We constructed a simplified model of the first two stages of the fly visual system, the lamina and medulla. The resulting hexagonal lattice convolutional network was trained using backpropagation through time to perform object tracking in natural scene videos. Networks initialized with weights from connectome reconstructions automatically discovered well-known orientation and direction selectivity properties in T4 neurons and their inputs, while networks initialized at random did not. Our work is the first demonstration, that knowledge of the connectome can enable in silico predictions of the functional properties of individual neurons in a circuit, leading to an understanding of circuit function from structure alone. 
### 697.fMRI Semantic Category Decoding using Linguistic Encoding of Word  Embeddings [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05177.pdf)
> The dispute of how the human brain represents conceptual knowledge has been argued in many scientific fields. Brain imaging studies have shown that the spatial patterns of neural activation in the brain are correlated with thinking about different semantic categories of words (for example, tools, animals, and buildings) or when viewing the related pictures. In this paper, we present a computational model that learns to predict the neural activation captured in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of test words. Unlike the models with hand-crafted features that have been used in the literature, in this paper we propose a novel approach wherein decoding models are built with features extracted from popular linguistic encodings of Word2Vec, GloVe, Meta-Embeddings in conjunction with the empirical fMRI data associated with viewing several dozen concrete nouns. We compared these models with several other models that use word features extracted from FastText, Randomly-generated features, Mitchell's 25 features [1]. The experimental results show that the predicted fMRI images using Meta-Embeddings meet the state-of-the-art performance. Although models with features from GloVe and Word2Vec predict fMRI images similar to the state-of-the-art model, model with features from Meta-Embeddings predicts significantly better. The proposed scheme that uses popular linguistic encoding offers a simple and easy approach for semantic decoding from fMRI experiments. 
### 698.Benchmarks for Image Classification and Other High-dimensional Pattern  Recognition Problems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05272.pdf)
> A good classification method should yield more accurate results than simple heuristics. But there are classification problems, especially high-dimensional ones like the ones based on image/video data, for which simple heuristics can work quite accurately; the structure of the data in such problems is easy to uncover without any sophisticated or computationally expensive method. On the other hand, some problems have a structure that can only be found with sophisticated pattern recognition methods. We are interested in quantifying the difficulty of a given high-dimensional pattern recognition problem. We consider the case where the patterns come from two pre-determined classes and where the objects are represented by points in a high-dimensional vector space. However, the framework we propose is extendable to an arbitrarily large number of classes. We propose classification benchmarks based on simple random projection heuristics. Our benchmarks are 2D curves parameterized by the classification error and computational cost of these simple heuristics. Each curve divides the plane into a "positive- gain" and a "negative-gain" region. The latter contains methods that are ill-suited for the given classification problem. The former is divided into two by the curve asymptote; methods that lie in the small region under the curve but right of the asymptote merely provide a computational gain but no structural advantage over the random heuristics. We prove that the curve asymptotes are optimal (i.e. at Bayes error) in some cases, and thus no sophisticated method can provide a structural advantage over the random heuristics. Such classification problems, an example of which we present in our numerical experiments, provide poor ground for testing new pattern classification methods. 
### 699.PCAS: Pruning Channels with Attention Statistics [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05382.pdf)
> To implement deep neural networks on small embedded devices, conventional techniques use channel pruning looking considering manual compression rate per layer to reduce parameters. Besides it is difficult to consider the relationships between layers and it takes a lot of time for deeper models. For addressing these issues, we propose a new channel pruning technique based on attention that can evaluate the importance of channels. We improved the method with the criterion to allow the automatic channel selection using a single compression rate for the entire model. Experimental results showed that a parameter reduction of 90.8% and FLOPs reduction of 79.4% was achieved with an accuracy degradation of around 1% for the compressed ResNet-50 model on the CIFAR-10 benchmark. 
### 700.Selfless Sequential Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05421.pdf)
> Sequential learning studies the problem of learning tasks in a sequence with restricted access to only the data of the current task. In the setting with a fixed model capacity, the learning process should not be selfish and account for later tasks to be added and therefore aim at utilizing a minimum number of neurons, leaving enough capacity for future needs. We explore different regularization strategies and activation functions that could lead to less interference between the different tasks. We show that learning a sparse representation is more beneficial for sequential learning than encouraging parameter sparsity regardless of their corresponding neurons. We particularly propose a novel regularizer that encourages representation sparsity by means of neural inhibition. It results in few active neurons which in turn leaves more free neurons to be utilized by upcoming tasks. We combine our regularizer with state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods that penalize changes on important previously learned parts of the network. We show that increased sparsity translates in a performance improvement on the different tasks that are learned in a sequence. 
### 701.Neural Stethoscopes: Unifying Analytic, Auxiliary and Adversarial  Network Probing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05502.pdf)
> Model interpretability and systematic, targeted model adaptation present central tenets in machine learning for addressing limited or biased datasets. In this paper, we introduce neural stethoscopes as a framework for quantifying the degree of importance of specific factors of influence in deep networks as well as for actively promoting and suppressing information as appropriate. In doing so we unify concepts from multitask learning as well as training with auxiliary and adversarial losses. We showcase the efficacy of neural stethoscopes in an intuitive physics domain. Specifically, we investigate the challenge of visually predicting stability of block towers and demonstrate that the network uses visual cues which makes it susceptible to biases in the dataset. Through the use of stethoscopes we interrogate the accessibility of specific information throughout the network stack and show that we are able to actively de-bias network predictions as well as enhance performance via suitable auxiliary and adversarial stethoscope losses. 
### 702.Insights on representational similarity in neural networks with  canonical correlation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05759.pdf)
> Comparing different neural network representations and determining how representations evolve over time remain challenging open questions in our understanding of the function of neural networks. Comparing representations in neural networks is fundamentally difficult as the structure of representations varies greatly, even across groups of networks trained on identical tasks, and over the course of training. Here, we develop projection weighted CCA (Canonical Correlation Analysis) as a tool for understanding neural networks, building off of SVCCA, a recently proposed method. We first improve the core method, showing how to differentiate between signal and noise, and then apply this technique to compare across a group of CNNs, demonstrating that networks which generalize converge to more similar representations than networks which memorize, that wider networks converge to more similar solutions than narrow networks, and that trained networks with identical topology but different learning rates converge to distinct clusters with diverse representations. We also investigate the representational dynamics of RNNs, across both training and sequential timesteps, finding that RNNs converge in a bottom-up pattern over the course of training and that the hidden state is highly variable over the course of a sequence, even when accounting for linear transforms. Together, these results provide new insights into the function of CNNs and RNNs, and demonstrate the utility of using CCA to understand representations. 
### 703.Comparative survey of visual object classifiers [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06321.pdf)
> Classification of Visual Object Classes represents one of the most elaborated areas of interest in Computer Vision. It is always challenging to get one specific detector, descriptor or classifier that provides the expected object classification result. Consequently, it critical to compare the different detection, descriptor and classifier methods available and chose a single or combination of two or three to get an optimal result. In this paper, we have presented a comparative survey of different feature descriptors and classifiers. From feature descriptors, SIFT (Sparse &amp; Dense) and HeuSIFT combination colour descriptors; From classification techniques, Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbor, ADABOOST, and fisher are covered in comparative practical implementation survey. 
### 704.Tensor-Tensor Product Toolbox [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07247.pdf)
> The tensor-tensor product (t-product) [M. E. Kilmer and C. D. Martin, 2011] is a natural generalization of matrix multiplication. Based on t-product, many operations on matrix can be extended to tensor cases, including tensor SVD, tensor spectral norm, tensor nuclear norm [C. Lu, et al., 2018] and many others. The linear algebraic structure of tensors are similar to the matrix cases. We develop a Matlab toolbox to implement several basic operations on tensors based on t-product. The toolbox is available at <a href="https://github.com/canyilu/tproduct.">this https URL</a>

> In this paper, we try to analyze drowsiness which is a major factor in many traffic accidents due to the clear decline in the attention and recognition of danger drivers. The object of this work is to develop an automatic method to evaluate the drowsiness stage by analysis of EEG signals records. The absolute band power of the EEG signal was computed by taking the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the time series signal. Finally, the algorithm developed in this work has been improved on eight samples from the Physionet sleep-EDF database. 
### 706.Self-weighted Multiple Kernel Learning for Graph-based Clustering and  Semi-supervised Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07697.pdf)
> Multiple kernel learning (MKL) method is generally believed to perform better than single kernel method. However, some empirical studies show that this is not always true: the combination of multiple kernels may even yield an even worse performance than using a single kernel. There are two possible reasons for the failure: (i) most existing MKL methods assume that the optimal kernel is a linear combination of base kernels, which may not hold true; and (ii) some kernel weights are inappropriately assigned due to noises and carelessly designed algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel MKL framework by following two intuitive assumptions: (i) each kernel is a perturbation of the consensus kernel; and (ii) the kernel that is close to the consensus kernel should be assigned a large weight. Impressively, the proposed method can automatically assign an appropriate weight to each kernel without introducing additional parameters, as existing methods do. The proposed framework is integrated into a unified framework for graph-based clustering and semi-supervised classification. We have conducted experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and our empirical results verify the superiority of the proposed framework. 
### 707.Method to Annotate Arrhythmias by Deep Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07715.pdf)
> This study targets to automatically annotate on arrhythmia by deep network. The investigated types include sinus rhythm, asystole (Asys), supraventricular tachycardia (Tachy), ventricular flutter or fibrillation (VF/VFL), ventricular tachycardia (VT). Methods: 13s limb lead ECG chunks from MIT malignant ventricular arrhythmia database (VFDB) and MIT normal sinus rhythm database were partitioned into subsets for 5-fold cross validation. These signals were resampled to 200Hz, filtered to remove baseline wandering, projected to 2D gray spectrum and then fed into a deep network with brand-new structure. In this network, a feature vector for a single time point was retrieved by residual layers, from which latent representation was extracted by variational autoencoder (VAE). These front portions were trained to meet a certain threshold in loss function, then fixed while training procedure switched to remaining bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN), the very portions to predict an arrhythmia category. Attention windows were polynomial lumped on RNN outputs for learning from details to outlines. And over sampling was employed for imbalanced data. The trained model was wrapped into docker image for deployment in edge or cloud. Conclusion: Promising sensitivities were achieved in four arrhythmias and good precision rates in two ventricular arrhythmias were also observed. Moreover, it was proven that latent representation by VAE, can significantly boost the speed of convergence and accuracy. 
### 708.Virtual Codec Supervised Re-Sampling Network for Image Compression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08514.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose an image re-sampling compression method by learning virtual codec network (VCN) to resolve the non-differentiable problem of quantization function for image compression. Here, the image re-sampling not only refers to image full-resolution re-sampling but also low-resolution re-sampling. We generalize this method for standard-compliant image compression (SCIC) framework and deep neural networks based compression (DNNC) framework. Specifically, an input image is measured by re-sampling network (RSN) network to get re-sampled vectors. Then, these vectors are directly quantized in the feature space in SCIC, or discrete cosine transform coefficients of these vectors are quantized to further improve coding efficiency in DNNC. At the encoder, the quantized vectors or coefficients are losslessly compressed by arithmetic coding. At the receiver, the decoded vectors are utilized to restore input image by image decoder network (IDN). In order to train RSN network and IDN network together in an end-to-end fashion, our VCN network intimates projection from the re-sampled vectors to the IDN-decoded image. As a result, gradients from IDN network to RSN network can be approximated by VCN network's gradient. Because dimension reduction can be further achieved by quantization in some dimensional space after image re-sampling within auto-encoder architecture, we can well initialize our networks from pre-trained auto-encoder networks. Through extensive experiments and analysis, it is verified that the proposed method has more effectiveness and versatility than many state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 709.A probabilistic atlas of the human thalamic nuclei combining ex vivo MRI  and histology [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08634.pdf)
> The human thalamus is a brain structure that comprises numerous, highly specific nuclei. Since these nuclei are known to have different functions and to be connected to different areas of the cerebral cortex, it is of great interest for the neuroimaging community to study their volume, shape and connectivity in vivo with MRI. In this study, we present a probabilistic atlas of the thalamic nuclei built using ex vivo brain MRI scans and histological data, as well as the application of the atlas to in vivo MRI segmentation. The atlas was built using manual delineation of 26 thalamic nuclei on the serial histology of 12 whole thalami from six autopsy samples, combined with manual segmentations of the whole thalamus and surrounding structures (caudate, putamen, hippocampus, etc.) made on in vivo brain MR data from 39 subjects. The 3D structure of the histological data and corresponding manual segmentations was recovered using the ex vivo MRI as reference frame, and stacks of blockface photographs acquired during the sectioning as intermediate target. The atlas, which was encoded as an adaptive tetrahedral mesh, shows a good agreement with with previous histological studies of the thalamus in terms of volumes of representative nuclei. When applied to segmentation of in vivo scans using Bayesian inference, the atlas shows excellent test-retest reliability, robustness to changes in input MRI contrast, and ability to detect differential thalamic effects in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The probabilistic atlas and companion segmentation tool are publicly available as part of the neuroimaging package FreeSurfer. 
### 710.Variational Bi-domain Triplet Autoencoder [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08672.pdf)
> We investigate deep generative models, which allow us to use training data from one domain to build a model for another domain. We consider domains to have similar structure (texts, images). We propose the Variational Bi-domain Triplet Autoencoder (VBTA) that learns a joint distribution of objects from different domains. There are many cases when obtaining any supervision (e.g. paired data) is difficult or ambiguous. For such cases we can seek a method that is able to the information about data relation and structure from the latent space. We extend the VBTAs objective function by the relative constraints or triplets that sampled from the shared latent space across domains. In other words, we combine the deep generative model with a metric learning ideas in order to improve the final objective with the triplets information. We demonstrate the performance of the VBTA model on different tasks: bi-directional image generation, image-to-image translation, even on unpaired data. We also provide the qualitative analysis. We show that VBTA model is comparable and outperforms some of the existing generative models. 
### 711.Toward Performance Optimization in IoT-based Next-Gen Wireless Sensor  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09980.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel framework for performance optimization in Internet of Things (IoT)-based next-generation wireless sensor networks. In particular, a computationally-convenient system is presented to combat two major research problems in sensor networks. First is the conventionally-tackled resource optimization problem which triggers the drainage of battery at a faster rate within a network. Such drainage promotes inefficient resource usage thereby causing sudden death of the network. The second main bottleneck for such networks is that of data degradation. This is because the nodes in such networks communicate via a wireless channel, where the inevitable presence of noise corrupts the data making it unsuitable for practical applications. Therefore, we present a layer-adaptive method via 3-tier communication mechanism to ensure the efficient use of resources. This is supported with a mathematical coverage model that deals with the formation of coverage holes. We also present a transform-domain based robust algorithm to effectively remove the unwanted components from the data. Our proposed framework offers a handy algorithm that enjoys desirable complexity for real-time applications as shown by the extensive simulation results. 
### 712.Improving Pursuit Algorithms Using Stochastic Resonance [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10171.pdf)
> Sparse Representation Theory is a sub-field of signal processing that has led to cutting edge results in many applications such as denoising, deblurring, super resolution and many other inverse problems. Broadly speaking, this field puts forward a model that assumes that signals are originated from a sparse representation in terms of an over-complete dictionary. Thus, when a corrupted measurement is given, we seek to estimate its original, clean form by finding the best matched sparse representation of the given signal in the dictionary domain. This process is essentially a non-linear estimation solved by a pursuit or a sparse coding algorithm. <br />The concept of Stochastic Resonance (SR) refers to the counter-intuitive idea of improving algorithms' performance by a deliberate noise contamination. In this work we develop novel techniques that apply SR for enhancement of the performance of known pursuit algorithms. We show that these methods provide an effective MMSE approximation and are capable of doing so for high-dimensional problems, for which no alternative exists.
