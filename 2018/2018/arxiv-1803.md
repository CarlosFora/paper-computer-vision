### 1.Speeding Up the Bilateral Filter: A Joint Acceleration Way [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00004.pdf)
> Computational complexity of the brute-force implementation of the bilateral filter (BF) depends on its filter kernel size. To achieve the constant-time BF whose complexity is irrelevant to the kernel size, many techniques have been proposed, such as 2D box filtering, dimension promotion, and shiftability property. Although each of the above techniques suffers from accuracy and efficiency problems, previous algorithm designers were used to take only one of them to assemble fast implementations due to the hardness of combining them together. Hence, no joint exploitation of these techniques has been proposed to construct a new cutting edge implementation that solves these problems. Jointly employing five techniques: kernel truncation, best N -term approximation as well as previous 2D box filtering, dimension promotion, and shiftability property, we propose a unified framework to transform BF with arbitrary spatial and range kernels into a set of 3D box filters that can be computed in linear time. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first method that can integrate all these acceleration techniques and, therefore, can draw upon one another's strong point to overcome deficiencies. The strength of our method has been corroborated by several carefully designed experiments. In particular, the filtering accuracy is significantly improved without sacrificing the efficiency at running time. 
### 2.Hardware-Efficient Guided Image Filtering For Multi-Label Problem [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00005.pdf)
> The Guided Filter (GF) is well-known for its linear complexity. However, when filtering an image with an n-channel guidance, GF needs to invert an n x n matrix for each pixel. To the best of our knowledge existing matrix inverse algorithms are inefficient on current hardwares. This shortcoming limits applications of multichannel guidance in computation intensive system such as multi-label system. We need a new GF-like filter that can perform fast multichannel image guided filtering. Since the optimal linear complexity of GF cannot be minimized further, the only way thus is to bring all potentialities of current parallel computing hardwares into full play. In this paper we propose a hardware-efficient Guided Filter (HGF), which solves the efficiency problem of multichannel guided image filtering and yields competent results when applying it to multi-label problems with synthesized polynomial multichannel guidance. Specifically, in order to boost the filtering performance, HGF takes a new matrix inverse algorithm which only involves two hardware-efficient operations: element-wise arithmetic calculations and box filtering. In order to break the linear model restriction, HGF synthesizes a polynomial multichannel guidance to introduce nonlinearity. Benefiting from our polynomial guidance and hardware-efficient matrix inverse algorithm, HGF not only is more sensitive to the underlying structure of guidance but also achieves the fastest computing speed. Due to these merits, HGF obtains state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy and efficiency in the computation intensive multi-label 
### 3.A Feature Clustering Approach Based on Histogram of Oriented Optical  Flow and Superpixels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00031.pdf)
> Visual feature clustering is one of the cost-effective approaches to segment objects in videos. However, the assumptions made for developing the existing algorithms prevent them from being used in situations like segmenting an unknown number of static and moving objects under heavy camera movements. This paper addresses the problem by introducing a clustering approach based on superpixels and short-term Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF). Salient Dither Pattern Feature (SDPF) is used as the visual feature to track the flow and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) is used for obtaining the superpixels. This new clustering approach is based on merging superpixels by comparing short term local HOOF and a color cue to form high-level semantic segments. The new approach was compared with one of the latest feature clustering approaches based on K-Means in eight-dimensional space and the results revealed that the new approach is better by means of consistency, completeness, and spatial accuracy. Further, the new approach completely solved the problem of not knowing the number of objects in a scene. 
### 4.A Retinal Image Enhancement Technique for Blood Vessel Segmentation  Algorithm [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00036.pdf)
> The morphology of blood vessels in retinal fundus images is an important indicator of diseases like glaucoma, hypertension and diabetic retinopathy. The accuracy of retinal blood vessels segmentation affects the quality of retinal image analysis which is used in diagnosis methods in modern ophthalmology. Contrast enhancement is one of the crucial steps in any of retinal blood vessel segmentation approaches. The reliability of the segmentation depends on the consistency of the contrast over the image. This paper presents an assessment of the suitability of a recently invented spatially adaptive contrast enhancement technique for enhancing retinal fundus images for blood vessel segmentation. The enhancement technique was integrated with a variant of Tyler Coye algorithm, which has been improved with Hough line transformation based vessel reconstruction method. The proposed approach was evaluated on two public datasets STARE and DRIVE. The assessment was done by comparing the segmentation performance with five widely used contrast enhancement techniques based on wavelet transform, contrast limited histogram equalization, local normalization, linear un-sharp masking and contourlet transform. The results revealed that the assessed enhancement technique is well suited for the application and also outperforms all compared techniques. 
### 5.Invariant properties of a locally salient dither pattern with a  spatial-chromatic histogram [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00037.pdf)
> Compacted Dither Pattern Code (CDPC) is a recently found feature which is successful in irregular shapes based visual depiction. Locally salient dither pattern feature is an attempt to expand the capability of CDPC for both regular and irregular shape based visual depiction. This paper presents an analysis of rotational and scale invariance property of locally salient dither pattern feature with a two dimensional spatialchromatic histogram, which expands the applicability of the visual feature. Experiments were conducted to exhibit rotational and scale invariance of the feature. These experiments were conducted by combining linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to the new feature. The experimental results revealed that the locally salient dither pattern feature with the spatialchromatic histogram is rotationally and scale invariant. 
### 6.Super-Efficient Spatially Adaptive Contrast Enhancement Algorithm for  Superficial Vein Imaging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00039.pdf)
> This paper presents a super-efficient spatially adaptive contrast enhancement algorithm for enhancing infrared (IR) radiation based superficial vein images in real-time. The super-efficiency permits the algorithm to run in consumer-grade handheld devices, which ultimately reduces the cost of vein imaging equipment. The proposed method utilizes the response from the low-frequency range of the IR image signal to adjust the boundaries of the reference dynamic range in a linear contrast stretching process with a tunable contrast enhancement parameter, as opposed to traditional approaches which use costly adaptive histogram equalization based methods. The algorithm has been implemented and deployed in a consumer grade Android-based mobile device to evaluate the performance. The results revealed that the proposed algorithm can process IR images of veins in real-time on low-performance computers. It was compared with several well-performed traditional methods and the results revealed that the new algorithm stands out with several beneficial features, namely, the fastest processing, the ability to enhance the desired details, the excellent illumination normalization capability and the ability to enhance details where the traditional methods failed. 
### 7.A Neural Multi-sequence Alignment TeCHnique (NeuMATCH) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00057.pdf)
> The alignment of heterogeneous sequential data (video to text) is an important and challenging problem. Standard techniques for this task, including Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), suffer from inherent drawbacks. Mainly, the Markov assumption implies that, given the immediate past, future alignment decisions are independent of further history. The separation between similarity computation and alignment decision also prevents end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural architecture where alignment actions are implemented as moving data between stacks of Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) blocks. This flexible architecture supports a large variety of alignment tasks, including one-to-one, one-to-many, skipping unmatched elements, and (with extensions) non-monotonic alignment. Extensive experiments on semi-synthetic and real datasets show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. 
### 8.Joint Pixel and Feature-level Domain Adaptation in the Wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00068.pdf)
> Recent developments in deep domain adaptation have allowed knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain at the level of intermediate features or input pixels. We propose that advantages may be derived by combining them, in the form of different insights that lead to a novel design and complementary properties that result in better performance. At the feature level, inspired by insights from semi-supervised learning in a domain adversarial neural network, we propose a novel regularization in the form of domain adversarial entropy minimization. Next, we posit that insights from computer vision are more amenable to injection at the pixel level and specifically address the key challenge of adaptation across different semantic levels. In particular, we use 3D geometry and image synthesization based on a generalized appearance flow to preserve identity across higher-level pose transformations, while using an attribute-conditioned CycleGAN to translate a single source into multiple target images that differ in lower-level properties such as lighting. We validate on a novel problem of car recognition in unlabeled surveillance images using labeled images from the web, handling explicitly specified, nameable factors of variation through pixel-level and implicit, unspecified factors through feature-level adaptation. Extensive experiments achieve state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of complementing feature and pixel-level information via our proposed domain adaptation method. 
### 9.Chinese Text in the Wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00085.pdf)
> We introduce Chinese Text in the Wild, a very large dataset of Chinese text in street view images. While optical character recognition (OCR) in document images is well studied and many commercial tools are available, detection and recognition of text in natural images is still a challenging problem, especially for more complicated character sets such as Chinese text. Lack of training data has always been a problem, especially for deep learning methods which require massive training data. <br />In this paper we provide details of a newly created dataset of Chinese text with about 1 million Chinese characters annotated by experts in over 30 thousand street view images. This is a challenging dataset with good diversity. It contains planar text, raised text, text in cities, text in rural areas, text under poor illumination, distant text, partially occluded text, etc. For each character in the dataset, the annotation includes its underlying character, its bounding box, and 6 attributes. The attributes indicate whether it has complex background, whether it is raised, whether it is handwritten or printed, etc. The large size and diversity of this dataset make it suitable for training robust neural networks for various tasks, particularly detection and recognition. We give baseline results using several state-of-the-art networks, including AlexNet, OverFeat, Google Inception and ResNet for character recognition, and YOLOv2 for character detection in images. Overall Google Inception has the best performance on recognition with 80.5% top-1 accuracy, while YOLOv2 achieves an mAP of 71.0% on detection. Dataset, source code and trained models will all be publicly available on the website. 
### 10.SalientDSO: Bringing Attention to Direct Sparse Odometry [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00127.pdf)
> Although cluttered indoor scenes have a lot of useful high-level semantic information which can be used for mapping and localization, most Visual Odometry (VO) algorithms rely on the usage of geometric features such as points, lines and planes. Lately, driven by this idea, the joint optimization of semantic labels and obtaining odometry has gained popularity in the robotics community. The joint optimization is good for accurate results but is generally very slow. At the same time, in the vision community, direct and sparse approaches for VO have stricken the right balance between speed and accuracy. <br />We merge the successes of these two communities and present a way to incorporate semantic information in the form of visual saliency to Direct Sparse Odometry - a highly successful direct sparse VO algorithm. We also present a framework to filter the visual saliency based on scene parsing. Our framework, SalientDSO, relies on the widely successful deep learning based approaches for visual saliency and scene parsing which drives the feature selection for obtaining highly-accurate and robust VO even in the presence of as few as 40 point features per frame. We provide extensive quantitative evaluation of SalientDSO on the ICL-NUIM and TUM monoVO datasets and show that we outperform DSO and ORB-SLAM - two very popular state-of-the-art approaches in the literature. We also collect and publicly release a CVL-UMD dataset which contains two indoor cluttered sequences on which we show qualitative evaluations. To our knowledge this is the first paper to use visual saliency and scene parsing to drive the feature selection in direct VO. 
### 11.Ring loss: Convex Feature Normalization for Face Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00130.pdf)
> We motivate and present Ring loss, a simple and elegant feature normalization approach for deep networks designed to augment standard loss functions such as Softmax. We argue that deep feature normalization is an important aspect of supervised classification problems where we require the model to represent each class in a multi-class problem equally well. The direct approach to feature normalization through the hard normalization operation results in a non-convex formulation. Instead, Ring loss applies soft normalization, where it gradually learns to constrain the norm to the scaled unit circle while preserving convexity leading to more robust features. We apply Ring loss to large-scale face recognition problems and present results on LFW, the challenging protocols of IJB-A Janus, Janus CS3 (a superset of IJB-A Janus), Celebrity Frontal-Profile (CFP) and MegaFace with 1 million distractors. Ring loss outperforms strong baselines, matches state-of-the-art performance on IJB-A Janus and outperforms all other results on the challenging Janus CS3 thereby achieving state-of-the-art. We also outperform strong baselines in handling extremely low resolution face matching. 
### 12.A Class-Incremental Learning Method Based on One Class Support Vector  Machine [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00159.pdf)
> A method based on one class support vector machine (OCSVM) is proposed for class incremental learning. Several OCSVM models divide the input space into several parts. Then, the 1VS1 classifiers are constructed for the confuse part by using the support vectors. During the class incremental learning process, the OCSVM of the new class is trained at first. Then the support vectors of the old classes and the support vectors of the new class are reused to train 1VS1 classifiers for the confuse part. In order to bring more information to the certain support vectors, the support vectors are at the boundary of the distribution of samples as much as possible when the OCSVM is built. Compared with the traditional methods, the proposed method retains the original model and thus reduces memory consumption and training time cost. Various experiments on different datasets also verify the efficiency of the proposed method. 
### 13.Facial Expression Recognition Based on Complexity Perception  Classification Algorithm [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00185.pdf)
> Facial expression recognition (FER) has always been a challenging issue in computer vision. The different expressions of emotion and uncontrolled environmental factors lead to inconsistencies in the complexity of FER and variability of between expression categories, which is often overlooked in most facial expression recognition systems. In order to solve this problem effectively, we presented a simple and efficient CNN model to extract facial features, and proposed a complexity perception classification (CPC) algorithm for FER. The CPC algorithm divided the dataset into an easy classification sample subspace and a complex classification sample subspace by evaluating the complexity of facial features that are suitable for classification. The experimental results of our proposed algorithm on Fer2013 and CK-plus datasets demonstrated the algorithm's effectiveness and superiority over other state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 14.Temporally Identity-Aware SSD with Attentional LSTM [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00197.pdf)
> Temporal object detection has attracted significant attention, but most popular detection methods can not leverage the rich temporal information in videos. Very recently, many different algorithms have been developed for video detection task, but real-time online approaches are frequently deficient. In this paper, based on attention mechanism and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), we propose a temporal signal-shot detector (TSSD) for real-world detection. Distinct from previous methods, we take aim at temporally integrating pyramidal feature hierarchy using ConvLSTM, and design a novel structure including a low-level temporal unit as well as a high-level one (HL-TU) for multi-scale feature maps. Moreover, we develop a creative temporal analysis unit, namely, attentional ConvLSTM (AC-LSTM), in which a temporal attention module is specially tailored for background suppression and scale suppression while a ConvLSTM integrates attention-aware features through time. An association loss is designed for temporal coherence. Besides, online tubelet analysis (OTA) is exploited for identification. Finally, our method is evaluated on ImageNet VID dataset and 2DMOT15 dataset. Extensive comparisons on the detection and tracking capability validate the superiority of the proposed approach. Consequently, the developed TSSD-OTA is fairly faster and achieves an overall competitive performance in terms of detection and tracking. The source code will be made available. 
### 15.Tongue image constitution recognition based on Complexity Perception  method [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00219.pdf)
> Background and Object: In China, body constitution is highly related to physiological and pathological functions of human body and determines the tendency of the disease, which is of great importance for treatment in clinical medicine. Tongue diagnosis, as a key part of Traditional Chinese Medicine inspection, is an important way to recognize the type of constitution.In order to deploy tongue image constitution recognition system on non-invasive mobile device to achieve fast, efficient and accurate constitution recognition, an efficient method is required to deal with the challenge of this kind of complex environment. Methods: In this work, we perform the tongue area detection, tongue area calibration and constitution classification using methods which are based on deep convolutional neural network. Subject to the variation of inconstant environmental condition, the distribution of the picture is uneven, which has a bad effect on classification performance. To solve this problem, we propose a method based on the complexity of individual instances to divide dataset into two subsets and classify them separately, which is capable of improving classification accuracy. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on three sizes of tongue datasets, in which deep convolutional neural network method and traditional digital image analysis method are respectively applied to extract features for tongue images. The proposed method is combined with the base classifier Softmax, SVM, and DecisionTree respectively. Results: As the experiments results shown, our proposed method improves the classification accuracy by 1.135% on average and achieves 59.99% constitution classification accuracy. Conclusions: Experimental results on three datasets show that our proposed method can effectively improve the classification accuracy of tongue constitution recognition. 
### 16.WRPN &amp; Apprentice: Methods for Training and Inference using  Low-Precision Numerics [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00227.pdf)
> Today's high performance deep learning architectures involve large models with numerous parameters. Low precision numerics has emerged as a popular technique to reduce both the compute and memory requirements of these large models. However, lowering precision often leads to accuracy degradation. We describe three schemes whereby one can both train and do efficient inference using low precision numerics without hurting accuracy. Finally, we describe an efficient hardware accelerator that can take advantage of the proposed low precision numerics. 
### 17.DRUNET: A Dilated-Residual U-Net Deep Learning Network to Digitally  Stain Optic Nerve Head Tissues in Optical Coherence Tomography Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00232.pdf)
> Given that the neural and connective tissues of the optic nerve head (ONH) exhibit complex morphological changes with the development and progression of glaucoma, their simultaneous isolation from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images may be of great interest for the clinical diagnosis and management of this pathology. A deep learning algorithm was designed and trained to digitally stain (i.e. highlight) 6 ONH tissue layers by capturing both the local (tissue texture) and contextual information (spatial arrangement of tissues). The overall dice coefficient (mean of all tissues) was $0.91 \pm 0.05$ when assessed against manual segmentations performed by an expert observer. We offer here a robust segmentation framework that could be extended for the automated parametric study of the ONH tissues. 
### 18.Scalable Dense Non-rigid Structure-from-Motion: A Grassmannian  Perspective [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00233.pdf)
> This paper addresses the task of dense non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM) using multiple images. State-of-the-art methods to this problem are often hurdled by scalability, expensive computations, and noisy measurements. Further, recent methods to NRSfM usually either assume a small number of sparse feature points or ignore local non-linearities of shape deformations, and thus cannot reliably model complex non-rigid deformations. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new approach for dense NRSfM by modeling the problem on a Grassmann manifold. Specifically, we assume the complex non-rigid deformations lie on a union of local linear subspaces both spatially and temporally. This naturally allows for a compact representation of the complex non-rigid deformation over frames. We provide experimental results on several synthetic and real benchmark datasets. The procured results clearly demonstrate that our method, apart from being scalable and more accurate than state-of-the-art methods, is also more robust to noise and generalizes to highly non-linear deformations. 
### 19.Five-point Fundamental Matrix Estimation for Uncalibrated Cameras [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00260.pdf)
> We aim at estimating the fundamental matrix in two views from five correspondences of rotation invariant features obtained by e.g.\ the SIFT detector. The proposed minimal solver first estimates a homography from three correspondences assuming that they are co-planar and exploiting their rotational components. Then the fundamental matrix is obtained from the homography and two additional point pairs in general position. The proposed approach, combined with robust estimators like Graph-Cut RANSAC, is superior to other state-of-the-art algorithms both in terms of accuracy and number of iterations required. This is validated on synthesized data and $561$ real image pairs. Moreover, the tests show that requiring three points on a plane is not too restrictive in urban environment and locally optimized robust estimators lead to accurate estimates even if the points are not entirely co-planar. As a potential application, we show that using the proposed method makes two-view multi-motion estimation more accurate. 
### 20.Detecting Volcano Deformation in InSAR using Deep learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00380.pdf)
> Globally 800 million people live within 100 km of a volcano and currently 1500 volcanoes are considered active, but half of these have no ground-based monitoring. Alternatively, satellite radar (InSAR) can be employed to observe volcanic ground deformation, which has shown a significant statistical link to eruptions. Modern satellites provide large coverage with high resolution signals, leading to huge amounts of data. The explosion in data has brought major challenges associated with timely dissemination of information and distinguishing volcano deformation patterns from noise, which currently relies on manual inspection. Moreover, volcano observatories still lack expertise to exploit satellite datasets, particularly in developing countries. This paper presents a novel approach to detect volcanic ground deformation automatically from wrapped-phase InSAR images. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are employed to detect unusual patterns within the radar data. 
### 21.Fibres of Failure: Classifying errors in predictive processes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00384.pdf)
> We describe Fibres of Failure (FiFa), a method to classify failure modes of predictive processes using the Mapper algorithm from Topological Data Analysis. <br />Our method uses Mapper to build a graph model of input data stratified by prediction error. <br />Groupings found in high-error regions of the Mapper model then provide distinct failure modes of the predictive process. <br />We demonstrate FiFa on misclassifications of MNIST images with added noise, and demonstrate two ways to use the failure mode classification: either to produce a correction layer that adjusts predictions by similarity to the failure modes; or to inspect members of the failure modes to illustrate and investigate what characterizes each failure mode. 
### 22.MAGAN: Aligning Biological Manifolds [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00385.pdf)
> It is increasingly common in many types of natural and physical systems (especially biological systems) to have different types of measurements performed on the same underlying system. In such settings, it is important to align the manifolds arising from each measurement in order to integrate such data and gain an improved picture of the system. We tackle this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Recently, GANs have been utilized to try to find correspondences between sets of samples. However, these GANs are not explicitly designed for proper alignment of manifolds. We present a new GAN called the Manifold-Aligning GAN (MAGAN) that aligns two manifolds such that related points in each measurement space are aligned together. We demonstrate applications of MAGAN in single-cell biology in integrating two different measurement types together. In our demonstrated examples, cells from the same tissue are measured with both genomic (single-cell RNA-sequencing) and proteomic (mass cytometry) technologies. We show that the MAGAN successfully aligns them such that known correlations between measured markers are improved compared to other recently proposed models. 
### 23.Context-Aware Learning using Transferable Features for Classification of  Breast Cancer Histology Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00386.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been recently used for a variety of histology image analysis. However, availability of a large dataset is a major prerequisite for training a CNN which limits its use by the computational pathology community. In previous studies, CNNs have demonstrated their potential in terms of feature generalizability and transferability accompanied with better performance. Considering these traits of CNN, we propose a simple yet effective method which leverages the strengths of CNN combined with the advantages of including contextual information, particularly designed for a small dataset. Our method consists of two main steps: first it uses the activation features of CNN trained for a patch-based classification and then it trains a separate classifier using features of overlapping patches to perform image-based classification using the contextual information. The proposed framework outperformed the state-of-the-art method for breast cancer classification. 
### 24.A General Pipeline for 3D Detection of Vehicles [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00387.pdf)
> Autonomous driving requires 3D perception of vehicles and other objects in the in environment. Much of the current methods support 2D vehicle detection. This paper proposes a flexible pipeline to adopt any 2D detection network and fuse it with a 3D point cloud to generate 3D information with minimum changes of the 2D detection networks. To identify the 3D box, an effective model fitting algorithm is developed based on generalised car models and score maps. A two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to refine the detected 3D box. This pipeline is tested on the KITTI dataset using two different 2D detection networks. The 3D detection results based on these two networks are similar, demonstrating the flexibility of the proposed pipeline. The results rank second among the 3D detection algorithms, indicating its competencies in 3D detection. 
### 25.Learning Filter Scale and Orientation In CNNs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00388.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks have many hyperparameters such as the filter size, number of filters, and pooling size, which require manual tuning. Though deep stacked structures are able to create multi-scale and hierarchical representations, manually fixed filter sizes limit the scale of representations that can be learned in a single convolutional layer. <br />This paper introduces a new adaptive filter model that allows variable scale and orientation. The scale and orientation parameters of filters can be learned using back propagation. Therefore, in a single convolution layer, we can create filters of different scale and orientation that can adapt to small or large features and objects. The proposed model uses a relatively large base size (grid) for filters. In the grid, a differentiable function acts as an envelope for the filters. The envelope function guides effective filter scale and shape/orientation by masking the filter weights before the convolution. Therefore, only the weights in the envelope are updated during training. <br />In this work, we employed a multivariate (2D) Gaussian as the envelope function and showed that it can grow, shrink, or rotate by updating its covariance matrix during back propagation training . We tested the new filter model on MNIST, MNIST-cluttered, and CIFAR-10 and compared the results with the networks that used conventional convolution layers. The results demonstrate that the new model can effectively learn and produce filters of different scales and orientations in a single layer. Moreover, the experiments show that the adaptive convolution layers perform equally; or better, especially when data includes objects of varying scale and noisy backgrounds. 
### 26.Poisson Image Denoising Using Best Linear Prediction: A Post-processing  Framework [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00389.pdf)
> In this paper, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise. We propose a new patch-based approach based on best linear prediction to estimate the underlying clean image. A simplified prediction formula is derived for Poisson observations, which requires the covariance matrix of the underlying clean patch. We use the assumption that similar patches in a neighborhood share the same covariance matrix, and we use off-the-shelf Poisson denoising methods in order to obtain an initial estimate of the covariance matrices. Our method can be seen as a post-processing step for Poisson denoising methods and the results show that it improves upon several Poisson denoising methods by relevant margins. 
### 27.Image Dataset for Visual Objects Classification in 3D Printing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00391.pdf)
> The rapid development in additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, has brought about potential risk and security issues along with significant benefits. In order to enhance the security level of the 3D printing process, the present research aims to detect and recognize illegal components using deep learning. In this work, we collected a dataset of 61,340 2D images (28x28 for each image) of 10 classes including guns and other non-gun objects, corresponding to the projection results of the original 3D models. To validate the dataset, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for gun classification which can achieve 98.16% classification accuracy. 
### 28.Fast and robust misalignment correction of Fourier ptychographic  microscopy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00395.pdf)
> Fourier ptychographi cmicroscopy(FPM) is a newly developed computational imaging technique that can provide gigapixel images with both high resolution (HR) and wide field of view (FOV). However, the positional misalignment of the LED array induces a degradation of the reconstruction, especially in the regions away from the optical axis. In this paper, we propose a robust and fast method to correct the LED misalignment of FPM, termed as misalignment correction for FPM (mcFPM). Although different regions in the FOV have different sensitivity to the LED misalignment, the experimental results show that mcFPM is robust to eliminate the degradation in each region. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, mcFPM is much faster. 
### 29.Satellite imagery analysis for operational damage assessment in  Emergency situations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00397.pdf)
> When major disaster occurs the questions are raised how to estimate the damage in time to support the decision making process and relief efforts by local authorities or humanitarian teams. In this paper we consider the use of Machine Learning and Computer Vision on remote sensing imagery to improve time efficiency of assessment of damaged buildings in disaster affected area. We propose a general workflow that can be useful in various disaster management applications, and demonstrate the use of the proposed workflow for the assessment of the damage caused by the wildfires in California in 2017. 
### 30.Robust positioning of drones for land use monitoring in strong terrain  relief using vision-based navigation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00398.pdf)
> For land use monitoring, the main problems are robust positioning in urban canyons and strong terrain reliefs with the use of GPS system only. Indeed, satellite signal reflection and shielding in urban canyons and strong terrain relief results in problems with correct positioning. Using GNSS-RTK does not solve the problem completely because in some complex situations the whole satellite's system works incorrectly. We transform the weakness (urban canyons and strong terrain relief) to an advantage. It is a vision-based navigation using a map of the terrain relief. We investigate and demonstrate the effectiveness of this technology in Chinese region Xiaoshan. The accuracy of the vision-based navigation system corresponds to the expected for these conditions. . It was concluded that the maximum position error based on vision-based navigation is 20 m and the maximum angle Euler error based on vision-based navigation is 0.83 degree. In case of camera movement, the maximum position error based on vision-based navigation is 30m and the maximum Euler angle error based on vision-based navigation is 2.2 degrees. 
### 31.Calcium Removal From Cardiac CT Images Using Deep Convolutional Neural  Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00399.pdf)
> Coronary calcium causes beam hardening and blooming artifacts on cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) images, which lead to overestimation of lumen stenosis and reduction of diagnostic specificity. To properly remove coronary calcification and restore arterial lumen precisely, we propose a machine learning-based method with a multi-step inpainting process. We developed a new network configuration, Dense-Unet, to achieve optimal performance with low computational cost. Results after the calcium removal process were validated by comparing with gold-standard X-ray angiography. Our results demonstrated that removing coronary calcification from images with the proposed approach was feasible, and may potentially improve the diagnostic accuracy of CTA. 
### 32.Unravelling Robustness of Deep Learning based Face Recognition Against  Adversarial Attacks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00401.pdf)
> Deep neural network (DNN) architecture based models have high expressive power and learning capacity. However, they are essentially a black box method since it is not easy to mathematically formulate the functions that are learned within its many layers of representation. Realizing this, many researchers have started to design methods to exploit the drawbacks of deep learning based algorithms questioning their robustness and exposing their singularities. In this paper, we attempt to unravel three aspects related to the robustness of DNNs for face recognition: (i) assessing the impact of deep architectures for face recognition in terms of vulnerabilities to attacks inspired by commonly observed distortions in the real world that are well handled by shallow learning methods along with learning based adversaries; (ii) detecting the singularities by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden layers of deep networks; and (iii) making corrections to the processing pipeline to alleviate the problem. Our experimental evaluation using multiple open-source DNN-based face recognition networks, including OpenFace and VGG-Face, and two publicly available databases (MEDS and PaSC) demonstrates that the performance of deep learning based face recognition algorithms can suffer greatly in the presence of such distortions. The proposed method is also compared with existing detection algorithms and the results show that it is able to detect the attacks with very high accuracy by suitably designing a classifier using the response of the hidden layers in the network. Finally, we present several effective countermeasures to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks and improve the overall robustness of DNN-based face recognition. 
### 33.Deep Defense: Training DNNs with Improved Adversarial Robustness [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00404.pdf)
> Despite the efficacy on a variety of computer vision tasks, deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their applications in security-critical systems. Recent works have shown the possibility of generating imperceptibly perturbed image inputs (a.k.a., adversarial examples) to fool well-trained DNN classifiers into making arbitrary predictions. To address this problem, we propose a training recipe named "deep defense". Our core idea is to integrate an adversarial perturbation-based regularizer into the classification objective, such that the obtained models learn to resist potential attacks, directly and precisely. The whole optimization problem is solved just like training a recursive network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms training with adversarial/Parseval regularizations by large margins on various datasets (including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) and different DNN architectures. Code and models for reproducing our results will be made publicly available. 
### 34.Left ventricle segmentation By modelling uncertainty in prediction of  deep convolutional neural networks and adaptive thresholding inference [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00406.pdf)
> Deep neural networks have shown great achievements in solving complex problems. However, there are fundamental problems that limit their real world applications. Lack of measurable criteria for estimating uncertainty in the network outputs is one of these problems. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing deformation to the network input and measuring the level of stability in the network's output. We calculate simple random transformations to estimate the prediction uncertainty of deep convolutional neural networks. For a real use-case, we apply this method to left ventricle segmentation in MRI cardiac images. We also propose an adaptive thresholding method to consider the deep neural network uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and highlight the capabilities of simple methods in conjunction with deep neural networks. 
### 35.Yedrouj-Net: An efficient CNN for spatial steganalysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00407.pdf)
> For about 10 years, detecting the presence of a secret message hidden in an image was performed with an Ensemble Classifier trained with Rich features. In recent years, studies such as Xu et al. have indicated that well-designed convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can achieve comparable performance to the two-step machine learning approaches. <br />In this paper, we propose a CNN that outperforms the state-ofthe-art in terms of error probability. The proposition is in the continuity of what has been recently proposed and it is a clever fusion of important bricks used in various papers. Among the essential parts of the CNN, one can cite the use of a pre-processing filterbank and a Truncation activation function, five convolutional layers with a Batch Normalization associated with a Scale Layer, as well as the use of a sufficiently sized fully connected section. An augmented database has also been used to improve the training of the CNN. <br />Our CNN was experimentally evaluated against S-UNIWARD and WOW embedding algorithms and its performances were compared with those of three other methods: an Ensemble Classifier plus a Rich Model, and two other CNN steganalyzers. 
### 36.Graph Kernels based on High Order Graphlet Parsing and Hashing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00425.pdf)
> Graph-based methods are known to be successful in many machine learning and pattern classification tasks. These methods consider semi-structured data as graphs where nodes correspond to primitives (parts, interest points, segments, etc.) and edges characterize the relationships between these primitives. However, these non-vectorial graph data cannot be straightforwardly plugged into off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms without a preliminary step of -- explicit/implicit -- graph vectorization and embedding. This embedding process should be resilient to intra-class graph variations while being highly discriminant. In this paper, we propose a novel high-order stochastic graphlet embedding (SGE) that maps graphs into vector spaces. Our main contribution includes a new stochastic search procedure that efficiently parses a given graph and extracts/samples unlimitedly high-order graphlets. We consider these graphlets, with increasing orders, to model local primitives as well as their increasingly complex interactions. In order to build our graph representation, we measure the distribution of these graphlets into a given graph, using particular hash functions that efficiently assign sampled graphlets into isomorphic sets with a very low probability of collision. When combined with maximum margin classifiers, these graphlet-based representations have positive impact on the performance of pattern comparison and recognition as corroborated through extensive experiments using standard benchmark databases. 
### 37.LCR-Net++: Multi-person 2D and 3D Pose Detection in Natural Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00455.pdf)
> We propose an end-to-end architecture for joint 2D and 3D human pose estimation in natural images. Key to our approach is the generation and scoring of a number of pose proposals per image, which allows us to predict 2D and 3D poses of multiple people simultaneously. Hence, our approach does not require an approximate localization of the humans for initialization. Our Localization-Classification-Regression architecture, named LCR-Net, contains 3 main components: 1) the pose proposal generator that suggests candidate poses at different locations in the image; 2) a classifier that scores the different pose proposals; and 3) a regressor that refines pose proposals both in 2D and 3D. All three stages share the convolutional feature layers and are trained jointly. The final pose estimation is obtained by integrating over neighboring pose hypotheses, which is shown to improve over a standard non maximum suppression algorithm. Our method recovers full-body 2D and 3D poses, hallucinating plausible body parts when the persons are partially occluded or truncated by the image boundary. Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art in 3D pose estimation on Human3.6M, a controlled environment. Moreover, it shows promising results on real images for both single and multi-person subsets of the MPII 2D pose benchmark and demonstrates satisfying 3D pose results even for multi-person images. 
### 38.The 2018 DAVIS Challenge on Video Object Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00557.pdf)
> We present the 2018 DAVIS Challenge on Video Object Segmentation, a public competition specifically designed for the task of video object segmentation. It builds upon the DAVIS 2017 dataset, which was presented in the previous edition of the DAVIS Challenge, and added 100 videos with multiple objects per sequence to the original DAVIS 2016 dataset. Motivated by the analysis of the results of the 2017 edition, the main track of the competition will be the same than in the previous edition (segmentation given the full mask of the objects in the first frame -- semi-supervised scenario). This edition, however, also adds an interactive segmentation teaser track, where the participants will interact with a web service simulating the input of a human that provides scribbles to iteratively improve the result. 
### 39.SD-CNN: a Shallow-Deep CNN for Improved Breast Cancer Diagnosis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00663.pdf)
> Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Nevertheless, it is also one of the most treatable malignances if detected early. Screening for breast cancer with digital mammography (DM) has been widely used. However it demonstrates limited sensitivity for women with dense breasts. An emerging technology in the field is contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM), which includes a low energy (LE) image similar to DM, and a recombined image leveraging tumor neoangiogenesis similar to breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CEDM has shown better diagnostic accuracy than DM. While promising, CEDM is not yet widely available across medical centers. In this research, we propose a Shallow-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (SD-CNN) where a shallow CNN is developed to derive "virtual" recombined images from LE images, and a deep CNN is employed to extract novel features from LE, recombined or "virtual" recombined images for ensemble models to classify the cases as benign vs. cancer. To evaluate the validity of our approach, we first develop a deep-CNN using 49 CEDM cases collected from Mayo Clinic to prove the contributions from recombined images for improved breast cancer diagnosis (0.86 in accuracy using LE imaging vs. 0.90 in accuracy using both LE and recombined imaging). We then develop a shallow-CNN using the same 49 CEDM cases to learn the nonlinear mapping from LE to recombined images. Next, we use 69 DM cases collected from the hospital located at Zhejiang University, China to generate "virtual" recombined images. Using DM alone provides 0.91 in accuracy, whereas SD-CNN improves the diagnostic accuracy to 0.95. 
### 40.Constrained Neural Style Transfer for Decorated Logo Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00686.pdf)
> Making decorated logos requires image editing skills, without sufficient skills, it could be a time-consuming task. While there are many on-line web services to make new logos, they have limited designs and duplicates can be made. We propose using neural style transfer with clip art and text for the creation of new and genuine logos. We introduce a new loss function based on distance transform of the input image, which allows the preservation of the silhouettes of text and objects. The proposed method constrains style transfer only around the designated area. We demonstrate the characteristics of proposed method. Finally, we show the results of logo generation with various input images. 
### 41.Fusion of multispectral satellite imagery using a cluster of graphics  processing unit [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00737.pdf)
> The paper presents a parallel implementation of existing image fusion methods on a graphical cluster. Parallel implementations of methods based on discrete wavelet transformation (Haars and Daubechies discrete wavelet transform) are developed. Experiments were performed on a cluster using GPU and CPU and performance gains were estimated for the use of the developed parallel implementations to process satellite images from satellite Landsat 7. The implementation on a graphic cluster provides performance improvement from 2 to 18 times. The quality of the considered methods was evaluated by ERGAS and QNR metrics. The results show performance gains and retaining of quality with the cluster of GPU compared to the results obtained by the authors and other researchers for a CPU and single GPU. 
### 42.Aspl{&#xfc;}nd&#x27;s metric defined in the Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP)  framework for colour and multivariate images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00764.pdf)
> Aspl{\"u}nd's metric, which is useful for pattern matching, consists in a double-sided probing, i.e. the over-graph and the sub-graph of a function are probed jointly. It has previously been defined for grey-scale images using the Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) framework. LIP is a non-linear model to perform operations between images while being consistent with the human visual system. Our contribution consists in extending the Aspl{\"u}nd's metric to colour and multivariate images using the LIP framework. Aspl{\"u}nd's metric is insensitive to lighting variations and we propose a colour variant which is robust to noise. 
### 43.Automated Map Reading: Image Based Localisation in 2-D Maps Using Binary  Semantic Descriptors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00788.pdf)
> We describe a novel approach to image based localisation in urban environments using semantic matching between images and a 2-D map. It contrasts with the vast majority of existing approaches which use image to image database matching. We use highly compact binary descriptors to represent semantic features at locations, significantly increasing scalability compared with existing methods and having the potential for greater invariance to variable imaging conditions. The approach is also more akin to human map reading, making it more suited to human-system interaction. The binary descriptors indicate the presence or not of semantic features relating to buildings and road junctions in discrete viewing directions. We use CNN classifiers to detect the features in images and match descriptor estimates with a database of location tagged descriptors derived from the 2-D map. In isolation, the descriptors are not sufficiently discriminative, but when concatenated sequentially along a route, their combination becomes highly distinctive and allows localisation even when using non-perfect classifiers. Performance is further improved by taking into account left or right turns over a route. Experimental results obtained using Google StreetView and OpenStreetMap data show that the approach has considerable potential, achieving localisation accuracy of around 85% using routes corresponding to approximately 200 meters. 
### 44.Unsupervised Deep Single-Image Intrinsic Decomposition using  Illumination-Varying Image Sequences [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00805.pdf)
> Machine learning based Single Image Intrinsic Decomposition (SIID) methods decompose a captured scene into its albedo and shading images by using the knowledge of a large set of known and realistic ground truth decompositions. Collecting and annotating such a dataset is an approach that cannot scale to sufficient variety and realism. We free ourselves from this limitation by training on unannotated images. <br />Our method leverages the observation that two images of the same scene but with different lighting provide useful information on their intrinsic properties: by definition, albedo is invariant to lighting conditions, and cross-combining the estimated albedo of a first image with the estimated shading of a second one should lead back to the second one's input image. We transcribe this relationship into a siamese training scheme for a deep convolutional neural network that decomposes a single image into albedo and shading. The siamese setting allows us to introduce a new loss function including such cross-combinations, and to train solely on (time-lapse) images, discarding the need for any ground truth annotations. <br />As a result, our method has the good properties of i) taking advantage of the time-varying information of image sequences in the (pre-computed) training step, ii) not requiring ground truth data to train on, and iii) being able to decompose single images of unseen scenes at runtime. To demonstrate and evaluate our work, we additionally propose a new rendered dataset containing illumination-varying scenes and a set of quantitative metrics to evaluate SIID algorithms. Despite its unsupervised nature, our results compete with state of the art methods, including supervised and non data-driven methods. 
### 45.Pose-Robust Face Recognition via Deep Residual Equivariant Mapping [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00839.pdf)
> Face recognition achieves exceptional success thanks to the emergence of deep learning. However, many contemporary face recognition models still perform relatively poor in processing profile faces compared to frontal faces. A key reason is that the number of frontal and profile training faces are highly imbalanced - there are extensively more frontal training samples compared to profile ones. In addition, it is intrinsically hard to learn a deep representation that is geometrically invariant to large pose variations. In this study, we hypothesize that there is an inherent mapping between frontal and profile faces, and consequently, their discrepancy in the deep representation space can be bridged by an equivariant mapping. To exploit this mapping, we formulate a novel Deep Residual EquivAriant Mapping (DREAM) block, which is capable of adaptively adding residuals to the input deep representation to transform a profile face representation to a canonical pose that simplifies recognition. The DREAM block consistently enhances the performance of profile face recognition for many strong deep networks, including ResNet models, without deliberately augmenting training data of profile faces. The block is easy to use, light-weight, and can be implemented with a negligible computational overhead. 
### 46.Monocular Depth Estimation using Multi-Scale Continuous CRFs as  Sequential Deep Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00891.pdf)
> Depth cues have been proved very useful in various computer vision and robotic tasks. This paper addresses the problem of monocular depth estimation from a single still image. Inspired by the effectiveness of recent works on multi-scale convolutional neural networks (CNN), we propose a deep model which fuses complementary information derived from multiple CNN side outputs. Different from previous methods using concatenation or weighted average schemes, the integration is obtained by means of continuous Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). In particular, we propose two different variations, one based on a cascade of multiple CRFs, the other on a unified graphical model. By designing a novel CNN implementation of mean-field updates for continuous CRFs, we show that both proposed models can be regarded as sequential deep networks and that training can be performed end-to-end. Through an extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and establish new state of the art results for the monocular depth estimation task on three publicly available datasets, i.e. NYUD-V2, Make3D and KITTI. 
### 47.Multi-Instance Dynamic Ordinal Random Fields for Weakly-supervised  Facial Behavior Analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00907.pdf)
> We propose a Multi-Instance-Learning (MIL) approach for weakly-supervised learning problems, where a training set is formed by bags (sets of feature vectors or instances) and only labels at bag-level are provided. Specifically, we consider the Multi-Instance Dynamic-Ordinal-Regression (MI-DOR) setting, where the instance labels are naturally represented as ordinal variables and bags are structured as temporal sequences. To this end, we propose Multi-Instance Dynamic Ordinal Random Fields (MI-DORF). In this framework, we treat instance-labels as temporally-dependent latent variables in an Undirected Graphical Model. Different MIL assumptions are modelled via newly introduced high-order potentials relating bag and instance-labels within the energy function of the model. We also extend our framework to address the Partially-Observed MI-DOR problems, where a subset of instance labels are available during training. We show on the tasks of weakly-supervised facial behavior analysis, Facial Action Unit (DISFA dataset) and Pain (UNBC dataset) Intensity estimation, that the proposed framework outperforms alternative learning approaches. Furthermore, we show that MIDORF can be employed to reduce the data annotation efforts in this context by large-scale. 
### 48.Protecting JPEG Images Against Adversarial Attacks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00940.pdf)
> As deep neural networks (DNNs) have been integrated into critical systems, several methods to attack these systems have been developed. These adversarial attacks make imperceptible modifications to an image that fool DNN classifiers. We present an adaptive JPEG encoder which defends against many of these attacks. Experimentally, we show that our method produces images with high visual quality while greatly reducing the potency of state-of-the-art attacks. Our algorithm requires only a modest increase in encoding time, produces a compressed image which can be decompressed by an off-the-shelf JPEG decoder, and classified by an unmodified classifier 
### 49.Tree Species Identification from Bark Images Using Convolutional Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00949.pdf)
> Tree species identification using bark images is a challenging problem that could prove useful for many forestry related tasks. However, while the recent progress in deep learning showed impressive results on standard vision problems, a lack of datasets prevented its use on tree bark species classification. In this work, we present, and make publicly available, a novel dataset called BarkNet 1.0 containing more than 23,000 high-resolution bark images from 23 different tree species over a wide range of tree diameters. With it, we demonstrate the feasibility of species recognition through bark images, using deep learning. More specifically, we obtain an accuracy of 93.88% on single crop, and an accuracy of 97.81% using a majority voting approach on all of the images of a tree. We also empirically demonstrate that, for a fixed number of images, it is better to maximize the number of tree individuals in the training database, thus directing future data collection efforts. 
### 50.Multimodal Registration of Retinal Images Using Domain-Specific  Landmarks and Vessel Enhancement [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00951.pdf)
> The analysis of different image modalities is frequently performed in ophthalmology as it provides complementary information for the diagnosis and follow-up of relevant diseases, like hypertension or diabetes. This work presents a hybrid method for the multimodal registration of color fundus retinography and fluorescein angiography. The proposed method combines a feature-based approach, using domain-specific landmarks, with an intensity-based approach that employs a domain-adapted similarity metric. The methodology is tested on a dataset of 59 image pairs containing both healthy and pathological cases. The results show a satisfactory performance of the proposed combined approach in this multimodal scenario, improving the registration accuracy achieved by the feature-based and the intensity-based approaches. 
### 51.Hashing with Mutual Information [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00974.pdf)
> Binary vector embeddings enable fast nearest neighbor retrieval in large databases of high-dimensional objects, and play an important role in many practical applications, such as image and video retrieval. We study the problem of learning binary vector embeddings under a supervised setting, also known as hashing. We propose a novel supervised hashing method based on optimizing an information-theoretic quantity: mutual information. We show that optimizing mutual information can reduce ambiguity in the induced neighborhood structure in the learned Hamming space, which is essential in obtaining high retrieval performance. To this end, we optimize mutual information in deep neural networks with minibatch stochastic gradient descent, with a formulation that maximally and efficiently utilizes available supervision. Experiments on four image retrieval benchmarks, including ImageNet, confirm the effectiveness of our method in learning high-quality binary embeddings for nearest neighbor retrieval. 
### 52.High-Dynamic-Range Imaging for Cloud Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01071.pdf)
> Sky/cloud images obtained from ground-based sky-cameras are usually captured using a fish-eye lens with a wide field of view. However, the sky exhibits a large dynamic range in terms of luminance, more than a conventional camera can capture. It is thus difficult to capture the details of an entire scene with a regular camera in a single shot. In most cases, the circumsolar region is over-exposed, and the regions near the horizon are under-exposed. This renders cloud segmentation for such images difficult. In this paper, we propose HDRCloudSeg -- an effective method for cloud segmentation using High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) imaging based on multi-exposure fusion. We describe the HDR image generation process and release a new database to the community for benchmarking. Our proposed approach is the first using HDR radiance maps for cloud segmentation and achieves very good results. 
### 53.Focal Loss Dense Detector for Vehicle Surveillance [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01114.pdf)
> Deep learning has been widely recognized as a promising approach in different computer vision applications. Specifically, one-stage object detector and two-stage object detector are regarded as the most important two groups of Convolutional Neural Network based object detection methods. One-stage object detector could usually outperform two-stage object detector in speed; However, it normally trails in detection accuracy, compared with two-stage object detectors. In this study, focal loss based RetinaNet, which works as one-stage object detector, is utilized to be able to well match the speed of regular one-stage detectors and also defeat two-stage detectors in accuracy, for vehicle detection. State-of-the-art performance result has been showed on the DETRAC vehicle dataset. 
### 54.Teaching UAVs to Race With Observational Imitation Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01129.pdf)
> Recent work has tackled the problem of autonomous navigation by imitating a teacher and learning an end-to-end policy, which directly predicts controls from raw images. However, these approaches tend to be sensitive to mistakes by the teacher and do not scale well to other environments or vehicles. To this end, we propose a modular network architecture that decouples perception from control, and is trained using Observational Imitation Learning (OIL), a novel imitation learning variant that supports online training and automatic selection of optimal behavior from observing multiple teachers. We apply our proposed methodology to the challenging problem of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) racing. We develop a simulator that enables the generation of large amounts of synthetic training data (both UAV captured images and its controls) and also allows for online learning and evaluation. We train a perception network to predict waypoints from raw image data and a control network to predict UAV controls from these waypoints using OIL. Our modular network is able to autonomously fly a UAV through challenging race tracks at high speeds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained network outperforms its teachers, end-to-end baselines, and even human pilots in simulation.

### 55.Real-Time Deep Learning Method for Abandoned Luggage Detection in Video [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01160.pdf)
> Recent terrorist attacks in major cities around the world have brought many casualties among innocent citizens. One potential threat is represented by abandoned luggage items (that could contain bombs or biological warfare) in public areas. In this paper, we describe an approach for real-time automatic detection of abandoned luggage in video captured by surveillance cameras. The approach is comprised of two stages: (i) static object detection based on background subtraction and motion estimation and (ii) abandoned luggage recognition based on a cascade of convolutional neural networks (CNN). To train our neural networks we provide two types of examples: images collected from the Internet and realistic examples generated by imposing various suitcases and bags over the scene's background. We present empirical results demonstrating that our approach yields better performance than a strong CNN baseline method. 
### 56.The History Began from AlexNet: A Comprehensive Survey on Deep Learning  Approaches [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01164.pdf)
> Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous success in variety of application domains in the past few years. This new field of machine learning has been growing rapidly and applied in most of the application domains with some new modalities of applications, which helps to open new opportunity. There are different methods have been proposed on different category of learning approaches, which includes supervised, semi-supervised and un-supervised learning.

However, those papers have not discussed the individual advanced techniques for training large scale deep learning models and the recently developed method of generative models [1]. 
### 57.Automatic Instrument Segmentation in Robot-Assisted Surgery Using Deep  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01207.pdf)
> Semantic segmentation of robotic instruments is an important problem for the robot-assisted surgery. One of the main challenges is to correctly detect an instrument's position for the tracking and pose estimation in the vicinity of surgical scenes. Accurate pixel-wise instrument segmentation is needed to address this challenge. In this paper we describe our winning solution for MICCAI 2017 Endoscopic Vision SubChallenge: Robotic Instrument Segmentation. Our approach demonstrates an improvement over the state-of-the-art results using several novel deep neural network architectures. It addressed the binary segmentation problem, where every pixel in an image is labeled as an instrument or background from the surgery video feed. In addition, we solve a multi-class segmentation problem, where we distinguish different instruments or different parts of an instrument from the background. In this setting, our approach outperforms other methods in every task subcategory for automatic instrument segmentation thereby providing state-of-the-art solution for this problem. The source code for our solution is made publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/ternaus/robot-surgery-segmentation">this https URL</a> 
### 58.GAN-based Synthetic Medical Image Augmentation for increased CNN  Performance in Liver Lesion Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01229.pdf)
> Deep learning methods, and in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have led to an enormous breakthrough in a wide range of computer vision tasks, primarily by using large-scale annotated datasets. However, obtaining such datasets in the medical domain remains a challenge. In this paper, we present methods for generating synthetic medical images using recently presented deep learning Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Furthermore, we show that generated medical images can be used for synthetic data augmentation, and improve the performance of CNN for medical image classification. Our novel method is demonstrated on a limited dataset of computed tomography (CT) images of 182 liver lesions (53 cysts, 64 metastases and 65 hemangiomas). We first exploit GAN architectures for synthesizing high quality liver lesion ROIs. Then we present a novel scheme for liver lesion classification using CNN. Finally, we train the CNN using classic data augmentation and our synthetic data augmentation and compare performance. In addition, we explore the quality of our synthesized examples using visualization and expert assessment. The classification performance using only classic data augmentation yielded 78.6% sensitivity and 88.4% specificity. By adding the synthetic data augmentation the results increased to 85.7% sensitivity and 92.4% specificity. We believe that this approach to synthetic data augmentation can generalize to other medical classification applications and thus support radiologists' efforts to improve diagnosis. 
### 59.A Benchmark for Iris Location and a Deep Learning Detector Evaluation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01250.pdf)
> The iris is considered as the biometric trait with the highest unique probability. The iris location is an important task for biometrics systems, affecting directly the results obtained in specific applications such as iris recognition, spoofing and contact lenses detection, among others. This work defines the iris location problem as the delimitation of the smallest squared window that encompasses the iris region. In order to build a benchmark for iris location we annotate (iris squared bounding boxes) four databases from different biometric applications and make them publicly available to the community. Besides these 4 annotated databases, we include 2 others from the literature. We perform experiments on these six databases, five obtained with near infra-red sensors and one with visible light sensor. We compare the classical and outstanding Daugman iris location approach with two window based detectors: 1) a sliding window detector based on features from Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and a linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier; 2) a deep learning based detector fine-tuned from YOLO object detector. Experimental results showed that the deep learning based detector outperforms the other ones in terms of accuracy and runtime (GPUs version) and should be chosen whenever possible. 
### 60.Unsupervised Learning of Face Representations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01260.pdf)
> We present an approach for unsupervised training of CNNs in order to learn discriminative face representations. We mine supervised training data by noting that multiple faces in the same video frame must belong to different persons and the same face tracked across multiple frames must belong to the same person. We obtain millions of face pairs from hundreds of videos without using any manual supervision. Although faces extracted from videos have a lower spatial resolution than those which are available as part of standard supervised face datasets such as LFW and CASIA-WebFace, the former represent a much more realistic setting, e.g. in surveillance scenarios where most of the faces detected are very small. We train our CNNs with the relatively low resolution faces extracted from video frames collected, and achieve a higher verification accuracy on the benchmark LFW dataset cf. hand-crafted features such as LBPs, and even surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art deep networks such as VGG-Face, when they are made to work with low resolution input images. 
### 61.Training deep learning based denoisers without ground truth data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01314.pdf)
> Recent deep learning based denoisers often outperform state-of-the-art conventional denoisers such as BM3D. They are typically trained to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the output of a deep neural network and the ground truth image. In deep learning based denoisers, it is important to use high quality noiseless ground truth for high performance, but it is often challenging or even infeasible to obtain such a clean image in application areas such as hyperspectral remote sensing and medical imaging. We propose a Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) based method for training deep neural network denoisers only with noisy images. We demonstrated that our SURE based method without ground truth was able to train deep neural network denoisers to yield performance close to deep learning denoisers trained with ground truth and to outperform state-of-the-art BM3D. Further improvements were achieved by including noisy test images for training denoiser networks using our proposed SURE based method. 
### 62.Classification based Grasp Detection using Spatial Transformer Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01356.pdf)
> Robotic grasp detection task is still challenging, particularly for novel objects. With the recent advance of deep learning, there have been several works on detecting robotic grasp using neural networks. Typically, regression based grasp detection methods have outperformed classification based detection methods in computation complexity with excellent accuracy. However, classification based robotic grasp detection still seems to have merits such as intermediate step observability and straightforward back propagation routine for end-to-end training. In this work, we propose a novel classification based robotic grasp detection method with multiple-stage spatial transformer networks (STN). Our proposed method was able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in accuracy with real- time computation. Additionally, unlike other regression based grasp detection methods, our proposed method allows partial observation for intermediate results such as grasp location and orientation for a number of grasp configuration candidates. 
### 63.Egocentric Basketball Motion Planning from a Single First-Person Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01413.pdf)
> We present a model that uses a single first-person image to generate an egocentric basketball motion sequence in the form of a 12D camera configuration trajectory, which encodes a player's 3D location and 3D head orientation throughout the sequence. To do this, we first introduce a future convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts an initial sequence of 12D camera configurations, aiming to capture how real players move during a one-on-one basketball game. We also introduce a goal verifier network, which is trained to verify that a given camera configuration is consistent with the final goals of real one-on-one basketball players. Next, we propose an inverse synthesis procedure to synthesize a refined sequence of 12D camera configurations that (1) sufficiently matches the initial configurations predicted by the future CNN, while (2) maximizing the output of the goal verifier network. Finally, by following the trajectory resulting from the refined camera configuration sequence, we obtain the complete 12D motion sequence. <br />Our model generates realistic basketball motion sequences that capture the goals of real players, outperforming standard deep learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). 
### 64.Efficient and Accurate MRI Super-Resolution using a Generative  Adversarial Network and 3D Multi-Level Densely Connected Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01417.pdf)
> High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance images (MRI) provide detailed anatomical information important for clinical application and quantitative image analysis. However, HR MRI conventionally comes at the cost of longer scan time, smaller spatial coverage, and lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recent studies have shown that single image super-resolution (SISR), a technique to recover HR details from one single low-resolution (LR) input image, could provide high-quality image details with the help of advanced deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, deep neural networks consume memory heavily and run slowly, especially in 3D settings. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D neural network design, namely a multi-level densely connected super-resolution network (mDCSRN) with generative adversarial network (GAN)-guided training. The mDCSRN quickly trains and inferences and the GAN promotes realistic output hardly distinguishable from original HR images. Our results from experiments on a dataset with 1,113 subjects show that our new architecture beats other popular deep learning methods in recovering 4x resolution-downgraded im-ages and runs 6x faster. 
### 65.Less Is More: Picking Informative Frames for Video Captioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01457.pdf)
> In video captioning task, the best practice has been achieved by attention-based models which associate salient visual components with sentences in the video. However, existing study follows a common procedure which includes a frame-level appearance modeling and motion modeling on equal interval frame sampling, which may bring about redundant visual information, sensitivity to content noise and unnecessary computation cost. <br />We propose a plug-and-play PickNet to perform informative frame picking in video captioning. Based on a standard Encoder-Decoder framework, we develop a reinforcement-learning-based procedure to train the network sequentially, where the reward of each frame picking action is designed by maximizing visual diversity and minimizing textual discrepancy. If the candidate is rewarded, it will be selected and the corresponding latent representation of Encoder-Decoder will be updated for future trials. This procedure goes on until the end of the video sequence. Consequently, a compact frame subset can be selected to represent the visual information and perform video captioning without performance degradation. Experiment results shows that our model can use 6-8 frames to achieve competitive performance across popular benchmarks. 
### 66.Totally Looks Like - How Humans Compare, Compared to Machines [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01485.pdf)
> Perceptual judgment of image similarity by humans relies on rich internal representations ranging from low-level features to high-level concepts, scene properties and even cultural associations. However, existing methods and datasets attempting to explain perceived similarity use stimuli which arguably do not cover the full breadth of factors that affect human similarity judgments, even those geared toward this goal. We introduce a new dataset dubbed \textbf{Totally-Looks-Like} (TLL) after a popular entertainment website, which contains images paired by humans as being visually similar. The dataset contains 6016 image-pairs from the wild, shedding light upon a rich and diverse set of criteria employed by human beings. We conduct experiments to try to reproduce the pairings via features extracted from state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks, as well as additional human experiments to verify the consistency of the collected data. Though we create conditions to artificially make the matching task increasingly easier, we show that machine-extracted representations perform very poorly in terms of reproducing the matching selected by humans. We discuss and analyze these results, suggesting future directions for improvement of learned image representations. 
### 67.Cross-Paced Representation Learning with Partial Curricula for  Sketch-based Image Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01504.pdf)
> In this paper we address the problem of learning robust cross-domain representations for sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR). While most SBIR approaches focus on extracting low- and mid-level descriptors for direct feature matching, recent works have shown the benefit of learning coupled feature representations to describe data from two related sources. However, cross-domain representation learning methods are typically cast into non-convex minimization problems that are difficult to optimize, leading to unsatisfactory performance. Inspired by self-paced learning, a learning methodology designed to overcome convergence issues related to local optima by exploiting the samples in a meaningful order (i.e. easy to hard), we introduce the cross-paced partial curriculum learning (CPPCL) framework. Compared with existing self-paced learning methods which only consider a single modality and cannot deal with prior knowledge, CPPCL is specifically designed to assess the learning pace by jointly handling data from dual sources and modality-specific prior information provided in the form of partial curricula. Additionally, thanks to the learned dictionaries, we demonstrate that the proposed CPPCL embeds robust coupled representations for SBIR. Our approach is extensively evaluated on four publicly available datasets (i.e. CUFS, Flickr15K, QueenMary SBIR and TU-Berlin Extension datasets), showing superior performance over competing SBIR methods. 
### 68.A new stereo formulation not using pixel and disparity models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01516.pdf)
> We introduce a new stereo formulation which does not use pixel and disparity models. Many problems in vision are treated as assigning each pixel a label. Disparities are labels for stereo. Such pixel-labeling problems are naturally represented in terms of energy minimization, where the energy function has two terms: one term penalizes solutions that inconsistent with the observed data, the other term enforces spatial smoothness. Graph cuts are one of the effi- cient methods for solving energy minimization. However, exact minimization of multi labeling problems can be performed by graph cuts only for the case with convex smoothness terms. In pixel-disparity formulation, convex smoothness terms do not generate well reconstructed 3D results. Thus, truncated linear or quadratic smoothness terms, etc. are used, where approximate energy minimization is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a new site-labeling formulation, where the sites are not pixels but lines in 3D space, labels are not disparities but depth numbers. For this formulation, visibility reasoning is naturally included in the energy function. In addition, this formulation allows us to use a small smoothness term, which does not affect the 3D results much. This makes the optimization step very simple, so we could develop an approximation method for graph cut itself (not for energy minimization) and a high performance GPU graph cut program. For Tsukuba stereo pair in Middlebury data set, we got the result in 5ms using GTX1080GPU, 19ms using GTX660GPU. 
### 69.LSTD: A Low-Shot Transfer Detector for Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01529.pdf)
> Recent advances in object detection are mainly driven by deep learning with large-scale detection benchmarks. However, the fully-annotated training set is often limited for a target detection task, which may deteriorate the performance of deep detectors. To address this challenge, we propose a novel low-shot transfer detector (LSTD) in this paper, where we leverage rich source-domain knowledge to construct an effective target-domain detector with very few training examples. The main contributions are described as follows. First, we design a flexible deep architecture of LSTD to alleviate transfer difficulties in low-shot detection. This architecture can integrate the advantages of both SSD and Faster RCNN in a unified deep framework. Second, we introduce a novel regularized transfer learning framework for low-shot detection, where the transfer knowledge (TK) and background depression (BD) regularizations are proposed to leverage object knowledge respectively from source and target domains, in order to further enhance fine-tuning with a few target images. Finally, we examine our LSTD on a number of challenging low-shot detection experiments, where LSTD outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. The results demonstrate that LSTD is a preferable deep detector for low-shot scenarios. 
### 70.Learning-Based Dequantization For Image Restoration Against Extremely  Poor Illumination [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01532.pdf)
> All existing image enhancement methods, such as HDR tone mapping, cannot recover A/D quantization losses due to insufficient or excessive lighting, (underflow and overflow problems). The loss of image details due to A/D quantization is complete and it cannot be recovered by traditional image processing methods, but the modern data-driven machine learning approach offers a much needed cure to the problem. In this work we propose a novel approach to restore and enhance images acquired in low and uneven lighting. First, the ill illumination is algorithmically compensated by emulating the effects of artificial supplementary lighting. Then a DCNN trained using only synthetic data recovers the missing detail caused by quantization. 
### 71.Path Aggregation Network for Instance Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01534.pdf)
> The way that information propagates in neural networks is of great importance. In this paper, we propose Path Aggregation Network (PANet) aiming at boosting information flow in proposal-based instance segmentation framework. Specifically, we enhance the entire feature hierarchy with accurate localization signals in lower layers by bottom-up path augmentation, which shortens the information path between lower layers and topmost feature. We present adaptive feature pooling, which links feature grid and all feature levels to make useful information in each feature level propagate directly to following proposal subnetworks. A complementary branch capturing different views for each proposal is created to further improve mask prediction. These improvements are simple to implement, with subtle extra computational overhead. Our PANet reaches the 1st place in the COCO 2017 Challenge Instance Segmentation task and the 2nd place in Object Detection task without large-batch training. It is also state-of-the-art on MVD and Cityscapes. Code is available at <a href="https://github.com/ShuLiu1993/PANet.">this https URL</a> 
### 72.Improving the Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs: A Consistency Term  and Its Dual Effect [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01541.pdf)
> Despite being impactful on a variety of problems and applications, the generative adversarial nets (GANs) are remarkably difficult to train. This issue is formally analyzed by \cite{arjovsky2017towards}, who also propose an alternative direction to avoid the caveats in the minmax two-player training of GANs. The corresponding algorithm, called Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), hinges on the 1-Lipschitz continuity of the discriminator. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enforcing the Lipschitz continuity in the training procedure of WGANs. Our approach seamlessly connects WGAN with one of the recent semi-supervised learning methods. As a result, it gives rise to not only better photo-realistic samples than the previous methods but also state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning results. In particular, our approach gives rise to the inception score of more than 5.0 with only 1,000 CIFAR-10 images and is the first that exceeds the accuracy of 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset using only 4,000 labeled images, to the best of our knowledge. 
### 73.Relocalization, Global Optimization and Map Merging for Monocular  Visual-Inertial SLAM [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01549.pdf)
> The monocular visual-inertial system (VINS), which consists one camera and one low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU), is a popular approach to achieve accurate 6-DOF state estimation. However, such locally accurate visual-inertial odometry is prone to drift and cannot provide absolute pose estimation. Leveraging history information to relocalize and correct drift has become a hot topic. In this paper, we propose a monocular visual-inertial SLAM system, which can relocalize camera and get the absolute pose in a previous-built map. Then 4-DOF pose graph optimization is performed to correct drifts and achieve global consistent. The 4-DOF contains x, y, z, and yaw angle, which is the actual drifted direction in the visual-inertial system. Furthermore, the proposed system can reuse a map by saving and loading it in an efficient way. Current map and previous map can be merged together by the global pose graph optimization. We validate the accuracy of our system on public datasets and compare against other state-of-the-art algorithms. We also evaluate the map merging ability of our system in the large-scale outdoor environment. The source code of map reuse is integrated into our public code, VINS-Mono. 
### 74.Beyond Context: Exploring Semantic Similarity for Tiny Face Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01555.pdf)
> Tiny face detection aims to find faces with high degrees of variability in scale, resolution and occlusion in cluttered scenes. Due to the very little information available on tiny faces, it is not sufficient to detect them merely based on the information presented inside the tiny bounding boxes or their context. In this paper, we propose to exploit the semantic similarity among all predicted targets in each image to boost current face detectors. To this end, we present a novel framework to model semantic similarity as pairwise constraints within the metric learning scheme, and then refine our predictions with the semantic similarity by utilizing the graph cut techniques. Experiments conducted on three widely-used benchmark datasets have demonstrated the improvement over the-state-of-the-arts gained by applying this idea. 
### 75.Local Distance Metric Learning for Nearest Neighbor Algorithm [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01562.pdf)
> Distance metric learning is a successful way to enhance the performance of the nearest neighbor classifier. In most cases, however, the distribution of data does not obey a regular form and may change in different parts of the feature space. Regarding that, this paper proposes a novel local distance metric learning method, namely Local Mahalanobis Distance Learning (LMDL), in order to enhance the performance of the nearest neighbor classifier. LMDL considers the neighborhood influence and learns multiple distance metrics for a reduced set of input samples. The reduced set is called as prototypes which try to preserve local discriminative information as much as possible. The proposed LMDL can be kernelized very easily, which is significantly desirable in the case of highly nonlinear data. The quality as well as the efficiency of the proposed method assesses through a set of different experiments on various datasets and the obtained results show that LDML as well as the kernelized version is superior to the other related state-of-the-art methods. 
### 76.Predicting Out-of-View Feature Points for Model-Based Camera Pose  Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01577.pdf)
> In this work we present a novel framework that uses deep learning to predict object feature points that are out-of-view in the input image. This system was developed with the application of model-based tracking in mind, particularly in the case of autonomous inspection robots, where only partial views of the object are available. Out-of-view prediction is enabled by applying scaling to the feature point labels during network training. This is combined with a recurrent neural network architecture designed to provide the final prediction layers with rich feature information from across the spatial extent of the input image. To show the versatility of these out-of-view predictions, we describe how to integrate them in both a particle filter tracker and an optimisation based tracker. To evaluate our work we compared our framework with one that predicts only points inside the image. We show that as the amount of the object in view decreases, being able to predict outside the image bounds adds robustness to the final pose estimation. 
### 77.Spectral reflectance estimation from one RGB image using  self-interreflections in a concave object [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01595.pdf)
> Light interreflections occurring in a concave object generate a color gradient which is characteristic of the object's spectral reflectance. In this paper, we use this property in order to estimate the spectral reflectance of matte, uniformly colored, V-shaped surfaces from a single RGB image taken under directional lighting. First, simulations show that using one image of the concave object is equivalent to, and can even outperform, the state of the art approaches based on three images taken under three lightings with different colors. Experiments on real images of folded papers were performed under unmeasured direct sunlight. The results show that our interreflection-based approach outperforms existing approaches even when the latter are improved by a calibration step. The mathematical solution for the interreflection equation and the effect of surface parameters on the performance of the method are also discussed in this paper. 
### 78.AdaDepth: Unsupervised Content Congruent Adaptation for Depth Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01599.pdf)
> Supervised deep learning methods have shown promising results for the task of monocular depth estimation; but acquiring ground truth is costly, and prone to noise as well as inaccuracies. While synthetic datasets have been used to circumvent above problems, the resultant models do not generalize well to natural scenes due to the inherent domain shift. Recent adversarial approaches for domain adaption have performed well in mitigating the differences between the source and target domains. But these methods are mostly limited to a classification setup and do not scale well for fully-convolutional architectures. In this work, we propose AdaDepth - an unsupervised domain adaptation strategy for the pixel-wise regression task of monocular depth estimation. The proposed approach is devoid of above limitations through a) adversarial learning and b) explicit imposition of content consistency on the adapted target representation. Our unsupervised approach performs competitively with other established approaches on depth estimation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results in a semi-supervised setting. 
### 79.Affine Differential Invariants for Invariant Feature Point Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01669.pdf)
> Image feature points are detected as pixels which locally maximize a detector function, two commonly used examples of which are the (Euclidean) image gradient and the Harris-Stephens corner detector. A major limitation of these feature detectors are that they are only Euclidean-invariant. In this work we demonstrate the application of a 2D affine-invariant image feature point detector based on differential invariants as derived through the equivariant method of moving frames. The fundamental equi-affine differential invariants for 3D image volumes are also computed. 
### 80.ViS-HuD: Using Visual Saliency to Improve Human Detection with  Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01687.pdf)
> The paper presents a technique to improve human detection in still images using deep learning. Our novel method, ViS-HuD, computes visual saliency map from the image. Then the input image is multiplied by the map and product is fed to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which detects humans in the image. A visual saliency map is generated using ML-Net and human detection is carried out using DetectNet. ML-Net is pre-trained on SALICON while, DetectNet is pre-trained on ImageNet database for visual saliency detection and image classification respectively. The CNNs of ViS-HuD were trained on two challenging databases - Penn Fudan and TUD-Brussels Benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Penn Fudan Dataset with 91.4% human detection accuracy and it achieves average miss-rate of 53% on the TUDBrussels benchmark. 
### 81.Resampling Forgery Detection Using Deep Learning and A-Contrario  Analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01711.pdf)
> The amount of digital imagery recorded has recently grown exponentially, and with the advancement of software, such as Photoshop or Gimp, it has become easier to manipulate images. However, most images on the internet have not been manipulated and any automated manipulation detection algorithm must carefully control the false alarm rate. In this paper we discuss a method to automatically detect local resampling using deep learning while controlling the false alarm rate using a-contrario analysis. The automated procedure consists of three primary steps. First, resampling features are calculated for image blocks. A deep learning classifier is then used to generate a heatmap that indicates if the image block has been resampled. We expect some of these blocks to be falsely identified as resampled. We use a-contrario hypothesis testing to both identify if the patterns of the manipulated blocks indicate if the image has been tampered with and to localize the manipulation. We demonstrate that this strategy is effective in indicating if an image has been manipulated and localizing the manipulations. 
### 82.A generalized parametric 3D shape representation for articulated pose  estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01780.pdf)
> We present a novel parametric 3D shape representation, Generalized sum of Gaussians (G-SoG), which is particularly suitable for pose estimation of articulated objects. Compared with the original sum-of-Gaussians (SoG), G-SoG can handle both isotropic and anisotropic Gaussians, leading to a more flexible and adaptable shape representation yet with much fewer anisotropic Gaussians involved. An articulated shape template can be developed by embedding G-SoG in a tree-structured skeleton model to represent an articulated object. We further derive a differentiable similarity function between G-SoG (the template) and SoG (observed data) that can be optimized analytically for efficient pose estimation. The experimental results on a standard human pose estimation dataset show the effectiveness and advantages of G-SoG over the original SoG as well as the promise compared with the recent algorithms that use more complicated shape models. 
### 83.ST-GAN: Spatial Transformer Generative Adversarial Networks for Image  Compositing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01837.pdf)
> We address the problem of finding realistic geometric corrections to a foreground object such that it appears natural when composited into a background image. To achieve this, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that utilizes Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) as the generator, which we call Spatial Transformer GANs (ST-GANs). ST-GANs seek image realism by operating in the geometric warp parameter space. In particular, we exploit an iterative STN warping scheme and propose a sequential training strategy that achieves better results compared to naive training of a single generator. One of the key advantages of ST-GAN is its applicability to high-resolution images indirectly since the predicted warp parameters are transferable between reference frames. We demonstrate our approach in two applications: (1) visualizing how indoor furniture (e.g. from product images) might be perceived in a room, (2) hallucinating how accessories like glasses would look when matched with real portraits. 
### 84.Abnormality Detection in Mammography using Deep Convolutional Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01906.pdf)
> Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. The most common screening technology is mammography. To reduce the cost and workload of radiologists, we propose a computer aided detection approach for classifying and localizing calcifications and masses in mammogram images. To improve on conventional approaches, we apply deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for automatic feature learning and classifier building. In computer-aided mammography, deep CNN classifiers cannot be trained directly on full mammogram images because of the loss of image details from resizing at input layers. Instead, our classifiers are trained on labelled image patches and then adapted to work on full mammogram images for localizing the abnormalities. State-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks are compared on their performance of classifying the abnormalities. Experimental results indicate that VGGNet receives the best overall accuracy at 92.53\% in classifications. For localizing abnormalities, ResNet is selected for computing class activation maps because it is ready to be deployed without structural change or further training. Our approach demonstrates that deep convolutional neural network classifiers have remarkable localization capabilities despite no supervision on the location of abnormalities is provided. 
### 85.M3Fusion: A Deep Learning Architecture for Multi-{Scale/Modal/Temporal}  satellite data fusion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01945.pdf)
> Modern Earth Observation systems provide sensing data at different temporal and spatial resolutions. Among optical sensors, today the Sentinel-2 program supplies high-resolution temporal (every 5 days) and high spatial resolution (10m) images that can be useful to monitor land cover dynamics. On the other hand, Very High Spatial Resolution images (VHSR) are still an essential tool to figure out land cover mapping characterized by fine spatial patterns. Understand how to efficiently leverage these complementary sources of information together to deal with land cover mapping is still challenging. With the aim to tackle land cover mapping through the fusion of multi-temporal High Spatial Resolution and Very High Spatial Resolution satellite images, we propose an End-to-End Deep Learning framework, named M3Fusion, able to leverage simultaneously the temporal knowledge contained in time series data as well as the fine spatial information available in VHSR information. Experiments carried out on the Reunion Island study area asses the quality of our proposal considering both quantitative and qualitative aspects. 
### 86.Segmentation of Drosophila Heart in Optical Coherence Microscopy Images  Using Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01947.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks are powerful tools for image segmentation and classification. Here, we use this method to identify and mark the heart region of Drosophila at different developmental stages in the cross-sectional images acquired by a custom optical coherence microscopy (OCM) system. With our well-trained convolutional neural network model, the heart regions through multiple heartbeat cycles can be marked with an intersection over union (IOU) of ~86%. Various morphological and dynamical cardiac parameters can be quantified accurately with automatically segmented heart regions. This study demonstrates an efficient heart segmentation method to analyze OCM images of the beating heart in Drosophila. 
### 87.Learning Scene Gist with Convolutional Neural Networks to Improve Object  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01967.pdf)
> Advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant strides toward achieving high performance levels on multiple object recognition tasks. While some approaches utilize information from the entire scene to propose regions of interest, the task of interpreting a particular region or object is still performed independently of other objects and features in the image. Here we demonstrate that a scene's 'gist' can significantly contribute to how well humans can recognize objects. These findings are consistent with the notion that humans foveate on an object and incorporate information from the periphery to aid in recognition. We use a biologically inspired two-part convolutional neural network ('GistNet') that models the fovea and periphery to provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that computational object recognition can significantly benefit from the gist of the scene as contextual information. Our model yields accuracy improvements of up to 50% in certain object categories when incorporating contextual gist, while only increasing the original model size by 5%. This proposed model mirrors our intuition about how the human visual system recognizes objects, suggesting specific biologically plausible constraints to improve machine vision and building initial steps towards the challenge of scene understanding. 
### 88.MIS-SLAM: Real-time Large Scale Dense Deformable SLAM System in Minimal  Invasive Surgery Based on Heterogeneous Computing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02009.pdf)
> Real-time simultaneously localization and dense mapping is very helpful for providing Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality for surgeons or even surgical robots. In this paper, we propose MIS-SLAM: a complete real-time large scale dense deformable SLAM system with stereoscope in Minimal Invasive Surgery based on heterogeneous computing by making full use of CPU and GPU. Idled CPU is used to perform ORB- SLAM for providing robust global pose. Strategies are taken to integrate modules from CPU and GPU. We solved the key problem raised in previous work, that is, fast movement of scope and blurry images make the scope tracking fail. Benefiting from improved localization, MIS-SLAM can achieve large scale scope localizing and dense mapping in real-time. It transforms and deforms current model and incrementally fuses new observation while keeping vivid texture. In-vivo experiments conducted on publicly available datasets presented in the form of videos demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of MIS-SLAM for potential clinical purpose. 
### 89.The Contextual Loss for Image Transformation with Non-Aligned Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02077.pdf)
> Feed-forward CNNs trained for image transformation problems rely on loss functions that measure the similarity between the generated image and a target image. Most of the common loss functions assume that these images are spatially aligned and compare pixels at corresponding locations. However, for many tasks, aligned training pairs of images will not be available. We present an alternative loss function that does not require alignment, thus providing an effective and simple solution for a new space of problems. Our loss is based on both context and semantics -- it compares regions with similar semantic meaning, while considering the context of the entire image. Hence, for example, when transferring the style of one face to another, it will translate eyes-to-eyes and mouth-to-mouth. Our code can be found at <a href="https://www.github.com/roimehrez/contextualLoss">this https URL</a> 
### 90.A Non-Technical Survey on Deep Convolutional Neural Network  Architectures [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02129.pdf)
> Artificial neural networks have recently shown great results in many disciplines and a variety of applications, including natural language understanding, speech processing, games and image data generation. One particular application in which the strong performance of artificial neural networks was demonstrated is the recognition of objects in images, where deep convolutional neural networks are commonly applied. In this survey, we give a comprehensive introduction to this topic (object recognition with deep convolutional neural networks), with a strong focus on the evolution of network architectures. Therefore, we aim to compress the most important concepts in this field in a simple and non-technical manner to allow for future researchers to have a quick general understanding. <br />This work is structured as follows: <br />1. We will explain the basic ideas of (convolutional) neural networks and deep learning and examine their usage for three object recognition tasks: image classification, object localization and object detection. <br />2. We give a review on the evolution of deep convolutional neural networks by providing an extensive overview of the most important network architectures presented in chronological order of their appearances. 
### 91.Conceptualization of Object Compositions Using Persistent Homology [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02140.pdf)
> A topological shape analysis is proposed and utilized to learn concepts that reflect shape commonalities. Our approach is two-fold: i) a spatial topology analysis of point cloud segment constellations within objects. Therein constellations are decomposed and described in an hierarchical manner - from single segments to segment groups until a single group reflects an entire object. ii) a topology analysis of the description space in which segment decompositions are exposed in. Inspired by Persistent Homology, hidden groups of shape commonalities are revealed from object segment decompositions. Experiments show that extracted persistent groups of commonalities can represent semantically meaningful shape concepts. We also show the generalization capability of the proposed approach considering samples of external datasets. 
### 92.2^B3^C: 2 Box 3 Crop of Facial Image for Gender Classification with  Convolutional Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02181.pdf)
> In this paper, we tackle the classification of gender in facial images with deep learning. Our convolutional neural networks (CNN) use the VGG-16 architecture [1] and are pretrained on ImageNet for image classification. Our proposed method (2^B3^C) first detects the face in the facial image, increases the margin of a detected face by 50%, cropping the face with two boxes three crop schemes (Left, Middle, and Right crop) and extracts the CNN predictions on the cropped schemes. The CNNs of our method is fine-tuned on the Adience and LFW with gender annotations. We show the effectiveness of our method by achieving 90.8% classification on Adience and achieving competitive 95.3% classification accuracy on LFW dataset. In addition, to check the true ability of our method, our gender classification system has a frame rate of 7-10 fps (frames per seconds) on a GPU considering real-time scenarios. 
### 93.DenseReg: Fully Convolutional Dense Shape Regression In-the-Wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02188.pdf)
> In this work we use deep learning to establish dense correspondences between a 3D object model and an image "in the wild". We introduce "DenseReg", a fully-convolutional neural network (F-CNN) that densely regresses at every foreground pixel a pair of U-V template coordinates in a single feedforward pass. To train DenseReg we construct a supervision signal by combining 3D deformable model fitting and 2D landmark annotations. We define the regression task in terms of the intrinsic, U-V coordinates of a 3D deformable model that is brought into correspondence with image instances at training time. A host of other object-related tasks (e.g. part segmentation, landmark localization) are shown to be by-products of this task, and to largely improve thanks to its introduction. We obtain highly-accurate regression results by combining ideas from semantic segmentation with regression networks, yielding a 'quantized regression' architecture that first obtains a quantized estimate of position through classification, and refines it through regression of the residual. We show that such networks can boost the performance of existing state-of-the-art systems for pose estimation. Firstly, we show that our system can serve as an initialization for Statistical Deformable Models, as well as an element of cascaded architectures that jointly localize landmarks and estimate dense correspondences. We also show that the obtained dense correspondence can act as a source of 'privileged information' that complements and extends the pure landmark-level annotations, accelerating and improving the training of pose estimation networks. We report state-of-the-art performance on the challenging 300W benchmark for facial landmark localization and on the MPII and LSP datasets for human pose estimation. 
### 94.Early Start Intention Detection of Cyclists Using Motion History Images  and a Deep Residual Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02242.pdf)
> In this article, we present a novel approach to detect starting motions of cyclists in real world traffic scenarios based on Motion History Images (MHIs). The method uses a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a residual network architecture (ResNet), which is commonly used in image classification and detection tasks. By combining MHIs with a ResNet classifier and performing a frame by frame classification of the MHIs, we are able to detect starting motions in image sequences. The detection is performed using a wide angle stereo camera system at an urban intersection. We compare our algorithm to an existing method to detect movement transitions of pedestrians that uses MHIs in combination with a Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) like descriptor and a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we adapted to cyclists. To train and evaluate the methods a dataset containing MHIs of 394 cyclist starting motions was created. The results show that both methods can be used to detect starting motions of cyclists. Using the SVM approach, we were able to safely detect starting motions 0.506 s on average after the bicycle starts moving with an F1-score of 97.7%. The ResNet approach achieved an F1-score of 100% at an average detection time of 0.144 s. The ResNet approach outperformed the SVM approach in both robustness against false positive detections and detection time. 
### 95.Depth Information Guided Crowd Counting for Complex Crowd Scenes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02256.pdf)
> It is important to monitor and analyze crowd events for the sake of city safety. In an EDOF (extended depth of field) image with a crowded scene, the distribution of people is highly imbalanced. People far away from the camera look much smaller and often occlude each other heavily, while people close to the camera look larger. In such a case, it is difficult to accurately estimate the number of people by using one technique. In this paper, we propose a Depth Information Guided Crowd Counting (DigCrowd) method to deal with crowded EDOF scenes. DigCrowd first uses the depth information of an image to segment the scene into a far-view region and a near-view region. Then Digcrowd maps the far-view region to its crowd density map and uses a detection method to count the people in the near-view region. In addition, we introduce a new crowd dataset that contains 1000 images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DigCrowd method 
### 96.Methodology to analyze the accuracy of 3D objects reconstructed with  collaborative robot based monocular LSD-SLAM [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02257.pdf)
> SLAM systems are mainly applied for robot navigation while research on feasibility for motion planning with SLAM for tasks like bin-picking, is scarce. Accurate 3D reconstruction of objects and environments is important for planning motion and computing optimal gripper pose to grasp objects. In this work, we propose the methods to analyze the accuracy of a 3D environment reconstructed using a LSD-SLAM system with a monocular camera mounted onto the gripper of a collaborative robot. We discuss and propose a solution to the pose space conversion problem. Finally, we present several criteria to analyze the 3D reconstruction accuracy. These could be used as guidelines to improve the accuracy of 3D reconstructions with monocular LSD-SLAM and other SLAM based solutions. 
### 97.ExpandNet: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for High Dynamic Range  Expansion from Low Dynamic Range Content [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02266.pdf)
> High dynamic range (HDR) imaging provides the capability of handling real world lighting as opposed to the traditional low dynamic range (LDR) which struggles to accurately represent images with higher dynamic range. However, most imaging content is still available only in LDR. This paper presents a method for generating HDR content from LDR content based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) termed ExpandNet. ExpandNet accepts LDR images as input and generates images with an expanded range in an end-to-end fashion. The model attempts to reconstruct missing information that was lost from the original signal due to quantization, clipping, tone mapping or gamma correction. The added information is reconstructed from learned features, as the network is trained in a supervised fashion using a dataset of HDR images. The approach is fully automatic and data driven; it does not require any heuristics or human expertise. ExpandNet uses a multiscale architecture which avoids the use of upsampling layers to improve image quality. The method performs well compared to expansion/inverse tone mapping operators quantitatively on multiple metrics, even for badly exposed inputs. 
### 98.Personalized Exposure Control Using Adaptive Metering and Reinforcement  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02269.pdf)
> We propose a reinforcement learning approach for real-time exposure control of a mobile camera that is personalizable. Our approach is based on Markov Decision Process (MDP). In the camera viewfinder or live preview mode, given the current frame, our system predicts the change in exposure so as to optimize the trade-off among image quality, fast convergence, and minimal temporal oscillation. We model the exposure prediction function as a fully convolutional neural network that can be trained through Gaussian policy gradient in an end-to-end fashion. As a result, our system can associate scene semantics with exposure values; it can also be extended to personalize the exposure adjustments for a user and device. We improve the learning performance by incorporating an adaptive metering module that links semantics with exposure. This adaptive metering module generalizes the conventional spot or matrix metering techniques. We validate our system using the MIT FiveK and our own datasets captured using iPhone 7 and Google Pixel. Experimental results show that our system exhibits stable real-time behavior while improving visual quality compared to what is achieved through native camera control. 
### 99.GeoNet: Unsupervised Learning of Dense Depth, Optical Flow and Camera  Pose [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02276.pdf)
> We propose GeoNet, a jointly unsupervised learning framework for monocular depth, optical flow and ego-motion estimation from videos. The three components are coupled by the nature of 3D scene geometry, jointly learned by our framework in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, geometric relationships are extracted over the predictions of individual modules and then combined as an image reconstruction loss, reasoning about static and dynamic scene parts separately. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive geometric consistency loss to increase robustness towards outliers and non-Lambertian regions, which resolves occlusions and texture ambiguities effectively. Experimentation on the KITTI driving dataset reveals that our scheme achieves state-of-the-art results in all of the three tasks, performing better than previously unsupervised methods and comparably with supervised ones. 
### 100.Zero-Shot Sketch-Image Hashing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02284.pdf)
> Recent studies show that large-scale sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) can be efficiently tackled by cross-modal binary representation learning methods, where Hamming distance matching significantly speeds up the process of similarity search. Providing training and test data subjected to a fixed set of pre-defined categories, the cutting-edge SBIR and cross-modal hashing works obtain acceptable retrieval performance. However, most of the existing methods fail when the categories of query sketches have never been seen during training. In this paper, the above problem is briefed as a novel but realistic zero-shot SBIR hashing task. We elaborate the challenges of this special task and accordingly propose a zero-shot sketch-image hashing (ZSIH) model. An end-to-end three-network architecture is built, two of which are treated as the binary encoders. The third network mitigates the sketch-image heterogeneity and enhances the semantic relations among data by utilizing the Kronecker fusion layer and graph convolution, respectively. As an important part of ZSIH, we formulate a generative hashing scheme in reconstructing semantic knowledge representations for zero-shot retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, ZSIH is the first zero-shot hashing work suitable for SBIR and cross-modal search. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two extended datasets, i.e., Sketchy and TU-Berlin with a novel zero-shot train-test split. The proposed model remarkably outperforms related works. 
### 101.Hybrid Multi-camera Visual Servoing to Moving Target [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02285.pdf)
> Visual servoing is a well-known task in robotics. However, there are still challenges when multiple visual sources are combined to accurately guide the robot or occlusions appear. In this paper we present a novel visual servoing approach using hybrid multi-camera input data to lead a robot arm accurately to dynamically moving target points in the presence of partial occlusions. The approach uses four RGBD sensors as Eye-to-Hand (EtoH) visual input, and an arm-mounted stereo camera as Eye-in-Hand (EinH). A Master supervisor task selects between using the EtoH or the EinH, depending on the distance between the robot and target. The Master also selects the subset of EtoH cameras that best perceive the target. When the EinH sensor is used, if the target becomes occluded or goes out of the sensor's view-frustum, the Master switches back to the EtoH sensors to re-track the object. Using this adaptive visual input data, the robot is then controlled using an iterative planner that uses position, orientation and joint configuration to estimate the trajectory. Since the target is dynamic, this trajectory is updated every time-step. Experiments show good performance in four different situations: tracking a ball, targeting a bulls-eye, guiding a straw to a mouth and delivering an item to a moving hand. The experiments cover both simple situations such as a ball that is mostly visible from all cameras, and more complex situations such as the mouth which is partially occluded from some of the sensors. 
### 102.Deep Thermal Imaging: Proximate Material Type Recognition in the Wild  through Deep Learning of Spatial Surface Temperature Patterns [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02310.pdf)
> We introduce Deep Thermal Imaging, a new approach for close-range automatic recognition of materials to enhance the understanding of people and ubiquitous technologies of their proximal environment. Our approach uses a low-cost mobile thermal camera integrated into a smartphone to capture thermal textures. A deep neural network classifies these textures into material types. This approach works effectively without the need for ambient light sources or direct contact with materials. Furthermore, the use of a deep learning network removes the need to handcraft the set of features for different materials. We evaluated the performance of the system by training it to recognise 32 material types in both indoor and outdoor environments. Our approach produced recognition accuracies above 98% in 14,860 images of 15 indoor materials and above 89% in 26,584 images of 17 outdoor materials. We conclude by discussing its potentials for real-time use in HCI applications and future directions. 
### 103.Comparison of Deep Learning Approaches for Multi-Label Chest X-Ray  Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02315.pdf)
> The increased availability of X-ray image archives (e.g. the ChestX-ray14 dataset from the NIH Clinical Center) has triggered a growing interest in deep learning techniques. To provide better insight into the different approaches, and their applications to chest X-ray classification, we investigate a powerful network architecture in detail: the ResNet-50. Building on prior work in this domain, we consider transfer learning with and without fine-tuning as well as the training of a dedicated X-ray network from scratch. To leverage the high spatial resolutions of X-ray data, we also include an extended ResNet-50 architecture, and a network integrating non-image data (patient age, gender and acquisition type) in the classification process. In a systematic evaluation, using 5-fold re-sampling and a multi-label loss function, we evaluate the performance of the different approaches for pathology classification by ROC statistics and analyze differences between the classifiers using rank correlation. We observe a considerable spread in the achieved performance and conclude that the X-ray-specific ResNet-50, integrating non-image data yields the best overall results. 
### 104.Comparison of various image fusion methods for impervious surface  classification from VNREDSat-1 [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02326.pdf)
> Impervious surface is an important indicator for urban development monitoring. Accurate urban impervious surfaces mapping with VNREDSat-1 remains challenging due to their spectral diversity not captured by individual PAN image. In this artical, five multi-resolution image fusion techniques were compared for classification task of urban impervious surface. The result shows that for VNREDSat-1 dataset, UNB and Wavelet tranform methods are the best techniques reserving spatial and spectral information of original MS image, respectively. However, the UNB technique gives best results when it comes to impervious surface classification especially in the case of shadow area included in non-impervious surface group. 
### 105.Fast Cylinder and Plane Extraction from Depth Cameras for Visual  Odometry [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02380.pdf)
> This paper presents CAPE, a method to extract planes and cylinder segments from organized point clouds, which processes 640x480 depth images on a single CPU core at an average of 300 Hz, by operating on a grid of planar cells. While, compared to state-of-the-art plane extraction, the latency of CAPE is more consistent and 4-10 times faster, depending on the scene, we also demonstrate empirically that applying CAPE to visual odometry can improve trajectory estimation on scenes made of cylindrical surfaces (e.g. tunnels), whereas using a plane extraction approach that is not curve-aware deteriorates performance on these scenes. To use these geometric primitives in visual odometry, we propose extending a probabilistic RGB-D odometry framework based on points, lines and planes to cylinder primitives. Following this framework, CAPE runs on fused depth maps and the parameters of cylinders are modelled probabilistically to account for uncertainty and weight accordingly the pose optimization residuals. 
### 106.PI-VIO: Robust and Efficient Stereo Visual Inertial Odometry using  Points and Lines [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02403.pdf)
> In this paper, we present the PerceptIn Visual Inertial Odometry (PI-VIO), a tightly-coupled filtering-based stereo VIO system using both points and lines. Line features help improve system robustness in challenging scenarios when point features cannot be reliably detected or tracked, e.g. low-texture environment or lighting change. In addition, we propose a new lightweight filtering-based loop closing technique to reduce accumulated drift without global bundle adjustment. We formulate loop closure as EKF updates to optimally relocate the current sliding window maintained by the filter to past keyframes. We also present the PerceptIn Ironsides dataset, a new visual-inertial dataset, featuring high-quality synchronized stereo camera and IMU data from the Ironsides sensor with various motion types and textures and millimeter-accuracy groundtruth. To validate the performance of the proposed system, we conduct extensive comparison with state-of-the-art approaches (OKVIS, VINS-MONO and S-MSCKF) using both the public EuRoC dataset and the PerceptIn Ironsides dataset. 
### 107.Categorical Mixture Models on VGGNet activations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02446.pdf)
> In this project, I use unsupervised learning techniques in order to cluster a set of yelp restaurant photos under meaningful topics. In order to do this, I extract layer activations from a pre-trained implementation of the popular VGGNet convolutional neural network. First, I explore using LDA with the activations of convolutional layers as features. Secondly, I explore using the object-recognition powers of VGGNet trained on ImageNet in order to extract meaningful objects from the photos, and then perform LDA to group the photos under topic-archetypes. I find that this second approach finds meaningful archetypes, which match the human intuition for photo topics such as restaurant, food, and drinks. Furthermore, these clusters align well and distinctly with the actual yelp photo labels. 
### 108.Exponential Discriminative Metric Embedding in Deep Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02504.pdf)
> With the remarkable success achieved by the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in object recognition recently, deep learning is being widely used in the computer vision community. Deep Metric Learning (DML), integrating deep learning with conventional metric learning, has set new records in many fields, especially in classification task. In this paper, we propose a replicable DML method, called Include and Exclude (IE) loss, to force the distance between a sample and its designated class center away from the mean distance of this sample to other class centers with a large margin in the exponential feature projection space. With the supervision of IE loss, we can train CNNs to enhance the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, leading to great improvements on several public datasets ranging from object recognition to face verification. We conduct a comparative study of our algorithm with several typical DML methods on three kinds of networks with different capacity. Extensive experiments on three object recognition datasets and two face recognition datasets demonstrate that IE loss is always superior to other mainstream DML methods and approach the state-of-the-art results. 
### 109.Rigid Point Registration with Expectation Conditional Maximization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02518.pdf)
> This paper addresses the issue of matching rigid 3D object points with 2D image points through point registration based on maximum likelihood principle in computer simulated images. Perspective projection is necessary when transforming 3D coordinate into 2D. The problem then recasts into a missing data framework where unknown correspondences are handled via mixture models. Adopting the Expectation Conditional Maximization for Point Registration (ECMPR), two different rotation and translation optimization algorithms are compared in this paper. We analyze in detail the associated consequences in terms of estimation of the registration parameters theoretically and experimentally. 
### 110.Sparse Adversarial Perturbations for Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02536.pdf)
> Although adversarial samples of deep neural networks (DNNs) have been intensively studied on static images, their extensions in videos are never explored. Compared with images, attacking a video needs to consider not only spatial cues but also temporal cues. Moreover, to improve the imperceptibility as well as reduce the computation cost, perturbations should be added on as fewer frames as possible, i.e., adversarial perturbations are temporally sparse. This further motivates the propagation of perturbations, which denotes that perturbations added on the current frame can transfer to the next frames via their temporal interactions. Thus, no (or few) extra perturbations are needed for these frames to misclassify them. To this end, we propose an l2,1-norm based optimization algorithm to compute the sparse adversarial perturbations for videos. We choose the action recognition as the targeted task, and networks with a CNN+RNN architecture as threat models to verify our method. Thanks to the propagation, we can compute perturbations on a shortened version video, and then adapt them to the long version video to fool DNNs. Experimental results on the UCF101 dataset demonstrate that even only one frame in a video is perturbed, the fooling rate can still reach 59.7%. 
### 111.Visual Explanations From Deep 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for  Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02544.pdf)
> We develop three efficient approaches for generating visual explanations from 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for Alzheimer's disease classification. One approach conducts sensitivity analysis on hierarchical 3D image segmentation, and the other two visualize network activations on a spatial map. Visual checks and a quantitative localization benchmark indicate that all approaches identify important brain parts for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Comparative analysis show that the sensitivity analysis based approach has difficulty handling loosely distributed cerebral cortex, and approaches based on visualization of activations are constrained by the resolution of the convolutional layer. The complementarity of these methods improves the understanding of 3D-CNNs in Alzheimer's disease classification from different perspectives. 
### 112.Pyramid Person Matching Network for Person Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02547.pdf)
> In this work, we present a deep convolutional pyramid person matching network (PPMN) with specially designed Pyramid Matching Module to address the problem of person re-identification. The architecture takes a pair of RGB images as input, and outputs a similiarity value indicating whether the two input images represent the same person or not. Based on deep convolutional neural networks, our approach first learns the discriminative semantic representation with the semantic-component-aware features for persons and then employs the Pyramid Matching Module to match the common semantic-components of persons, which is robust to the variation of spatial scales and misalignment of locations posed by viewpoint changes. The above two processes are jointly optimized via a unified end-to-end deep learning scheme. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against the state-of-the-art approaches, especially on the rank-1 recognition rate. 
### 113.Object cosegmentation using deep Siamese network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02555.pdf)
> Object cosegmentation addresses the problem of discovering similar objects from multiple images and segmenting them as foreground simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end pipeline to segment the similar objects simultaneously from relevant set of images using supervised learning via deep-learning framework. We experiment with multiple set of object proposal generation techniques and perform extensive numerical evaluations by training the Siamese network with generated object proposals. Similar objects proposals for the test images are retrieved using the ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) library and deep semantic segmentation is performed on them. Finally, we form a collage from the segmented similar objects based on the relative importance of the objects. 
### 114.Multi-Channel Pyramid Person Matching Network for Person  Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02558.pdf)
> In this work, we present a Multi-Channel deep convolutional Pyramid Person Matching Network (MC-PPMN) based on the combination of the semantic-components and the color-texture distributions to address the problem of person re-identification. In particular, we learn separate deep representations for semantic-components and color-texture distributions from two person images and then employ pyramid person matching network (PPMN) to obtain correspondence representations. These correspondence representations are fused to perform the re-identification task. Further, the proposed framework is optimized via a unified end-to-end deep learning scheme. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against the state-of-the-art literature, especially on the rank-1 recognition rate. 
### 115.Decoupled Spatial Neural Attention for Weakly Supervised Semantic  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02563.pdf)
> Weakly supervised semantic segmentation receives much research attention since it alleviates the need to obtain a large amount of dense pixel-wise ground-truth annotations for the training images. Compared with other forms of weak supervision, image labels are quite efficient to obtain. In our work, we focus on the weakly supervised semantic segmentation with image label annotations. Recent progress for this task has been largely dependent on the quality of generated pseudo-annotations. In this work, inspired by spatial neural-attention for image captioning, we propose a decoupled spatial neural attention network for generating pseudo-annotations. Our decoupled attention structure could simultaneously identify the object regions and localize the discriminative parts which generates high-quality pseudo-annotations in one forward path. The generated pseudo-annotations lead to the segmentation results which achieve the state-of-the-art in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. 
### 116.Generating Goal-Directed Visuomotor Plans Based on Learning Using a  Predictive Coding-type Deep Visuomotor Recurrent Neural Network Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02578.pdf)
> The current paper presents how a predictive coding type deep recurrent neural networks can generate vision-based goal-directed plans based on prior learning experience by examining experiment results using a real arm robot. The proposed deep recurrent neural network learns to predict visuo-proprioceptive sequences by extracting an adequate predictive model from various visuomotor experiences related to object-directed behaviors. The predictive model was developed in terms of mapping from intention state space to expected visuo-proprioceptive sequences space through iterative learning. Our arm robot experiments adopted with three different tasks with different levels of difficulty showed that the error minimization principle in the predictive coding framework applied to inference of the optimal intention states for given goal states can generate goal-directed plans even for unlearned goal states with generalization. It was, however, shown that sufficient generalization requires relatively large number of learning trajectories. The paper discusses possible countermeasure to overcome this problem. 
### 117.Concurrent Spatial and Channel Squeeze &amp; Excitation in Fully  Convolutional Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02579.pdf)
> Fully convolutional neural networks (F-CNNs) have set the state-of-the-art in image segmentation for a plethora of applications. Architectural innovations within F-CNNs have mainly focused on improving spatial encoding or network connectivity to aid gradient flow. In this paper, we explore an alternate direction of recalibrating the feature maps adaptively, to boost meaningful features, while suppressing weak ones. We draw inspiration from the recently proposed squeeze &amp; excitation (SE) module for channel recalibration of feature maps for image classification. Towards this end, we introduce three variants of SE modules for image segmentation, (i) squeezing spatially and exciting channel-wise (cSE), (ii) squeezing channel-wise and exciting spatially (sSE) and (iii) concurrent spatial and channel squeeze &amp; excitation (scSE). We effectively incorporate these SE modules within three different state-of-the-art F-CNNs (DenseNet, SD-Net, U-Net) and observe consistent improvement of performance across all architectures, while minimally effecting model complexity. Evaluations are performed on two challenging applications: whole brain segmentation on MRI scans (Multi-Atlas Labelling Challenge Dataset) and organ segmentation on whole body contrast enhanced CT scans (Visceral Dataset). 
### 118.Single View Stereo Matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02612.pdf)
> Previous monocular depth estimation methods take a single view and directly regress the expected results. Though recent advances are made by applying geometrically inspired loss functions during training, the inference procedure does not explicitly impose any geometrical constraint. Therefore these models purely rely on the quality of data and the effectiveness of learning to generalize. This either leads to suboptimal results or the demand of huge amount of expensive ground truth labelled data to generate reasonable results. In this paper, we show for the first time that the monocular depth estimation problem can be reformulated as two sub-problems, a view synthesis procedure followed by stereo matching, with two intriguing properties, namely i) geometrical constraints can be explicitly imposed during inference; ii) demand on labelled depth data can be greatly alleviated. We show that the whole pipeline can still be trained in an end-to-end fashion and this new formulation plays a critical role in advancing the performance. The resulting model outperforms all the previous monocular depth estimation methods as well as the stereo block matching method in the challenging KITTI dataset by only using a small number of real training data. The model also generalizes well to other monocular depth estimation benchmarks. We also discuss the implications and the advantages of solving monocular depth estimation using stereo methods. 
### 119.3D Human Pose Estimation in RGBD Images for Robotic Task Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02622.pdf)
> We propose an approach to estimate 3D human pose in real world units from a single RGBD image and show that it exceeds performance of monocular 3D pose estimation approaches from color as well as pose estimation exclusively from depth. Our approach builds on robust human keypoint detectors for color images and incorporates depth for lifting into 3D. We combine the system with our learning from demonstration framework to instruct a service robot without the need of markers. Experiments in real world settings demonstrate that our approach enables a PR2 robot to imitate manipulation actions observed from a human teacher. 
### 120.Inferencing Based on Unsupervised Learning of Disentangled  Representations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02627.pdf)
> Combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with encoders that learn to encode data points has shown promising results in learning data representations in an unsupervised way. We propose a framework that combines an encoder and a generator to learn disentangled representations which encode meaningful information about the data distribution without the need for any labels. While current approaches focus mostly on the generative aspects of GANs, our framework can be used to perform inference on both real and generated data points. Experiments on several data sets show that the encoder learns interpretable, disentangled representations which encode descriptive properties and can be used to sample images that exhibit specific characteristics. 
### 121.Learning Spectral-Spatial-Temporal Features via a Recurrent  Convolutional Neural Network for Change Detection in Multispectral Imagery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02642.pdf)
> Change detection is one of the central problems in earth observation and was extensively investigated over recent decades. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent convolutional neural network (ReCNN) architecture, which is trained to learn a joint spectral-spatial-temporal feature representation in a unified framework for change detection in multispectral images. To this end, we bring together a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) into one end-to-end network. The former is able to generate rich spectral-spatial feature representations, while the latter effectively analyzes temporal dependency in bi-temporal images. In comparison with previous approaches to change detection, the proposed network architecture possesses three distinctive properties: 1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most existing methods whose components are separately trained or computed; 2) it naturally harnesses spatial information that has been proven to be beneficial to change detection task; 3) it is capable of adaptively learning the temporal dependency between multitemporal images, unlike most of algorithms that use fairly simple operation like image differencing or stacking. As far as we know, this is the first time that a recurrent convolutional network architecture has been proposed for multitemporal remote sensing image analysis. The proposed network is validated on real multispectral data sets. Both visual and quantitative analysis of experimental results demonstrates competitive performance in the proposed mode. 
### 122.CNN-Based Automatic Urinary Particles Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02699.pdf)
> The urine sediment analysis of particles in microscopic images can assist physicians in evaluating patients with renal and urinary tract diseases. Manual urine sediment examination is labor-intensive, subjective and time-consuming, and the traditional automatic algorithms often extract the hand-crafted features for recognition. Instead of using the hand-crafted features, in this paper, we exploit CNN to learn features in an end-to-end manner to recognize the urine particles. We treat the urine particles recognition as object detection and exploit two state-of-the-art CNN-based object detection methods, Faster R-CNN and SSD, as well as their variants for urine particles recognition. We further investigate different factors involving these CNN-based object detection methods for urine particles recognition. We comprehensively evaluate these methods on a dataset consisting of 5,376 annotated images corresponding to 7 categories of urine particles, i.e., erythrocyte, leukocyte, epithelial cell, crystal, cast, mycete, epithelial nuclei, and obtain a best mAP (mean average precision) of 84.1% while taking only 72 ms per image on a NVIDIA Titan X GPU. 
### 123.Deep Back-Projection Networks For Super-Resolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02735.pdf)
> The feed-forward architectures of recently proposed deep super-resolution networks learn representations of low-resolution inputs, and the non-linear mapping from those to high-resolution output. However, this approach does not fully address the mutual dependencies of low- and high-resolution images. We propose Deep Back-Projection Networks (DBPN), that exploit iterative up- and down-sampling layers, providing an error feedback mechanism for projection errors at each stage. We construct mutually-connected up- and down-sampling stages each of which represents different types of image degradation and high-resolution components. We show that extending this idea to allow concatenation of features across up- and down-sampling stages (Dense DBPN) allows us to reconstruct further improve super-resolution, yielding superior results and in particular establishing new state of the art results for large scaling factors such as 8x across multiple data sets. 
### 124.HENet:A Highly Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks Optimized for  Accuracy, Speed and Storage [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02742.pdf)
> In order to enhance the real-time performance of convolutional neural networks(CNNs), more and more researchers are focusing on improving the efficiency of CNN. Based on the analysis of some CNN architectures, such as ResNet, DenseNet, ShuffleNet and so on, we combined their advantages and proposed a very efficient model called Highly Efficient Networks(HENet). The new architecture uses an unusual way to combine group convolution and channel shuffle which was mentioned in ShuffleNet. Inspired by ResNet and DenseNet, we also proposed a new way to use element-wise addition and concatenation connection with each block. In order to make greater use of feature maps, pooling operations are removed from HENet. The experiments show that our model's efficiency is more than 1 times higher than ShuffleNet on many open source datasets, such as CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN. 
### 125.RTSeg: Real-time Semantic Segmentation Comparative Study [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02758.pdf)
> Semantic segmentation benefits robotics related applications especially autonomous driving. Most of the research on semantic segmentation is only on increasing the accuracy of segmentation models with little attention to computationally efficient solutions. The few work conducted in this direction does not provide principled methods to evaluate the different design choices for segmentation. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a real-time semantic segmentation benchmarking framework with a decoupled design for feature extraction and decoding methods. The framework is comprised of different network architectures for feature extraction such as VGG16, Resnet18, MobileNet, and ShuffleNet. It is also comprised of multiple meta-architectures for segmentation that define the decoding methodology. These include SkipNet, UNet, and Dilation Frontend. Experimental results are presented on the Cityscapes dataset for urban scenes. The modular design allows novel architectures to emerge, that lead to 143x GFLOPs reduction in comparison to SegNet. This benchmarking framework is publicly available at "<a href="https://github.com/MSiam/TFSegmentation">this https URL</a>". 
### 126.Fast and Accurate Semantic Mapping through Geometric-based Incremental  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02784.pdf)
> We propose an efficient and scalable method for incrementally building a dense, semantically annotated 3D map in real-time. The proposed method assigns class probabilities to each region, not each element (e.g., surfel and voxel), of the 3D map which is built up through a robust SLAM framework and incrementally segmented with a geometric-based segmentation method. Differently from all other approaches, our method has a capability of running at over 30Hz while performing all processing components, including SLAM, segmentation, 2D recognition, and updating class probabilities of each segmentation label at every incoming frame, thanks to the high efficiency that characterizes the computationally intensive stages of our framework. By utilizing a specifically designed CNN to improve the frame-wise segmentation result, we can also achieve high accuracy. We validate our method on the NYUv2 dataset by comparing with the state of the art in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, and by means of an analysis in terms of time and space complexity. 
### 127.A Deep Learning Algorithm for One-step Contour Aware Nuclei Segmentation  of Histopathological Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02786.pdf)
> This paper addresses the task of nuclei segmentation in high-resolution histopathological images. We propose an auto- matic end-to-end deep neural network algorithm for segmenta- tion of individual nuclei. A nucleus-boundary model is introduced to predict nuclei and their boundaries simultaneously using a fully convolutional neural network. Given a color normalized image, the model directly outputs an estimated nuclei map and a boundary map. A simple, fast and parameter-free post-processing procedure is performed on the estimated nuclei map to produce the final segmented nuclei. An overlapped patch extraction and assembling method is also designed for seamless prediction of nuclei in large whole-slide images. We also show the effectiveness of data augmentation methods for nuclei segmentation task. Our experiments showed our method outperforms prior state-of-the- art methods. Moreover, it is efficient that one 1000X1000 image can be segmented in less than 5 seconds. This makes it possible to precisely segment the whole-slide image in acceptable time 
### 128.A framework with updateable joint images re-ranking for Person  Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02983.pdf)
> Person re-identification plays an important role in realistic video surveillance with increasing demand for public safety. In this paper, we propose a novel framework with rules of updating images for person re-identification in real-world surveillance system. First, Image Pool is generated by using mean-shift tracking method to automatically select video frame fragments of the target person. Second, features extracted from Image Pool by convolutional network work together to re-rank original ranking list of the main image and matching results will be generated. In addition, updating rules are designed for replacing images in Image Pool when a new image satiating with our updating critical formula in video system. These rules fall into two categories: if the new image is from the same camera as the previous updated image, it will replace one of assist images; otherwise, it will replace the main image directly. Experiments are conduced on Market-1501, iLIDS-VID and PRID-2011 and our ITSD datasets to validate that our framework outperforms on rank-1 accuracy and mAP for person re-identification. Furthermore, the update ability of our framework provides consistently remarkable accuracy rate in real-world surveillance system. 
### 129.Instance Similarity Deep Hashing for Multi-Label Image Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02987.pdf)
> Hash coding has been widely used in the approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale image retrieval. Recently, many deep hashing methods have been proposed and shown largely improved performance over traditional feature-learning-based methods. Most of these methods examine the pairwise similarity on the semantic-level labels, where the pairwise similarity is generally defined in a hard-assignment way. That is, the pairwise similarity is '1' if they share no less than one class label and '0' if they do not share any. However, such similarity definition cannot reflect the similarity ranking for pairwise images that hold multiple labels. In this paper, a new deep hashing method is proposed for multi-label image retrieval by re-defining the pairwise similarity into an instance similarity, where the instance similarity is quantified into a percentage based on the normalized semantic labels. Based on the instance similarity, a weighted cross-entropy loss and a minimum mean square error loss are tailored for loss-function construction, and are efficiently used for simultaneous feature learning and hash coding. Experiments on three popular datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method outperforms the competing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in multi-label image retrieval. 
### 130.Rethinking Feature Distribution for Loss Functions in Image  Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02988.pdf)
> We propose a large-margin Gaussian Mixture (L-GM) loss for deep neural networks in classification tasks. Different from the softmax cross-entropy loss, our proposal is established on the assumption that the deep features of the training set follow a Gaussian Mixture distribution. By involving a classification margin and a likelihood regularization, the L-GM loss facilitates both a high classification performance and an accurate modeling of the training feature distribution. As such, the L-GM loss is superior to the softmax loss and its major variants in the sense that besides classification, it can be readily used to distinguish abnormal inputs, such as the adversarial examples, based on their features' likelihood to the training feature distribution. Extensive experiments on various recognition benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet and LFW, as well as on adversarial examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal. 
### 131.Learning Effective Binary Visual Representations with Deep Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03004.pdf)
> Although traditionally binary visual representations are mainly designed to reduce computational and storage costs in the image retrieval research, this paper argues that binary visual representations can be applied to large scale recognition and detection problems in addition to hashing in retrieval. Furthermore, the binary nature may make it generalize better than its real-valued counterparts. Existing binary hashing methods are either two-stage or hinging on loss term regularization or saturated functions, hence converge slowly and only emit soft binary values. This paper proposes Approximately Binary Clamping (ABC), which is non-saturating, end-to-end trainable, with fast convergence and can output true binary visual representations. ABC achieves comparable accuracy in ImageNet classification as its real-valued counterpart, and even generalizes better in object detection. On benchmark image retrieval datasets, ABC also outperforms existing hashing methods. 
### 132.Robustness of control point configurations for homography and planar  pose estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03025.pdf)
> In this paper, we investigate the influence of the spatial configuration of a number of $n \geq 4$ control points on the accuracy and robustness of space resection methods, e.g. used by a fiducial marker for pose estimation. We find robust configurations of control points by minimizing the first order perturbed solution of the DLT algorithm which is equivalent to minimizing the condition number of the data matrix. An empirical statistical evaluation is presented verifying that these optimized control point configurations not only increase the performance of the DLT homography estimation but also improve the performance of planar pose estimation methods like IPPE and EPnP, including the iterative minimization of the reprojection error which is the most accurate algorithm. We provide the characteristics of stable control point configurations for real-world noisy camera data that are practically independent on the camera pose and form certain symmetric patterns dependent on the number of points. Finally, we present a comparison of optimized configuration versus the number of control points. 
### 133.Preserving Semantic Relations for Zero-Shot Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03049.pdf)
> Zero-shot learning has gained popularity due to its potential to scale recognition models without requiring additional training data. This is usually achieved by associating categories with their semantic information like attributes. However, we believe that the potential offered by this paradigm is not yet fully exploited. In this work, we propose to utilize the structure of the space spanned by the attributes using a set of relations. We devise objective functions to preserve these relations in the embedding space, thereby inducing semanticity to the embedding space. Through extensive experimental evaluation on five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that inducing semanticity to the embedding space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the standard zero-shot setting as well as the more realistic generalized zero-shot setting. We also demonstrate how the proposed approach can be useful for making approximate semantic inferences about an image belonging to a category for which attribute information is not available. 
### 134.Leveraging Unlabeled Data for Crowd Counting by Learning to Rank [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03095.pdf)
> We propose a novel crowd counting approach that leverages abundantly available unlabeled crowd imagery in a learning-to-rank framework. To induce a ranking of cropped images , we use the observation that any sub-image of a crowded scene image is guaranteed to contain the same number or fewer persons than the super-image. This allows us to address the problem of limited size of existing datasets for crowd counting. We collect two crowd scene datasets from Google using keyword searches and query-by-example image retrieval, respectively. We demonstrate how to efficiently learn from these unlabeled datasets by incorporating learning-to-rank in a multi-task network which simultaneously ranks images and estimates crowd density maps. Experiments on two of the most challenging crowd counting datasets show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art results. 
### 135.Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN for Object Detection in the Wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03243.pdf)
> Object detection typically assumes that training and test data are drawn from an identical distribution, which, however, does not always hold in practice. Such a distribution mismatch will lead to a significant performance drop. In this work, we aim to improve the cross-domain robustness of object detection. We tackle the domain shift on two levels: 1) the image-level shift, such as image style, illumination, etc, and 2) the instance-level shift, such as object appearance, size, etc. We build our approach based on the recent state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN model, and design two domain adaptation components, on image level and instance level, to reduce the domain discrepancy. The two domain adaptation components are based on H-divergence theory, and are implemented by learning a domain classifier in adversarial training manner. The domain classifiers on different levels are further reinforced with a consistency regularization to learn a domain-invariant region proposal network (RPN) in the Faster R-CNN model. We evaluate our newly proposed approach using multiple datasets including Cityscapes, KITTI, SIM10K, etc. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for robust object detection in various domain shift scenarios. 
### 136.Generalization in Metric Learning: Should the Embedding Layer be the  Embedding Layer? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03310.pdf)
> Many recent works advancing deep learning tend to focus on large scale setting with the goal of more effective training and better fitting. This goal might be less applicable to the case of small to medium scale. Studying deep metric learning under such setting, we reason that better generalization could be a big contributing factor to improvement of previous works, as well as the goal for further improvement. <br />We investigate using other layers in a deep metric learning system (beside the embedding layer) for feature extraction and analyze how well they perform on training data and generalize to testing data. From this study, we suggest a new regularization practice and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 3 fine-grained image retrieval benchmarks: Cars-196, CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Online Product. 
### 137.Analysis of Hand Segmentation in the Wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03317.pdf)
> A large number of works in egocentric vision have concentrated on action and object recognition. Detection and segmentation of hands in first-person videos, however, has less been explored. For many applications in this domain, it is necessary to accurately segment not only hands of the camera wearer but also the hands of others with whom he is interacting. Here, we take an in-depth look at the hand segmentation problem. In the quest for robust hand segmentation methods, we evaluated the performance of the state of the art semantic segmentation methods, off the shelf and fine-tuned, on existing datasets. We fine-tune RefineNet, a leading semantic segmentation method, for hand segmentation and find that it does much better than the best contenders. Existing hand segmentation datasets are collected in the laboratory settings. To overcome this limitation, we contribute by collecting two new datasets: a) EgoYouTubeHands including egocentric videos containing hands in the wild, and b) HandOverFace to analyze the performance of our models in presence of similar appearance occlusions. We further explore whether conditional random fields can help refine generated hand segmentations. To demonstrate the benefit of accurate hand maps, we train a CNN for hand-based activity recognition and achieve higher accuracy when a CNN was trained using hand maps produced by the fine-tuned RefineNet. Finally, we annotate a subset of the EgoHands dataset for fine-grained action recognition and show that an accuracy of 58.6% can be achieved by just looking at a single hand pose which is much better than the chance level (12.5%). 
### 138.Motion deblurring of faces [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03330.pdf)
> Face analysis is a core part of computer vision, in which remarkable progress has been observed in the past decades. Current methods achieve recognition and tracking with invariance to fundamental modes of variation such as illumination, 3D pose, expressions. Notwithstanding, a much less standing mode of variation is motion deblurring, which however presents substantial challenges in face analysis. Recent approaches either make oversimplifying assumptions, e.g. in cases of joint optimization with other tasks, or fail to preserve the highly structured shape/identity information. Therefore, we propose a data-driven method that encourages identity preservation. The proposed model includes two parallel streams (sub-networks): the first deblurs the image, the second implicitly extracts and projects the identity of both the sharp and the blurred image in similar subspaces. We devise a method for creating realistic motion blur by averaging a variable number of frames to train our model. The averaged images originate from a 2MF2 dataset with 10 million facial frames, which we introduce for the task. Considering deblurring as an intermediate step, we utilize the deblurred outputs to conduct a thorough experimentation on high-level face analysis tasks, i.e. landmark localization and face verification. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our method. 
### 139.Adversarial Training for Adverse Conditions: Robust Metric Localisation  using Appearance Transfer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03341.pdf)
> We present a method of improving visual place recognition and metric localisation under very strong appear- ance change. We learn an invertable generator that can trans- form the conditions of images, e.g. from day to night, summer to winter etc. This image transforming filter is explicitly designed to aid and abet feature-matching using a new loss based on SURF detector and dense descriptor maps. A network is trained to output synthetic images optimised for feature matching given only an input RGB image, and these generated images are used to localize the robot against a previously built map using traditional sparse matching approaches. We benchmark our results using multiple traversals of the Oxford RobotCar Dataset over a year-long period, using one traversal as a map and the other to localise. We show that this method significantly improves place recognition and localisation under changing and adverse conditions, while reducing the number of mapping runs needed to successfully achieve reliable localisation. 
### 140.Deep Semantic Face Deblurring [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03345.pdf)
> In this paper, we present an effective and efficient face deblurring algorithm by exploiting semantic cues via deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). As face images are highly structured and share several key semantic components (e.g., eyes and mouths), the semantic information of a face provides a strong prior for restoration. As such, we propose to incorporate global semantic priors as input and impose local structure losses to regularize the output within a multi-scale deep CNN. We train the network with perceptual and adversarial losses to generate photo-realistic results and develop an incremental training strategy to handle random blur kernels in the wild. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed face deblurring algorithm restores sharp images with more facial details and performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of restoration quality, face recognition and execution speed. 
### 141.Tracking by Prediction: A Deep Generative Model for Mutli-Person  localisation and Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03347.pdf)
> Current multi-person localisation and tracking systems have an over reliance on the use of appearance models for target re-identification and almost no approaches employ a complete deep learning solution for both objectives. We present a novel, complete deep learning framework for multi-person localisation and tracking. In this context we first introduce a light weight sequential Generative Adversarial Network architecture for person localisation, which overcomes issues related to occlusions and noisy detections, typically found in a multi person environment. In the proposed tracking framework we build upon recent advances in pedestrian trajectory prediction approaches and propose a novel data association scheme based on predicted trajectories. This removes the need for computationally expensive person re-identification systems based on appearance features and generates human like trajectories with minimal fragmentation. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple public benchmarks including both static and dynamic cameras and is capable of generating outstanding performance, especially among other recently proposed deep neural network based approaches. 
### 142.Indoor Scene Understanding in 2.5/3D: A Survey [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03352.pdf)
> With the availability of low-cost and compact 2.5/3D visual sensing devices, computer vision community is experiencing a growing interest in visual scene understanding. This survey paper provides a comprehensive background to this research topic. We begin with a historical perspective, followed by popular 3D data representations and a comparative analysis of available datasets. Before delving into the application specific details, this survey provides a succinct introduction to the core technologies that are the underlying methods extensively used in the literature. Afterwards, we review the developed techniques according to a taxonomy based on the scene understanding tasks. This covers holistic indoor scene understanding as well as subtasks such as scene classification, object detection, pose estimation, semantic segmentation, 3D reconstruction, saliency detection, physics-based reasoning and affordance prediction. Later on, we summarize the performance metrics used for evaluation in different tasks and a quantitative comparison among the recent state-of-the-art techniques. We conclude this review with the current challenges and an outlook towards the open research problems requiring further investigation. 
### 143.Task Specific Visual Saliency Prediction with Memory Augmented  Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03354.pdf)
> Visual saliency patterns are the result of a variety of factors aside from the image being parsed, however existing approaches have ignored these. To address this limitation, we propose a novel saliency estimation model which leverages the semantic modelling power of conditional generative adversarial networks together with memory architectures which capture the subject's behavioural patterns and task dependent factors. We make contributions aiming to bridge the gap between bottom-up feature learning capabilities in modern deep learning architectures and traditional top-down hand-crafted features based methods for task specific saliency modelling. The conditional nature of the proposed framework enables us to learn contextual semantics and relationships among different tasks together, instead of learning them separately for each task. Our studies not only shed light on a novel application area for generative adversarial networks, but also emphasise the importance of task specific saliency modelling and demonstrate the plausibility of fully capturing this context via an augmented memory architecture. 
### 144.Learning a Discriminative Prior for Blind Image Deblurring [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03363.pdf)
> We present an effective blind image deblurring method based on a data-driven discriminative prior.Our work is motivated by the fact that a good image prior should favor clear images over blurred images.In this work, we formulate the image prior as a binary classifier which can be achieved by a deep convolutional neural network (CNN).The learned prior is able to distinguish whether an input image is clear or not.Embedded into the maximum a posterior (MAP) framework, it helps blind deblurring in various scenarios, including natural, face, text, and low-illumination images.However, it is difficult to optimize the deblurring method with the learned image prior as it involves a non-linear CNN.Therefore, we develop an efficient numerical approach based on the half-quadratic splitting method and gradient decent algorithm to solve the proposed model.Furthermore, the proposed model can be easily extended to non-uniform deblurring.Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms as well as domain-specific image deblurring approaches. 
### 145.Review of Visual Saliency Detection with Comprehensive Information [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03391.pdf)
> Visual saliency detection model simulates the human visual system to perceive the scene, and has been widely used in many vision tasks. With the acquisition technology development, more comprehensive information, such as depth cue, inter-image correspondence, or temporal relationship, is available to extend image saliency detection to RGBD saliency detection, co-saliency detection, or video saliency detection. RGBD saliency detection model focuses on extracting the salient regions from RGBD images by combining the depth information. Co-saliency detection model introduces the inter-image correspondence constraint to discover the common salient object in an image group. The goal of video saliency detection model is to locate the motion-related salient object in video sequences, which considers the motion cue and spatiotemporal constraint jointly. In this paper, we review different types of saliency detection algorithms, summarize the important issues of the existing methods, and discuss the existent problems and future works. Moreover, the evaluation datasets and quantitative measurements are briefly introduced, and the experimental analysis and discission are conducted to provide a holistic overview of different saliency detection methods. 
### 146.Cross-View Image Synthesis using Conditional GANs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03396.pdf)
> Learning to generate natural scenes has always been a challenging task in computer vision. It is even more painstaking when the generation is conditioned on images with drastically different views. This is mainly because understanding, corresponding, and transforming appearance and semantic information across the views is not trivial. In this paper, we attempt to solve the novel problem of cross-view image synthesis, aerial to street-view and vice versa, using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). Two new architectures called Crossview Fork (X-Fork) and Crossview Sequential (X-Seq) are proposed to generate scenes with resolutions of 64x64 and 256x256 pixels. X-Fork architecture has a single discriminator and a single generator. The generator hallucinates both the image and its semantic segmentation in the target view. X-Seq architecture utilizes two cGANs. The first one generates the target image which is subsequently fed to the second cGAN for generating its corresponding semantic segmentation map. The feedback from the second cGAN helps the first cGAN generate sharper images. Both of our proposed architectures learn to generate natural images as well as their semantic segmentation maps. The proposed methods show that they are able to capture and maintain the true semantics of objects in source and target views better than the traditional image-to-image translation method which considers only the visual appearance of the scene. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations support the effectiveness of our frameworks, compared to two state of the art methods, for natural scene generation across drastically different views. 
### 147.Fusing Hierarchical Convolutional Features for Human Body Segmentation  and Clothing Fashion Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03415.pdf)
> The clothing fashion reflects the common aesthetics that people share with each other in dressing. To recognize the fashion time of a clothing is meaningful for both an individual and the industry. In this paper, under the assumption that the clothing fashion changes year by year, the fashion-time recognition problem is mapped into a clothing-fashion classification problem. Specifically, a novel deep neural network is proposed which achieves accurate human body segmentation by fusing multi-scale convolutional features in a fully convolutional network, and then feature learning and fashion classification are performed on the segmented parts avoiding the influence of image background. In the experiments, 9,339 fashion images from 8 continuous years are collected for performance evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed body segmentation and fashion classification methods. 
### 148.Robust Landmark Detection for Alignment of Mouse Brain Section Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03420.pdf)
> Brightfield and fluorescent imaging of whole brain sections are funda- mental tools of research in mouse brain study. As sectioning and imaging become more efficient, there is an increasing need to automate the post-processing of sec- tions for alignment and three dimensional visualization. There is a further need to facilitate the development of a digital atlas, i.e. a brain-wide map annotated with cell type and tract tracing data, which would allow the automatic registra- tion of images stacks to a common coordinate system. Currently, registration of slices requires manual identification of landmarks. In this work we describe the first steps in developing a semi-automated system to construct a histology at- las of mouse brainstem that combines atlas-guided annotation, landmark-based registration and atlas generation in an iterative framework. We describe an unsu- pervised approach for identifying and matching region and boundary landmarks, based on modelling texture. Experiments show that the detected landmarks corre- spond well with brain structures, and matching is robust under distortion. These results will serve as the basis for registration and atlas building. 
### 149.Solving Fourier ptychographic imaging problems via neural network  modeling and TensorFlow [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03434.pdf)
> Fourier ptychography is a recently developed imaging approach for large field-of-view and high-resolution microscopy. Here we model the Fourier ptychographic forward imaging process using a convolution neural network (CNN) and recover the complex object information in the network training process. In this approach, the input of the network is the point spread function in the spatial domain or the coherent transfer function in the Fourier domain. The object is treated as 2D learnable weights of a convolution or a multiplication layer. The output of the network is modeled as the loss function we aim to minimize. The batch size of the network corresponds to the number of captured low-resolution images in one forward / backward pass. We use a popular open-source machine learning library, TensorFlow, for setting up the network and conducting the optimization process. We analyze the performance of different learning rates, different solvers, and different batch sizes. It is shown that a large batch size with the Adam optimizer achieves the best performance in general. To accelerate the phase retrieval process, we also discuss a strategy to implement Fourier-magnitude projection using a multiplication neural network model. Since convolution and multiplication are the two most-common operations in imaging modeling, the reported approach may provide a new perspective to examine many coherent and incoherent systems. As a demonstration, we discuss the extensions of the reported networks for modeling single-pixel imaging and structured illumination microscopy (SIM). 4-frame resolution doubling is demonstrated using a neural network for SIM. We have made our implementation code open-source for the broad research community. 
### 150.An end-to-end TextSpotter with Explicit Alignment and Attention [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03474.pdf)
> Text detection and recognition in natural images have long been considered as two separate tasks that are processed sequentially. Training of two tasks in a unified framework is non-trivial due to significant dif- ferences in optimisation difficulties. In this work, we present a conceptually simple yet efficient framework that simultaneously processes the two tasks in one shot. Our main contributions are three-fold: 1) we propose a novel text-alignment layer that allows it to precisely compute convolutional features of a text instance in ar- bitrary orientation, which is the key to boost the per- formance; 2) a character attention mechanism is introduced by using character spatial information as explicit supervision, leading to large improvements in recognition; 3) two technologies, together with a new RNN branch for word recognition, are integrated seamlessly into a single model which is end-to-end trainable. This allows the two tasks to work collaboratively by shar- ing convolutional features, which is critical to identify challenging text instances. Our model achieves impressive results in end-to-end recognition on the ICDAR2015 dataset, significantly advancing most recent results, with improvements of F-measure from (0.54, 0.51, 0.47) to (0.82, 0.77, 0.63), by using a strong, weak and generic lexicon respectively. Thanks to joint training, our method can also serve as a good detec- tor by achieving a new state-of-the-art detection performance on two datasets. 
### 151.Cooperative Starting Movement Detection of Cyclists Using Convolutional  Neural Networks and a Boosted Stacking Ensemble [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03487.pdf)
> In future, vehicles and other traffic participants will be interconnected and equipped with various types of sensors, allowing for cooperation on different levels, such as situation prediction or intention detection. In this article we present a cooperative approach for starting movement detection of cyclists using a boosted stacking ensemble approach realizing feature- and decision level cooperation. We introduce a novel method based on a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect starting motions on image sequences by learning spatio-temporal features. The CNN is complemented by a smart device based starting movement detection originating from smart devices carried by the cyclist. Both model outputs are combined in a stacking ensemble approach using an extreme gradient boosting classifier resulting in a fast and yet robust cooperative starting movement detector. We evaluate our cooperative approach on real-world data originating from experiments with 49 test subjects consisting of 84 starting motions. 
### 152.Breast Tumor Classification Based on Decision Information Genes and  Inverse Projection Sparse Representation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03562.pdf)
> Microarray gene expression data-based breast tumor classification is an active and challenging issue. In this paper, a robust framework of breast tumor recognition is presented aiming at reducing clinical misdiagnosis rate and exploiting available information in existing samples. A wrapper gene selection method is established from a new perspective of reducing clinical misdiagnosis rate. The further feature selection of information genes is achieved using the modified NMF model, which is rooted in the use of hierarchical learning and layer-wise pre-training strategy in deep learning. For completing the classification, an inverse projection sparse representation (IPSR) model is constructed to exploit information embedded in existing samples, especially in the test ones. Moreover, the IPSR model is optimized through generalized ADMM and the corresponding convergence is analyzed. Extensive experiments on public microarray gene expression datasets show that the proposed method is stable and effective for breast tumor classification. Compared to the latest open literature, there is 14% higher in classification accuracy. Specificity and sensitivity achieve 94.17% and 97.5%, respectively. 
### 153.Intentions of Vulnerable Road Users - Detection and Forecasting by Means  of Machine Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03577.pdf)
> Avoiding collisions with vulnerable road users (VRUs) using sensor-based early recognition of critical situations is one of the manifold opportunities provided by the current development in the field of intelligent vehicles. As especially pedestrians and cyclists are very agile and have a variety of movement options, modeling their behavior in traffic scenes is a challenging task. In this article we propose movement models based on machine learning methods, in particular artificial neural networks, in order to classify the current motion state and to predict the future trajectory of VRUs. Both model types are also combined to enable the application of specifically trained motion predictors based on a continuously updated pseudo probabilistic state classification. Furthermore, the architecture is used to evaluate motion-specific physical models for starting and stopping and video-based pedestrian motion classification. A comprehensive dataset consisting of 1068 pedestrian and 494 cyclist scenes acquired at an urban intersection is used for optimization, training, and evaluation of the different models. The results show substantial higher classification rates and the ability to earlier recognize motion state changes with the machine learning approaches compared to interacting multiple model (IMM) Kalman Filtering. The trajectory prediction quality is also improved for all kinds of test scenes, especially when starting and stopping motions are included. Here, 37\% and 41\% lower position errors were achieved on average, respectively. 
### 154.Local Kernels that Approximate Bayesian Regularization and Proximal  Operators [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03711.pdf)
> In this work, we broadly connect kernel-based filtering (e.g. approaches such as the bilateral filters and nonlocal means, but also many more) with general variational formulations of Bayesian regularized least squares, and the related concept of proximal operators. The latter set of variational/Bayesian/proximal formulations often result in optimization problems that do not have closed-form solutions, and therefore typically require global iterative solutions. Our main contribution here is to establish how one can approximate the solution of the resulting global optimization problems with use of locally adaptive filters with specific kernels. Our results are valid for small regularization strength but the approach is powerful enough to be useful for a wide range of applications because we expose how to derive a "kernelized" solution to these problems that approximates the global solution in one-shot, using only local operations. As another side benefit in the reverse direction, given a local data-adaptive filter constructed with a particular choice of kernel, we enable the interpretation of such filters in the variational/Bayesian/proximal framework. 
### 155.A Large-Scale Multi-Institutional Evaluation of Advanced Discrimination  Algorithms for Buried Threat Detection in Ground Penetrating Radar [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03729.pdf)
> In this paper we consider the development of algorithms for the automatic detection of buried threats using ground penetrating radar (GPR) measurements. GPR is one of the most studied and successful modalities for automatic buried threat detection (BTD), and a large variety of BTD algorithms have been proposed for it. Despite this, large-scale comparisons of GPR-based BTD algorithms are rare in the literature. In this work we report the results of a multi-institutional effort to develop advanced buried threat detection algorithms for a real-world GPR BTD system. The effort involved five institutions with substantial experience with the development of GPR-based BTD algorithms. In this paper we report the technical details of the advanced algorithms submitted by each institution, representing their latest technical advances, and many state-of-the-art GPR-based BTD algorithms. We also report the results of evaluating the algorithms from each institution on the large experimental dataset used for development. The experimental dataset comprised 120,000 m^2 of GPR data using surface area, from 13 different lanes across two US test sites. The data was collected using a vehicle-mounted GPR system, the variants of which have supplied data for numerous publications. Using these results, we identify the most successful and common processing strategies among the submitted algorithms, and make recommendations for GPR-based BTD algorithm design. 
### 156.Driving Scene Perception Network: Real-time Joint Detection, Depth  Estimation and Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03778.pdf)
> As the demand for enabling high-level autonomous driving has increased in recent years and visual perception is one of the critical features to enable fully autonomous driving, in this paper, we introduce an efficient approach for simultaneous object detection, depth estimation and pixel-level semantic segmentation using a shared convolutional architecture. The proposed network model, which we named Driving Scene Perception Network (DSPNet), uses multi-level feature maps and multi-task learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of object detection, depth estimation and image segmentation tasks from a single input image. Hence, the resulting network model uses less than 850 MiB of GPU memory and achieves 14.0 fps on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 with a 1024x512 input image, and both precision and efficiency have been improved over combination of single tasks. 
### 157.ShuffleSeg: Real-time Semantic Segmentation Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03816.pdf)
> Real-time semantic segmentation is of significant importance for mobile and robotics related applications. We propose a computationally efficient segmentation network which we term as ShuffleSeg. The proposed architecture is based on grouped convolution and channel shuffling in its encoder for improving the performance. An ablation study of different decoding methods is compared including Skip architecture, UNet, and Dilation Frontend. Interesting insights on the speed and accuracy tradeoff is discussed. It is shown that skip architecture in the decoding method provides the best compromise for the goal of real-time performance, while it provides adequate accuracy by utilizing higher resolution feature maps for a more accurate segmentation. ShuffleSeg is evaluated on CityScapes and compared against the state of the art real-time segmentation networks. It achieves 2x GFLOPs reduction, while it provides on par mean intersection over union of 58.3% on CityScapes test set. ShuffleSeg runs at 15.7 frames per second on NVIDIA Jetson TX2, which makes it of great potential for real-time applications. 
### 158.Sample-Relaxed Two-Dimensional Color Principal Component Analysis for  Face Recognition and Image Reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03837.pdf)
> A sample-relaxed two-dimensional color principal component analysis (SR-2DCPCA) approach is presented for face recognition and image reconstruction based on quaternion models. A relaxation vector is automatically generated according to the variances of training color face images with the same label. A sample-relaxed, low-dimensional covariance matrix is constructed based on all the training samples relaxed by a relaxation vector, and its eigenvectors corresponding to the $r$ largest eigenvalues are defined as the optimal projection. The SR-2DCPCA aims to enlarge the global variance rather than to maximize the variance of the projected training samples. The numerical results based on real face data sets validate that SR-2DCPCA has a higher recognition rate than state-of-the-art methods and is efficient in image reconstruction. 
### 159.Learning to Localize Sound Source in Visual Scenes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03849.pdf)
> Visual events are usually accompanied by sounds in our daily lives. We pose the question: Can the machine learn the correspondence between visual scene and the sound, and localize the sound source only by observing sound and visual scene pairs like human? In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised algorithm to address the problem of localizing the sound source in visual scenes. A two-stream network structure which handles each modality, with attention mechanism is developed for sound source localization. Moreover, although our network is formulated within the unsupervised learning framework, it can be extended to a unified architecture with a simple modification for the supervised and semi-supervised learning settings as well. Meanwhile, a new sound source dataset is developed for performance evaluation. Our empirical evaluation shows that the unsupervised method eventually go through false conclusion in some cases. We show that even with a few supervision, false conclusion is able to be corrected and the source of sound in a visual scene can be localized effectively. 
### 160.A Deep Learning Approach for Pose Estimation from Volumetric OCT Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03852.pdf)
> Tracking the pose of instruments is a central problem in image-guided surgery. For microscopic scenarios, optical coherence tomography (OCT) is increasingly used as an imaging modality. OCT is suitable for accurate pose estimation due to its micrometer range resolution and volumetric field of view. However, OCT image processing is challenging due to speckle noise and reflection artifacts in addition to the images' 3D nature. We address pose estimation from OCT volume data with a new deep learning-based tracking framework. For this purpose, we design a new 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to directly predict the 6D pose of a small marker geometry from OCT volumes. We use a hexapod robot to automatically acquire labeled data points which we use to train 3D CNN architectures for multi-output regression. We use this setup to provide an in-depth analysis on deep learning-based pose estimation from volumes. Specifically, we demonstrate that exploiting volume information for pose estimation yields higher accuracy than relying on 2D representations with depth information. Supporting this observation, we provide quantitative and qualitative results that 3D CNNs effectively exploit the depth structure of marker objects. Regarding the deep learning aspect, we present efficient design principles for 3D CNNs, making use of insights from the 2D deep learning community. In particular, we present Inception3D as a new architecture which performs best for our application. We show that our deep learning approach reaches errors at our ground-truth label's resolution. We achieve a mean average error of $\SI{14.89 \pm 9.3}{\micro\metre}$ and $\SI{0.096 \pm 0.072}{\degree}$ for position and orientation learning, respectively. 
### 161.Learning from Noisy Web Data with Category-level Supervision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03857.pdf)
> As tons of photos are being uploaded to public websites (e.g., Flickr, Bing, and Google) every day, learning from web data has become an increasingly popular research direction because of freely available web resources, which is also referred to as webly supervised learning. Nevertheless, the performance gap between webly supervised learning and traditional supervised learning is still very large, owning to the label noise of web data. To be exact, the labels of images crawled from public websites are very noisy and often inaccurate. Some existing works tend to facilitate learning from web data with the aid of extra information, such as augmenting or purifying web data by virtue of instance-level supervision, which is usually in demand of heavy manual annotation. Instead, we propose to tackle the label noise by leveraging more accessible category-level supervision. In particular, we build our method upon variational autoencoder (VAE), in which the classification network is attached on the hidden layer of VAE in a way that the classification network and VAE can jointly leverage the category-level hybrid semantic information. The effectiveness of our proposed method is clearly demonstrated by extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. 
### 162.Knowledge Aided Consistency for Weakly Supervised Phrase Grounding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03879.pdf)
> Given a natural language query, a phrase grounding system aims to localize mentioned objects in an image. In weakly supervised scenario, mapping between image regions (i.e., proposals) and language is not available in the training set. Previous methods address this deficiency by training a grounding system via learning to reconstruct language information contained in input queries from predicted proposals. However, the optimization is solely guided by the reconstruction loss from the language modality, and ignores rich visual information contained in proposals and useful cues from external knowledge. In this paper, we explore the consistency contained in both visual and language modalities, and leverage complementary external knowledge to facilitate weakly supervised grounding. We propose a novel Knowledge Aided Consistency Network (KAC Net) which is optimized by reconstructing input query and proposal's information. To leverage complementary knowledge contained in the visual features, we introduce a Knowledge Based Pooling (KBP) gate to focus on query-related proposals. Experiments show that KAC Net provides a significant improvement on two popular datasets. 
### 163.Unsupervised Learning of Monocular Depth Estimation and Visual Odometry  with Deep Feature Reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03893.pdf)
> Despite learning based methods showing promising results in single view depth estimation and visual odometry, most existing approaches treat the tasks in a supervised manner. Recent approaches to single view depth estimation explore the possibility of learning without full supervision via minimizing photometric error. In this paper, we explore the use of stereo sequences for learning depth and visual odometry. The use of stereo sequences enables the use of both spatial (between left-right pairs) and temporal (forward backward) photometric warp error, and constrains the scene depth and camera motion to be in a common, real-world scale. At test time our framework is able to estimate single view depth and two-view odometry from a monocular sequence. We also show how we can improve on a standard photometric warp loss by considering a warp of deep features. We show through extensive experiments that: (i) jointly training for single view depth and visual odometry improves depth prediction because of the additional constraint imposed on depths and achieves competitive results for visual odometry; (ii) deep feature-based warping loss improves upon simple photometric warp loss for both single view depth estimation and visual odometry. Our method outperforms existing learning based methods on the KITTI driving dataset in both tasks.

### 164.Cubic Range Error Model for Stereo Vision with Illuminators [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03932.pdf)
> Use of low-cost depth sensors, such as a stereo camera setup with illuminators, is of particular interest for numerous applications ranging from robotics and transportation to mixed and augmented reality. The ability to quantify noise is crucial for these applications, e.g., when the sensor is used for map generation or to develop a sensor scheduling policy in a multi-sensor setup. Range error models provide uncertainty estimates and help weigh the data correctly in instances where range measurements are taken from different vantage points or with different sensors. The weighing is important to fuse range data into a map in a meaningful way, i.e., the high confidence data is relied on most heavily. Such a model is derived in this work. We show that the range error for stereo systems with integrated illuminators is cubic and validate the proposed model experimentally with an off-the-shelf structured light stereo system. The experiments confirm the validity of the model and simplify the application of this type of sensor in robotics. The proposed error model is relevant to any stereo system with low ambient light where the main light source is located at the camera system. Among others, this is the case for structured light stereo systems and night stereo systems with headlights. In this work, we propose that the range error is cubic in range for stereo systems with integrated illuminators. Experimental validation with an off-the-shelf structured light stereo system shows that the exponent is between 2.4 and 2.6. The deviation is attributed to our model considering only shot noise. 
### 165.Deeply supervised neural network with short connections for retinal  vessel segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03963.pdf)
> The condition of vessel of the human eye is a fundamental factor for the diagnosis of ophthalmological diseases. Vessel segmentation in fundus image is a challenging task due to low contrast, the presence of microaneurysms and hemorrhages. In this paper, we present a multi-scale and multi-level deeply supervised convolutional neural network with short connections for vessel segmentation. We use short connections to transfer semantic information between side-output layers. Forward short connections could pass low level semantic information to high level and backward short connections could pass much structural information to low level. In addition, we propose using a structural similarity measurement to evaluate the vessel map. The proposed method is verified on DRIVE dataset and it shows superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Specially, with patch level input, the network gets 0.7890 sensitivity, 0.9803 specificity and 0.9802 AUC.

### 166.Deep Dictionary Learning: A PARametric NETwork Approach [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04022.pdf)
> Deep dictionary learning seeks multiple dictionaries at different image scales to capture complementary coherent characteristics. We propose a method for learning a hierarchy of synthesis dictionaries with an image classification goal. The dictionaries and classification parameters are trained by a classification objective, and the sparse features are extracted by reducing a reconstruction loss in each layer. The reconstruction objectives in some sense regularize the classification problem and inject source signal information in the extracted features. The performance of the proposed hierarchical method increases by adding more layers, which consequently makes this model easier to tune and adapt. The proposed algorithm furthermore, shows remarkably lower fooling rate in presence of adversarial perturbation. The validation of the proposed approach is based on its classification performance using four benchmark datasets and is compared to a CNN of similar size. 
### 167.Cascade context encoder for improved inpainting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04033.pdf)
> In this paper, we analyze if cascade usage of the context encoder with increasing input can improve the results of the inpainting. For this purpose, we train context encoder for 64x64 pixels images in a standard way and use its resized output to fill in the missing input region of the 128x128 context encoder, both in training and evaluation phase. As the result, the inpainting is visibly more plausible. In order to thoroughly verify the results, we introduce normalized squared-distortion, a measure for quantitative inpainting evaluation, and we provide its mathematical explanation. This is the first attempt to formalize the inpainting measure, which is based on the properties of latent feature representation, instead of L2 reconstruction loss. 
### 168.Multiple Instance Choquet Integral Classifier Fusion and Regression for  Remote Sensing Applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04048.pdf)
> In classifier (or regression) fusion the aim is to combine the outputs of several algorithms to boost overall performance. Standard supervised fusion algorithms often require accurate and precise training labels. However, accurate labels may be difficult to obtain in many remote sensing applications. This paper proposes novel classification and regression fusion models that can be trained given ambiguosly and imprecisely labeled training data in which training labels are associated with sets of data points (i.e., "bags") instead of individual data points (i.e., "instances") following a multiple instance learning framework. Experiments were conducted based on the proposed algorithms on both synthetic data and applications such as target detection and crop yield prediction given remote sensing data. The proposed algorithms show effective classification and regression performance. 
### 169.Two-Stage Convolutional Neural Network for Breast Cancer Histology Image  Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04054.pdf)
> This paper explores the problem of breast tissue classification of microscopy images. Based on the predominant cancer type the goal is to classify images into four categories of normal, benign, in situ carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma. Given a suitable training dataset, we utilize deep learning techniques to address the classification problem. Due to the large size of each image in the training dataset, we propose a patch-based technique which consists of two consecutive convolutional neural networks. The first "patch-wise" network acts as an auto-encoder that extracts the most salient features of image patches while the second "image-wise" network performs classification of the whole image. The first network is pre-trained and aimed at extracting local information while the second network obtains global information of an input image. We trained the networks using the ICIAR 2018 grand challenge on BreAst Cancer Histology (BACH) dataset. The proposed method yields 95 % accuracy on the validation set compared to previously reported 77 % accuracy rates in the literature. Our code is publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/ImagingLab/ICIAR2018">this https URL</a> 
### 170.Full Reference Objective Quality Assessment for Reconstructed Background  Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04103.pdf)
> With an increased interest in applications that require a clean background image, such as video surveillance, object tracking, street view imaging and location-based services on web-based maps, multiple algorithms have been developed to reconstruct a background image from cluttered scenes. Traditionally, statistical measures and existing image quality techniques have been applied for evaluating the quality of the reconstructed background images. Though these quality assessment methods have been widely used in the past, their performance in evaluating the perceived quality of the reconstructed background image has not been verified. In this work, we discuss the shortcomings in existing metrics and propose a full reference Reconstructed Background image Quality Index (RBQI) that combines color and structural information at multiple scales using a probability summation model to predict the perceived quality in the reconstructed background image given a reference image. To compare the performance of the proposed quality index with existing image quality assessment measures, we construct two different datasets consisting of reconstructed background images and corresponding subjective scores. The quality assessment measures are evaluated by correlating their objective scores with human subjective ratings. The correlation results show that the proposed RBQI outperforms all the existing approaches. Additionally, the constructed datasets and the corresponding subjective scores provide a benchmark to evaluate the performance of future metrics that are developed to evaluate the perceived quality of reconstructed background images. 
### 171.Style Aggregated Network for Facial Landmark Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04108.pdf)
> Recent advances in facial landmark detection achieve success by learning discriminative features from rich deformation of face shapes and poses. Besides the variance of faces themselves, the intrinsic variance of image styles, e.g., grayscale vs. color images, light vs. dark, intense vs. dull, and so on, has constantly been overlooked. This issue becomes inevitable as increasing web images are collected from various sources for training neural networks. In this work, we propose a style-aggregated approach to deal with the large intrinsic variance of image styles for facial landmark detection. Our method transforms original face images to style-aggregated images by a generative adversarial module. The proposed scheme uses the style-aggregated image to maintain face images that are more robust to environmental changes. Then the original face images accompanying with style-aggregated ones play a duet to train a landmark detector which is complementary to each other. In this way, for each face, our method takes two images as input, i.e., one in its original style and the other in the aggregated style. In experiments, we observe that the large variance of image styles would degenerate the performance of facial landmark detectors. Moreover, we show the robustness of our method to the large variance of image styles by comparing to a variant of our approach, in which the generative adversarial module is removed, and no style-aggregated images are used. Our approach is demonstrated to perform well when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark datasets AFLW and 300-W.

### 172.Innovative Texture Database Collecting Approach and Feature Extraction  Method based on Combination of Gray Tone Difference Matrixes, Local Binary  Patterns,and K-means Clustering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04125.pdf)
> Texture analysis and classification are some of the problems which have been paid much attention by image processing scientists since late 80s. If texture analysis is done accurately, it can be used in many cases such as object tracking, visual pattern recognition, and face recognition.Since now, so many methods are offered to solve this problem. Against their technical differences, all of them used same popular databases to evaluate their performance such asBrodatz or Outex, which may be made their performance biased on these databases. In this paper, an approach is proposed to collect more efficient databases of texture images. The proposed approach is included two stages. The first one is developing feature representation based on gray tone difference matrixes and local binary patterns features and the next one is consisted an innovative algorithm which is based on K-means clustering to collect images based on evaluated features. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a texture database is collected and fisher rate is computed for collected one and well known databases. Also, texture classification is evaluated based on offered feature extraction and the accuracy is compared by some state of the art texture classification methods. 
### 173.Deep Class-Wise Hashing: Semantics-Preserving Hashing via Class-wise  Loss [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04137.pdf)
> Deep supervised hashing has emerged as an influential solution to large-scale semantic image retrieval problems in computer vision. In the light of recent progress, convolutional neural network based hashing methods typically seek pair-wise or triplet labels to conduct the similarity preserving learning. However, complex semantic concepts of visual contents are hard to capture by similar/dissimilar labels, which limits the retrieval performance. Generally, pair-wise or triplet losses not only suffer from expensive training costs but also lack in extracting sufficient semantic information. In this regard, we propose a novel deep supervised hashing model to learn more compact class-level similarity preserving binary codes. Our deep learning based model is motivated by deep metric learning that directly takes semantic labels as supervised information in training and generates corresponding discriminant hashing code. Specifically, a novel cubic constraint loss function based on Gaussian distribution is proposed, which preserves semantic variations while penalizes the overlap part of different classes in the embedding space. To address the discrete optimization problem introduced by binary codes, a two-step optimization strategy is proposed to provide efficient training and avoid the problem of gradient vanishing. Extensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark databases show that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Moreover, when training samples are limited, our method surpasses other supervised deep hashing methods with non-negligible margins. 
### 174.Noise2Noise: Learning Image Restoration without Clean Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04189.pdf)
> We apply basic statistical reasoning to signal reconstruction by machine learning -- learning to map corrupted observations to clean signals -- with a simple and powerful conclusion: it is possible to learn to restore images by only looking at corrupted examples, at performance at and sometimes exceeding training using clean data, without explicit image priors or likelihood models of the corruption. In practice, we show that a single model learns photographic noise removal, denoising synthetic Monte Carlo images, and reconstruction of undersampled MRI scans -- all corrupted by different processes -- based on noisy data only. 
### 175.Omnidirectional CNN for Visual Place Recognition and Navigation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04228.pdf)
> $ $Visual place recognition is challenging, especially when only a few place exemplars are given. To mitigate the challenge, we consider place recognition method using omnidirectional cameras and propose a novel Omnidirectional Convolutional Neural Network (O-CNN) to handle severe camera pose variation. Given a visual input, the task of the O-CNN is not to retrieve the matched place exemplar, but to retrieve the closest place exemplar and estimate the relative distance between the input and the closest place. With the ability to estimate relative distance, a heuristic policy is proposed to navigate a robot to the retrieved closest place. Note that the network is designed to take advantage of the omnidirectional view by incorporating circular padding and rotation invariance. To train a powerful O-CNN, we build a virtual world for training on a large scale. We also propose a continuous lifted structured feature embedding loss to learn the concept of distance efficiently. Finally, our experimental results confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed with both the virtual world and real-world datasets. 
### 176.Video Object Segmentation with Joint Re-identification and  Attention-Aware Mask Propagation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04242.pdf)
> The problem of video object segmentation can become extremely challenging when multiple instances co-exist. While each instance may exhibit large scale and pose variations, the problem is compounded when instances occlude each other causing failures in tracking. In this study, we formulate a deep recurrent network that is capable of segmenting and tracking objects in video simultaneously by their temporal continuity, yet able to re-identify them when they re-appear after a prolonged occlusion. We combine both temporal propagation and re-identification functionalities into a single framework that can be trained end-to-end. In particular, we present a re-identification module with template expansion to retrieve missing objects despite their large appearance changes. In addition, we contribute a new attention-based recurrent mask propagation approach that is robust to distractors not belonging to the target segment. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art global mean (Region Jaccard and Boundary F measure) of 68.2 on the challenging DAVIS 2017 benchmark (test-dev set), outperforming the winning solution which achieves a global mean of 66.1 on the same partition. 
### 177.SO-Net: Self-Organizing Network for Point Cloud Analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04249.pdf)
> This paper presents SO-Net, a permutation invariant architecture for deep learning with orderless point clouds. The SO-Net models the spatial distribution of point cloud by building a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Based on the SOM, SO-Net performs hierarchical feature extraction on individual points and SOM nodes, and ultimately represents the input point cloud by a single feature vector. The receptive field of the network can be systematically adjusted by conducting point-to-node k nearest neighbor search. In recognition tasks such as point cloud reconstruction, classification, object part segmentation and shape retrieval, our proposed network demonstrates performance that is similar with or better than state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the training speed is significantly faster than existing point cloud recognition networks because of the parallelizability and simplicity of the proposed architecture. Our code is available at the project website. <a href="https://github.com/lijx10/SO-Net">this https URL</a> 
### 178.Super-Resolution of Sentinel-2 Images: Learning a Globally Applicable  Deep Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04271.pdf)
> The Sentinel-2 satellite mission delivers multi-spectral imagery with 13 spectral bands, acquired at three different spatial resolutions. The aim of this research is to super-resolve the lower-resolution (20 m and 60 m Ground Sampling Distance - GSD) bands to 10 m GSD, so as to obtain a complete data cube at the maximal sensor resolution. We employ a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform end-to-end upsampling, which is trained with data at lower resolution, i.e., from 40-&gt;20 m, respectively 360-&gt;60 m GSD. In this way, one has access to a virtually infinite amount of training data, by downsampling real Sentinel-2 images. We use data sampled globally over a wide range of geographical locations, to obtain a network that generalises across different climate zones and land-cover types, and can super-resolve arbitrary Sentinel-2 images without the need of retraining. In quantitative evaluations (at lower scale, where ground truth is available), our network outperforms the best competing approach by almost 50% in RMSE, while better preserving the spectral characteristics. It also delivers visually convincing results at the full 10 m GSD. 
### 179.In-depth Assessment of an Interactive Graph-based Approach for the  Segmentation for Pancreatic Metastasis in Ultrasound Acquisitions of the  Liver with two Specialists in Internal Medicine [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04279.pdf)
> The manual outlining of hepatic metastasis in (US) ultrasound acquisitions from patients suffering from pancreatic cancer is common practice. However, such pure manual measurements are often very time consuming, and the results repeatedly differ between the raters. In this contribution, we study the in-depth assessment of an interactive graph-based approach for the segmentation for pancreatic metastasis in US images of the liver with two specialists in Internal Medicine. Thereby, evaluating the approach with over one hundred different acquisitions of metastases. The two physicians or the algorithm had never assessed the acquisitions before the evaluation. In summary, the physicians first performed a pure manual outlining followed by an algorithmic segmentation over one month later. As a result, the experts satisfied in up to ninety percent of algorithmic segmentation results. Furthermore, the algorithmic segmentation was much faster than manual outlining and achieved a median Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of over eighty percent. Ultimately, the algorithm enables a fast and accurate segmentation of liver metastasis in clinical US images, which can support the manual outlining in daily practice. 
### 180.Replication study: Development and validation of deep learning algorithm  for detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus photographs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04337.pdf)
> Replication studies are essential for validation of new methods, and are crucial to maintain the high standards of scientific publications, and to use the results in practice. We have attempted to replicate the main method in 'Development and validation of a deep learning algorithm for detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus photographs' published in JAMA 2016; 316(22). We re-implemented the method since the source code is not available, and we used publicly available data sets. The original study used non-public fundus images from EyePACS and three hospitals in India for training. We used a different EyePACS data set from Kaggle. The original study used the benchmark data set Messidor-2 to evaluate the algorithm's performance. We used the same data set. In the original study, ophthalmologists re-graded all images for diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and image gradability. There was one diabetic retinopathy grade per image for our data sets, and we assessed image gradability ourselves. Hyper-parameter settings were not described in the original study. But some of these were later published. We were not able to replicate the original study. Our algorithm's area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.94 on the Kaggle EyePACS test set and 0.80 on Messidor-2 did not come close to the reported AUC of 0.99 in the original study. This may be caused by the use of a single grade per image, different data, or different not described hyper-parameter settings. This study shows the challenges of replicating deep learning, and the need for more replication studies to validate deep learning methods, especially for medical image analysis. <br />Our source code and instructions are available at: <a href="https://github.com/mikevoets/jama16-retina-replication">this https URL</a> 
### 181.Classifying Online Dating Profiles on Tinder using FaceNet Facial  Embeddings [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04347.pdf)
> A method to produce personalized classification models to automatically review online dating profiles on Tinder is proposed, based on the user's historical preference. The method takes advantage of a FaceNet facial classification model to extract features which may be related to facial attractiveness. The embeddings from a FaceNet model were used as the features to describe an individual's face. A user reviewed 8,545 online dating profiles. For each reviewed online dating profile, a feature set was constructed from the profile images which contained just one face. Two approaches are presented to go from the set of features for each face, to a set of profile features. A simple logistic regression trained on the embeddings from just 20 profiles could obtain a 65% validation accuracy. A point of diminishing marginal returns was identified to occur around 80 profiles, at which the model accuracy of 73% would only improve marginally after reviewing a significant number of additional profiles.

> Our understanding of collective animal behavior is limited by our ability to track each of the individuals. We describe an algorithm and software, idtracker.ai, that extracts from video all trajectories with correct identities at a high accuracy for collectives of up to 100 individuals. It uses two deep networks, one detecting when animals touch or cross and another one for animal identification, trained adaptively to conditions and difficulty of the video. 
### 183.Beyond Gr&#xf6;bner Bases: Basis Selection for Minimal Solvers [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04360.pdf)
> Many computer vision applications require robust estimation of the underlying geometry, in terms of camera motion and 3D structure of the scene. These robust methods often rely on running minimal solvers in a RANSAC framework. In this paper we show how we can make polynomial solvers based on the action matrix method faster, by careful selection of the monomial bases. These monomial bases have traditionally been based on a Gr\"obner basis for the polynomial ideal. Here we describe how we can enumerate all such bases in an efficient way. We also show that going beyond Gr\"obner bases leads to more efficient solvers in many cases. We present a novel basis sampling scheme that we evaluate on a number of problems. 
### 184.Discriminability objective for training descriptive captions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04376.pdf)
> One property that remains lacking in image captions generated by contemporary methods is discriminability: being able to tell two images apart given the caption for one of them. We propose a way to improve this aspect of caption generation. By incorporating into the captioning training objective a loss component directly related to ability (by a machine) to disambiguate image/caption matches, we obtain systems that produce much more discriminative caption, according to human evaluation. Remarkably, our approach leads to improvement in other aspects of generated captions, reflected by a battery of standard scores such as BLEU, SPICE etc. Our approach is modular and can be applied to a variety of model/loss combinations commonly proposed for image captioning. 
### 185.Dissimilarity-based representation for radiomics applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04460.pdf)
> Radiomics is a term which refers to the analysis of the large amount of quantitative tumor features extracted from medical images to find useful predictive, diagnostic or prognostic information. Many recent studies have proved that radiomics can offer a lot of useful information that physicians cannot extract from the medical images and can be associated with other information like gene or protein data. However, most of the classification studies in radiomics report the use of feature selection methods without identifying the machine learning challenges behind radiomics. In this paper, we first show that the radiomics problem should be viewed as an high dimensional, low sample size, multi view learning problem, then we compare different solutions proposed in multi view learning for classifying radiomics data. Our experiments, conducted on several real world multi view datasets, show that the intermediate integration methods work significantly better than filter and embedded feature selection methods commonly used in radiomics. 
### 186.An Introduction to Image Synthesis with Generative Adversarial Nets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04469.pdf)
> There has been a drastic growth of research in Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) in the past few years. Proposed in 2014, GAN has been applied to various applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, and achieves impressive performance. Among the many applications of GAN, image synthesis is the most well-studied one, and research in this area has already demonstrated the great potential of using GAN in image synthesis. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of methods used in image synthesis, review different models for text-to-image synthesis and image-to-image translation, and discuss some evaluation metrics as well as possible future research directions in image synthesis with GAN. 
### 187.Correction by Projection: Denoising Images with Generative Adversarial  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04477.pdf)
> Generative adversarial networks (GANs) transform low-dimensional latent vectors into visually plausible images. If the real dataset contains only clean images, then ostensibly, the manifold learned by the GAN should contain only clean images. In this paper, we propose to denoise corrupted images by finding the nearest point on the GAN manifold, recovering latent vectors by minimizing distances in image space. We first demonstrate that given a corrupted version of an image that truly lies on the GAN manifold, we can approximately recover the latent vector and denoise the image, obtaining significantly higher quality, comparing with BM3D. Next, we demonstrate that latent vectors recovered from noisy images exhibit a consistent bias. By subtracting this bias before projecting back to image space, we improve denoising results even further. Finally, even for unseen images, our method performs better at denoising better than BM3D. Notably, the basic version of our method (without bias correction) requires no prior knowledge on the noise variance. To achieve the highest possible denoising quality, the best performing signal processing based methods, such as BM3D, require an estimate of the blur kernel. 
### 188.Event-based Moving Object Detection and Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04523.pdf)
> Event-based vision sensors, such as the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), are ideally suited for real-time motion analysis. The unique properties encompassed in the readings of such sensors provide high temporal resolution, superior sensitivity to light and low latency. These properties provide the grounds to estimate motion extremely reliably in the most sophisticated scenarios but they come at a price - modern event-based vision sensors have extremely low resolution and produce a lot of noise. Moreover, the asynchronous nature of the event stream calls for novel algorithms. <br />This paper presents a new, efficient approach to object tracking with asynchronous cameras. We present a novel event stream representation which enables us to utilize information about the dynamic (temporal) component of the event stream, and not only the spatial component, at every moment of time. This is done by approximating the 3D geometry of the event stream with a parametric model; as a result, the algorithm is capable of producing the motion-compensated event stream (effectively approximating egomotion), and without using any form of external sensors in extremely low-light and noisy conditions without any form of feature tracking or explicit optical flow computation. We demonstrate our framework on the task of independent motion detection and tracking, where we use the temporal model inconsistencies to locate differently moving objects in challenging situations of very fast motion. 
### 189.Learning to recognize Abnormalities in Chest X-Rays with Location-Aware  Dense Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04565.pdf)
> Chest X-ray is the most common medical imaging exam used to assess multiple pathologies. Automated algorithms and tools have the potential to support the reading workflow, improve efficiency, and reduce reading errors. With the availability of large scale data sets, several methods have been proposed to classify pathologies on chest X-ray images. However, most methods report performance based on random image based splitting, ignoring the high probability of the same patient appearing in both training and test set. In addition, most methods fail to explicitly incorporate the spatial information of abnormalities or utilize the high resolution images. We propose a novel approach based on location aware Dense Networks (DNetLoc), whereby we incorporate both high-resolution image data and spatial information for abnormality classification. We evaluate our method on the largest data set reported in the community, containing a total of 86,876 patients and 297,541 chest X-ray images. We achieve (i) the best average AUC score for published training and test splits on the single benchmarking data set (ChestX-Ray14), and (ii) improved AUC scores when the pathology location information is explicitly used. To foster future research we demonstrate the limitations of the current benchmarking setup and provide new reference patient-wise splits for the used data sets. This could support consistent and meaningful benchmarking of future methods on the largest publicly available data sets. 
### 190.Target Driven Instance Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04610.pdf)
> While state-of-the-art general object detectors are getting better and better, there are not many systems specifically designed to take advantage of the instance detection problem. For many applications, such as household robotics, a system may need to recognize a few very specific instances at a time. Speed can be critical in these applications, as can the need to recognize previously unseen instances. We introduce a Target Driven Instance Detector(TDID), which modifies existing general object detectors for the instance recognition setting. TDID not only improves performance on instances seen during training, with a fast runtime, but is also able to generalize to detect novel instances. 
### 191.Maintaining Natural Image Statistics with the Contextual Loss [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04626.pdf)
> Maintaining natural image statistics is a crucial factor in restoration and generation of realistic looking images. When training CNNs, photorealism is usually attempted by adversarial training (GAN), that pushes the output images to lie on the manifold of natural images. GANs are very powerful, but not perfect. They are hard to train and the results still often suffer from artifacts. In this paper we propose a complementary approach, that could be applied with or without GAN, whose goal is to train a feed-forward CNN to maintain natural internal statistics. We look explicitly at the distribution of features in an image and train the network to generate images with natural feature distributions. Our approach reduces by orders of magnitude the number of images required for training and achieves state-of-the-art results on both single-image super-resolution, and high-resolution surface normal estimation. 
### 192.TOM-Net: Learning Transparent Object Matting from a Single Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04636.pdf)
> This paper addresses the problem of transparent object matting. Existing image matting approaches for transparent objects often require tedious capturing procedures and long processing time, which limit their practical use. In this paper, we first formulate transparent object matting as a refractive flow estimation problem. We then propose a deep learning framework, called TOM-Net, for learning the refractive flow. Our framework comprises two parts, namely a multi-scale encoder-decoder network for producing a coarse prediction, and a residual network for refinement. At test time, TOM-Net takes a single image as input, and outputs a matte (consisting of an object mask, an attenuation mask and a refractive flow field) in a fast feed-forward pass. As no off-the-shelf dataset is available for transparent object matting, we create a large-scale synthetic dataset consisting of 158K images of transparent objects rendered in front of images sampled from the Microsoft COCO dataset. We also collect a real dataset consisting of 876 samples using 14 transparent objects and 60 background images. Promising experimental results have been achieved on both synthetic and real data, which clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. 
### 193.Dynamic Vision Sensors for Human Activity Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04667.pdf)
> Unlike conventional cameras which capture video at a fixed frame rate, Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) record only changes in pixel intensity values. The output of DVS is simply a stream of discrete ON/OFF events based on the polarity of change in its pixel values. DVS has many attractive features such as low power consumption, high temporal resolution, high dynamic range and fewer storage requirements. All these make DVS a very promising camera for potential applications in wearable platforms where power consumption is a major concern. <br />In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using DVS for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). We propose to use the various slices (such as $x-y$, $x-t$, and $y-t$) of the DVS video as a feature map for HAR and denote them as Motion Maps. We show that fusing motion maps with Motion Boundary Histogram (MBH) give good performance on the benchmark DVS dataset as well as on a real DVS gesture dataset collected by us. Interestingly, the performance of DVS is comparable to that of conventional videos although DVS captures only sparse motion information. 
### 194.Multi-Frame Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04680.pdf)
> The past few years have witnessed great success in applying deep learning to enhance the quality of compressed image/video. The existing approaches mainly focus on enhancing the quality of a single frame, ignoring the similarity between consecutive frames. In this paper, we investigate that heavy quality fluctuation exists across compressed video frames, and thus low quality frames can be enhanced using the neighboring high quality frames, seen as Multi-Frame Quality Enhancement (MFQE). Accordingly, this paper proposes an MFQE approach for compressed video, as a first attempt in this direction. In our approach, we firstly develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based detector to locate Peak Quality Frames (PQFs) in compressed video. Then, a novel Multi-Frame Convolutional Neural Network (MF-CNN) is designed to enhance the quality of compressed video, in which the non-PQF and its nearest two PQFs are as the input. The MF-CNN compensates motion between the non-PQF and PQFs through the Motion Compensation subnet (MC-subnet). Subsequently, the Quality Enhancement subnet (QE-subnet) reduces compression artifacts of the non-PQF with the help of its nearest PQFs. Finally, the experiments validate the effectiveness and generality of our MFQE approach in advancing the state-of-the-art quality enhancement of compressed video. The code of our MFQE approach is available at <a href="https://github.com/ryangBUAA/MFQE.git">this https URL</a> 
### 195.Multimodal Recurrent Neural Networks with Information Transfer Layers  for Indoor Scene Labeling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04687.pdf)
> This paper proposes a new method called Multimodal RNNs for RGB-D scene semantic segmentation. It is optimized to classify image pixels given two input sources: RGB color channels and Depth maps. It simultaneously performs training of two recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are crossly connected through information transfer layers, which are learnt to adaptively extract relevant cross-modality features. Each RNN model learns its representations from its own previous hidden states and transferred patterns from the other RNNs previous hidden states; thus, both model-specific and crossmodality features are retained. We exploit the structure of quad-directional 2D-RNNs to model the short and long range contextual information in the 2D input image. We carefully designed various baselines to efficiently examine our proposed model structure. We test our Multimodal RNNs method on popular RGB-D benchmarks and show how it outperforms previous methods significantly and achieves competitive results with other state-of-the-art works. 
### 196.Face Spoofing Detection by Fusing Binocular Depth and Spatial Pyramid  Coding Micro-Texture Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04722.pdf)
> Robust features are of vital importance to face spoofing detection, because various situations make feature space extremely complicated to partition. Thus in this paper, two novel and robust features for anti-spoofing are proposed. The first one is a binocular camera based depth feature called Template Face Matched Binocular Depth (TFBD) feature. The second one is a high-level micro-texture based feature called Spatial Pyramid Coding Micro-Texture (SPMT) feature. Novel template face registration algorithm and spatial pyramid coding algorithm are also introduced along with the two novel features. Multi-modal face spoofing detection is implemented based on these two robust features. Experiments are conducted on a widely used dataset and a comprehensive dataset constructed by ourselves. The results reveal that face spoofing detection with the fusion of our proposed features is of strong robustness and time efficiency, meanwhile outperforming other state-of-the-art traditional methods. 
### 197.Video Based Reconstruction of 3D People Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04758.pdf)
> This paper describes how to obtain accurate 3D body models and texture of arbitrary people from a single, monocular video in which a person is moving. Based on a parametric body model, we present a robust processing pipeline achieving 3D model fits with 5mm accuracy also for clothed people. Our main contribution is a method to nonrigidly deform the silhouette cones corresponding to the dynamic human silhouettes, resulting in a visual hull in a common reference frame that enables surface reconstruction. This enables efficient estimation of a consensus 3D shape, texture and implanted animation skeleton based on a large number of frames. We present evaluation results for a number of test subjects and analyze overall performance. Requiring only a smartphone or webcam, our method enables everyone to create their own fully animatable digital double, e.g., for social VR applications or virtual try-on for online fashion shopping. 
### 198.Learning Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation from Multi-view Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04775.pdf)
> Accurate 3D human pose estimation from single images is possible with sophisticated deep-net architectures that have been trained on very large datasets. However, this still leaves open the problem of capturing motions for which no such database exists. Manual annotation is tedious, slow, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose to replace most of the annotations by the use of multiple views, at training time only. Specifically, we train the system to predict the same pose in all views. Such a consistency constraint is necessary but not sufficient to predict accurate poses. We therefore complement it with a supervised loss aiming to predict the correct pose in a small set of labeled images, and with a regularization term that penalizes drift from initial predictions. Furthermore, we propose a method to estimate camera pose jointly with human pose, which lets us utilize multi-view footage where calibration is difficult, e.g., for pan-tilt or moving handheld cameras. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on established benchmarks, as well as on a new Ski dataset with rotating cameras and expert ski motion, for which annotations are truly hard to obtain. 
### 199.Low Rank Variation Dictionary and Inverse Projection Group Sparse  Representation Model for Breast Tumor Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04793.pdf)
> Sparse representation classification achieves good results by addressing recognition problem with sufficient training samples per subject. However, SRC performs not very well for small sample data. In this paper, an inverse-projection group sparse representation model is presented for breast tumor classification, which is based on constructing low-rank variation dictionary. The proposed low-rank variation dictionary tackles tumor recognition problem from the viewpoint of detecting and using variations in gene expression profiles of normal and patients, rather than directly using these samples. The inverse projection group sparsity representation model is constructed based on taking full using of exist samples and group effect of microarray gene data. Extensive experiments on public breast tumor microarray gene expression datasets demonstrate the proposed technique is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. The results of Breast-1, Breast-2 and Breast-3 databases are 80.81%, 89.10% and 100% respectively, which are better than the latest literature. 
### 200.A Learning-Based Visual Saliency Fusion Model for High Dynamic Range  Video (LBVS-HDR) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04827.pdf)
> Saliency prediction for Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) videos has been well explored in the last decade. However, limited studies are available on High Dynamic Range (HDR) Visual Attention Models (VAMs). Considering that the characteristic of HDR content in terms of dynamic range and color gamut is quite different than those of SDR content, it is essential to identify the importance of different saliency attributes of HDR videos for designing a VAM and understand how to combine these features. To this end we propose a learning-based visual saliency fusion method for HDR content (LVBS-HDR) to combine various visual saliency features. In our approach various conspicuity maps are extracted from HDR data, and then for fusing conspicuity maps, a Random Forests algorithm is used to train a model based on the collected data from an eye-tracking experiment. Performance evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fusion method against other existing fusion methods. 
### 201.Independently Recurrent Neural Network (IndRNN): Building A Longer and  Deeper RNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04831.pdf)
> Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been widely used for processing sequential data. However, RNNs are commonly difficult to train due to the well-known gradient vanishing and exploding problems and hard to learn long-term patterns. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) were developed to address these problems, but the use of hyperbolic tangent and the sigmoid action functions results in gradient decay over layers. Consequently, construction of an efficiently trainable deep network is challenging. In addition, all the neurons in an RNN layer are entangled together and their behaviour is hard to interpret. To address these problems, a new type of RNN, referred to as independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN), is proposed in this paper, where neurons in the same layer are independent of each other and they are connected across layers. We have shown that an IndRNN can be easily regulated to prevent the gradient exploding and vanishing problems while allowing the network to learn long-term dependencies. Moreover, an IndRNN can work with non-saturated activation functions such as relu (rectified linear unit) and be still trained robustly. Multiple IndRNNs can be stacked to construct a network that is deeper than the existing RNNs. Experimental results have shown that the proposed IndRNN is able to process very long sequences (over 5000 time steps), can be used to construct very deep networks (21 layers used in the experiment) and still be trained robustly. Better performances have been achieved on various tasks by using IndRNNs compared with the traditional RNN and LSTM.

### 202.3D Video Quality Assessment [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04836.pdf)
> A key factor in designing 3D systems is to understand how different visual cues and distortions affect the perceptual quality of 3D video. The ultimate way to assess video quality is through subjective tests. However, subjective evaluation is time consuming, expensive, and in most cases not even possible. An alternative solution is objective quality metrics, which attempt to model the Human Visual System (HVS) in order to assess the perceptual quality. The potential of 3D technology to significantly improve the immersiveness of video content has been hampered by the difficulty of objectively assessing Quality of Experience (QoE). A no-reference (NR) objective 3D quality metric, which could help determine capturing parameters and improve playback perceptual quality, would be welcomed by camera and display manufactures. Network providers would embrace a full-reference (FR) 3D quality metric, as they could use it to ensure efficient QoE-based resource management during compression and Quality of Service (QoS) during transmission. 
### 203.Resource aware design of a deep convolutional-recurrent neural network  for speech recognition through audio-visual sensor fusion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04840.pdf)
> Today's Automatic Speech Recognition systems only rely on acoustic signals and often don't perform well under noisy conditions. Performing multi-modal speech recognition - processing acoustic speech signals and lip-reading video simultaneously - significantly enhances the performance of such systems, especially in noisy environments. This work presents the design of such an audio-visual system for Automated Speech Recognition, taking memory and computation requirements into account. First, a Long-Short-Term-Memory neural network for acoustic speech recognition is designed. Second, Convolutional Neural Networks are used to model lip-reading features. These are combined with an LSTM network to model temporal dependencies and perform automatic lip-reading on video. Finally, acoustic-speech and visual lip-reading networks are combined to process acoustic and visual features simultaneously. An attention mechanism ensures performance of the model in noisy environments. This system is evaluated on the TCD-TIMIT 'lipspeaker' dataset for audio-visual phoneme recognition with clean audio and with additive white noise at an SNR of 0dB. It achieves 75.70% and 58.55% phoneme accuracy respectively, over 14 percentage points better than the state-of-the-art for all noise levels. 
### 204.A Learning-Based Visual Saliency Prediction Model for Stereoscopic 3D  Video (LBVS-3D) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04842.pdf)
> Over the past decade, many computational saliency prediction models have been proposed for 2D images and videos. Considering that the human visual system has evolved in a natural 3D environment, it is only natural to want to design visual attention models for 3D content. Existing monocular saliency models are not able to accurately predict the attentive regions when applied to 3D image/video content, as they do not incorporate depth information. This paper explores stereoscopic video saliency prediction by exploiting both low-level attributes such as brightness, color, texture, orientation, motion, and depth, as well as high-level cues such as face, person, vehicle, animal, text, and horizon. Our model starts with a rough segmentation and quantifies several intuitive observations such as the effects of visual discomfort level, depth abruptness, motion acceleration, elements of surprise, size and compactness of the salient regions, and emphasizing only a few salient objects in a scene. A new fovea-based model of spatial distance between the image regions is adopted for considering local and global feature calculations. To efficiently fuse the conspicuity maps generated by our method to one single saliency map that is highly correlated with the eye-fixation data, a random forest based algorithm is utilized. The performance of the proposed saliency model is evaluated against the results of an eye-tracking experiment, which involved 24 subjects and an in-house database of 61 captured stereoscopic videos. Our stereo video database as well as the eye-tracking data are publicly available along with this paper. Experiment results show that the proposed saliency prediction method achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 205.Expert identification of visual primitives used by CNNs during mammogram  classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04858.pdf)
> This work interprets the internal representations of deep neural networks trained for classification of diseased tissue in 2D mammograms. We propose an expert-in-the-loop interpretation method to label the behavior of internal units in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Expert radiologists identify that the visual patterns detected by the units are correlated with meaningful medical phenomena such as mass tissue and calcificated vessels. We demonstrate that several trained CNN models are able to produce explanatory descriptions to support the final classification decisions. We view this as an important first step toward interpreting the internal representations of medical classification CNNs and explaining their predictions. 
### 206.Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Determining Reticulocyte  Percentage in Cats [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04873.pdf)
> Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in computer vision (CV) and deep learning (DL), have created opportunities for novel systems in many fields. In the last few years, deep learning applications have demonstrated impressive results not only in fields such as autonomous driving and robotics, but also in the field of medicine, where they have, in some cases, even exceeded human-level performance. However, despite the huge potential, adoption of deep learning-based methods is still slow in many areas, especially in veterinary medicine, where we haven't been able to find any research papers using modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in medical image processing. We believe that using deep learning-based medical imaging can enable more accurate, faster and less expensive diagnoses in veterinary medicine. In order to do so, however, these methods have to be accessible to everyone in this field, not just to computer scientists. To show the potential of this technology, we present results on a real-world task in veterinary medicine that is usually done manually: feline reticulocyte percentage. Using an open source Keras implementation of the Single-Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) model architecture and training it on only 800 labeled images, we achieve an accuracy of 98.7% at predicting the correct number of aggregate reticulocytes in microscope images of cat blood smears. The main motivation behind this paper is to show not only that deep learning can approach or even exceed human-level performance on a task like this, but also that anyone in the field can implement it, even without a background in computer science. 
### 207.Quantization of Fully Convolutional Networks for Accurate Biomedical  Image Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04907.pdf)
> With pervasive applications of medical imaging in health-care, biomedical image segmentation plays a central role in quantitative analysis, clinical diagno- sis, and medical intervention. Since manual anno- tation su ers limited reproducibility, arduous e orts, and excessive time, automatic segmentation is desired to process increasingly larger scale histopathological data. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs), par- ticularly fully convolutional networks (FCNs), have been widely applied to biomedical image segmenta- tion, attaining much improved performance. At the same time, quantization of DNNs has become an ac- tive research topic, which aims to represent weights with less memory (precision) to considerably reduce memory and computation requirements of DNNs while maintaining acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we apply quantization techniques to FCNs for accurate biomedical image segmentation. Unlike existing litera- ture on quantization which primarily targets memory and computation complexity reduction, we apply quan- tization as a method to reduce over tting in FCNs for better accuracy. Speci cally, we focus on a state-of- the-art segmentation framework, suggestive annotation [22], which judiciously extracts representative annota- tion samples from the original training dataset, obtain- ing an e ective small-sized balanced training dataset. We develop two new quantization processes for this framework: (1) suggestive annotation with quantiza- tion for highly representative training samples, and (2) network training with quantization for high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI Gland dataset show that both quantization processes can improve the segmentation performance, and our proposed method exceeds the current state-of-the-art performance by up to 1%. In addition, our method has a reduction of up to 6.4x on memory usage. 
### 208.Automatic Pixelwise Object Labeling for Aerial Imagery Using Stacked  U-Nets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04953.pdf)
> Automation of objects labeling in aerial imagery is a computer vision task with numerous practical applications. Fields like energy exploration require an automated method to process a continuous stream of imagery on a daily basis. In this paper we propose a pipeline to tackle this problem using a stack of convolutional neural networks (U-Net architecture) arranged end-to-end. Each network works as post-processor to the previous one. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art on two different datasets: Inria Aerial Image Labeling dataset and Massachusetts Buildings dataset each with different characteristics such as spatial resolution, object shapes and scales. Moreover, we experimentally validate computation time savings by processing sub-sampled images and later upsampling pixelwise labeling. These savings come at a negligible degradation in segmentation quality. Though the conducted experiments in this paper cover only aerial imagery, the technique presented is general and can handle other types of images. 
### 209.A Framework for Video-Driven Crowd Synthesis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04969.pdf)
> We present a framework for video-driven crowd synthesis. Motion vectors extracted from input crowd video are processed to compute global motion paths. These paths encode the dominant motions observed in the input video. These paths are then fed into a behavior-based crowd simulation framework, which is responsible for synthesizing crowd animations that respect the motion patterns observed in the video. Our system synthesizes 3D virtual crowds by animating virtual humans along the trajectories returned by the crowd simulation framework. We also propose a new metric for comparing the "visual similarity" between the synthesized crowd and exemplar crowd. We demonstrate the proposed approach on crowd videos collected under different settings. 
### 210.LCANet: End-to-End Lipreading with Cascaded Attention-CTC [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04988.pdf)
> Machine lipreading is a special type of automatic speech recognition (ASR) which transcribes human speech by visually interpreting the movement of related face regions including lips, face, and tongue. Recently, deep neural network based lipreading methods show great potential and have exceeded the accuracy of experienced human lipreaders in some benchmark datasets. However, lipreading is still far from being solved, and existing methods tend to have high error rates on the wild data. In this paper, we propose LCANet, an end-to-end deep neural network based lipreading system. LCANet encodes input video frames using a stacked 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), highway network and bidirectional GRU network. The encoder effectively captures both short-term and long-term spatio-temporal information. More importantly, LCANet incorporates a cascaded attention-CTC decoder to generate output texts. By cascading CTC with attention, it partially eliminates the defect of the conditional independence assumption of CTC within the hidden neural layers, and this yields notably performance improvement as well as faster convergence. The experimental results show the proposed system achieves a 1.3% CER and 3.0% WER on the GRID corpus database, leading to a 12.3% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 211.A Multi-Modal Approach to Infer Image Affect [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05070.pdf)
> The group affect or emotion in an image of people can be inferred by extracting features about both the people in the picture and the overall makeup of the scene. The state-of-the-art on this problem investigates a combination of facial features, scene extraction and even audio tonality. This paper combines three additional modalities, namely, human pose, text-based tagging and CNN extracted features / predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time all of the modalities were extracted using deep neural networks. We evaluate the performance of our approach against baselines and identify insights throughout this paper. 
### 212.Revisiting Salient Object Detection: Simultaneous Detection, Ranking,  and Subitizing of Multiple Salient Objects [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05082.pdf)
> Salient object detection is a problem that has been considered in detail and many solutions proposed. In this paper, we argue that work to date has addressed a problem that is relatively ill-posed. Specifically, there is not universal agreement about what constitutes a salient object when multiple observers are queried. This implies that some objects are more likely to be judged salient than others, and implies a relative rank exists on salient objects. The solution presented in this paper solves this more general problem that considers relative rank, and we propose data and metrics suitable to measuring success in a relative object saliency landscape. A novel deep learning solution is proposed based on a hierarchical representation of relative saliency and stage-wise refinement. We also show that the problem of salient object subitizing can be addressed with the same network, and our approach exceeds performance of any prior work across all metrics considered (both traditional and newly proposed). 
### 213.Topology guaranteed segmentation of the human retina from OCT using  convolutional neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05120.pdf)
> Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging modality which can be used to obtain depth images of the retina. The changing layer thicknesses can thus be quantified by analyzing these OCT images, moreover these changes have been shown to correlate with disease progression in multiple sclerosis. Recent automated retinal layer segmentation tools use machine learning methods to perform pixel-wise labeling and graph methods to guarantee the layer hierarchy or topology. However, graph parameters like distance and smoothness constraints must be experimentally assigned by retinal region and pathology, thus degrading the flexibility and time efficiency of the whole framework. In this paper, we develop cascaded deep networks to provide a topologically correct segmentation of the retinal layers in a single feed forward propagation. The first network (S-Net) performs pixel-wise labeling and the second regression network (R-Net) takes the topologically unconstrained S-Net results and outputs layer thicknesses for each layer and each position. Relu activation is used as the final operation of the R-Net which guarantees non-negativity of the output layer thickness. Since the segmentation boundary position is acquired by summing up the corresponding non-negative layer thicknesses, the layer ordering (i.e., topology) of the reconstructed boundaries is guaranteed even at the fovea where the distances between boundaries can be zero. The R-Net is trained using simulated masks and thus can be generalized to provide topology guaranteed segmentation for other layered structures. This deep network has achieved comparable mean absolute boundary error (2.82 {\mu}m) to state-of-the-art graph methods (2.83 {\mu}m). 
### 214.Adversarial Data Programming: Using GANs to Relax the Bottleneck of  Curated Labeled Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05137.pdf)
> Paucity of large curated hand-labeled training data for every domain-of-interest forms a major bottleneck in the deployment of machine learning models in computer vision and other fields. Recent work (Data Programming) has shown how distant supervision signals in the form of labeling functions can be used to obtain labels for given data in near-constant time. In this work, we present Adversarial Data Programming (ADP), which presents an adversarial methodology to generate data as well as a curated aggregated label has given a set of weak labeling functions. We validated our method on the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR 10 and SVHN datasets, and it outperformed many state-of-the-art models. We conducted extensive experiments to study its usefulness, as well as showed how the proposed ADP framework can be used for transfer learning as well as multi-task learning, where data from two domains are generated simultaneously using the framework along with the label information. Our future work will involve understanding the theoretical implications of this new framework from a game-theoretic perspective, as well as explore the performance of the method on more complex datasets. 
### 215.Real-time Cardiovascular MR with Spatio-temporal Artifact Suppression  using Deep Learning - Proof of Concept in Congenital Heart Disease [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05192.pdf)
> PURPOSE: Real-time assessment of ventricular volumes requires high acceleration factors. Residual convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown potential for removing artifacts caused by data undersampling. In this study we investigated the effect of different radial sampling patterns on the accuracy of a CNN. We also acquired actual real-time undersampled radial data in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), and compare CNN reconstruction to Compressed Sensing (CS). <br />METHODS: A 3D (2D plus time) CNN architecture was developed, and trained using 2276 gold-standard paired 3D data sets, with 14x radial undersampling. Four sampling schemes were tested, using 169 previously unseen 3D 'synthetic' test data sets. Actual real-time tiny Golden Angle (tGA) radial SSFP data was acquired in 10 new patients (122 3D data sets), and reconstructed using the 3D CNN as well as a CS algorithm; GRASP. <br />RESULTS: Sampling pattern was shown to be important for image quality, and accurate visualisation of cardiac structures. For actual real-time data, overall reconstruction time with CNN (including creation of aliased images) was shown to be more than 5x faster than GRASP. Additionally, CNN image quality and accuracy of biventricular volumes was observed to be superior to GRASP for the same raw data. <br />CONCLUSION: This paper has demonstrated the potential for the use of a 3D CNN for deep de-aliasing of real-time radial data, within the clinical setting. Clinical measures of ventricular volumes using real-time data with CNN reconstruction are not statistically significantly different from the gold-standard, cardiac gated, BH techniques. 
### 216.EdgeStereo: A Context Integrated Residual Pyramid Network for Stereo  Matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05196.pdf)
> Recent convolutional neural networks, especially end-to-end disparity estimation models, achieve remarkable performance on stereo matching task. However, existed methods, even with the complicated cascade structure, may fail in the regions of non-textures, boundaries and tiny details. Focus on these problems, we propose a multi-task network EdgeStereo that is composed of a backbone disparity network and an edge sub-network. Given a binocular image pair, our model enables end-to-end prediction of both disparity map and edge map. Basically, we design a context pyramid to encode multi-scale context information in disparity branch, followed by a compact residual pyramid for cascaded refinement. To further preserve subtle details, our EdgeStereo model integrates edge cues by feature embedding and edge-aware smoothness loss regularization. Comparative results demonstrates that stereo matching and edge detection can help each other in the unified model. Furthermore, our method achieves state-of-art performance on both KITTI Stereo and Scene Flow benchmarks, which proves the effectiveness of our design. 
### 217.Combining Multi-level Contexts of Superpixel using Convolutional Neural  Networks to perform Natural Scene Labeling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05200.pdf)
> Modern deep learning algorithms have triggered various image segmentation approaches. However most of them deal with pixel based segmentation. However, superpixels provide a certain degree of contextual information while reducing computation cost. In our approach, we have performed superpixel level semantic segmentation considering 3 various levels as neighbours for semantic contexts. Furthermore, we have enlisted a number of ensemble approaches like max-voting and weighted-average. We have also used the Dempster-Shafer theory of uncertainty to analyze confusion among various classes. Our method has proved to be superior to a number of different modern approaches on the same dataset. 
### 218.LivDet 2017 Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition 2017 [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05210.pdf)
> Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection (FPAD) deals with distinguishing images coming from artificial replicas of the fingerprint characteristic, made up of materials like silicone, gelatine or latex, and images coming from alive fingerprints. Images are captured by modern scanners, typically relying on solid-state or optical technologies. Since from 2009, the Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition (LivDet) aims to assess the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms according to a rigorous experimental protocol and, at the same time, a simple overview of the basic achievements. The competition is open to all academics research centers and all companies that work in this field. The positive, increasing trend of the participants number, which supports the success of this initiative, is confirmed even this year: 17 algorithms were submitted to the competition, with a larger involvement of companies and academies. This means that the topic is relevant for both sides, and points out that a lot of work must be done in terms of fundamental and applied research. 
### 219.Deep Image Demosaicking using a Cascade of Convolutional Residual  Denoising Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05215.pdf)
> Demosaicking and denoising are among the most crucial steps of modern digital camera pipelines and their joint treatment is a highly ill-posed inverse problem where at-least two-thirds of the information are missing and the rest are corrupted by noise. This poses a great challenge in obtaining meaningful reconstructions and a special care for the efficient treatment of the problem is required. While there are several machine learning approaches that have been recently introduced to deal with joint image demosaicking-denoising, in this work we propose a novel deep learning architecture which is inspired by powerful classical image regularization methods and large-scale convex optimization techniques. Consequently, our derived network is more transparent and has a clear interpretation compared to alternative competitive deep learning approaches. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms any previous approaches on both noisy and noise-free data. This improvement in reconstruction quality is attributed to the principled way we design our network architecture, which also requires fewer trainable parameters than the current state-of-the-art deep network solution. Finally, we show that our network has the ability to generalize well even when it is trained on small datasets, while keeping the overall number of trainable parameters low. 
### 220.Face-MagNet: Magnifying Feature Maps to Detect Small Faces [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05258.pdf)
> In this paper, we introduce the Face Magnifier Network (Face-MageNet), a face detector based on the Faster-RCNN framework which enables the flow of discriminative information of small scale faces to the classifier without any skip or residual connections. To achieve this, Face-MagNet deploys a set of ConvTranspose, also known as deconvolution, layers in the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and another set before the Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer to facilitate detection of finer faces. In addition, we also design, train, and evaluate three other well-tuned architectures that represent the conventional solutions to the scale problem: context pooling, skip connections, and scale partitioning. Each of these three networks achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art face detectors. With extensive experiments, we show that Face-MagNet based on a VGG16 architecture achieves better results than the recently proposed ResNet101-based HR method on the task of face detection on WIDER dataset and also achieves similar results on the hard set as our other method SSH. 
### 221.Knowledge-based Recurrent Attentive Neural Network for Small Object  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05263.pdf)
> Accurate Traffic Sign Detection (TSD) can help intelligent systems make better decisions according to the traffic regulations. TSD, regarded as a typical small object detection problem in some way, is fundamental in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and self-driving. However, although deep neural networks have achieved human even superhuman performance on several tasks, due to their own limitations, small object detection is still an open question. In this paper, we proposed a brain-inspired network, named as KB-RANN, to handle this problem. Attention mechanism is an essential function of our brain, we used a novel recurrent attentive neural network to improve the detection accuracy in a fine-grained manner. Further, we combined domain specific knowledge and intuitive knowledge to improve the efficiency. Experimental result shows that our methods achieved better performance than several popular methods widely used in object detection. More significantly, we transplanted our method on our designed embedded system and deployed on our self-driving car successfully. 
### 222.Rotation-Sensitive Regression for Oriented Scene Text Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05265.pdf)
> Text in natural images is of arbitrary orientations, requiring detection in terms of oriented bounding boxes. Normally, a multi-oriented text detector often involves two key tasks: 1) text presence detection, which is a classification problem disregarding text orientation; 2) oriented bounding box regression, which concerns about text orientation. Previous methods rely on shared features for both tasks, resulting in degraded performance due to the incompatibility of the two tasks. To address this issue, we propose to perform classification and regression on features of different characteristics, extracted by two network branches of different designs. Concretely, the regression branch extracts rotation-sensitive features by actively rotating the convolutional filters, while the classification branch extracts rotation-invariant features by pooling the rotation-sensitive features. The proposed method named Rotation-sensitive Regression Detector (RRD) achieves state-of-the-art performance on three oriented scene text benchmark datasets, including ICDAR 2015, MSRA-TD500, RCTW-17 and COCO-Text. Furthermore, RRD achieves a significant improvement on a ship collection dataset, demonstrating its generality on oriented object detection. 
### 223.On the Ambiguity of Registration Uncertainty [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05266.pdf)
> Estimating the uncertainty in image registration is an area of current research that is aimed at providing information that will enable surgeons to assess the operative risk based on registered image data and the estimated registration uncertainty. If they receive inaccurately calculated registration uncertainty and misplace confidence in the alignment solutions, severe consequences may result. For probabilistic image registration (PIR), most research quantifies the registration uncertainty using summary statistics of the transformation distributions. In this paper, we study a rarely examined topic: whether those summary statistics of the transformation distribution truly represent the registration uncertainty. Using concrete examples, we show that there are two types of uncertainties: the transformation uncertainty, Ut, and label uncertainty Ul. Ut indicates the doubt concerning transformation parameters and can be estimated by conventional uncertainty measures, while Ul is strongly linked to the goal of registration. Further, we show that using Ut to quantify Ul is inappropriate and can be misleading. In addition, we present some potentially critical findings regarding PIR. 
### 224.Transparency by Design: Closing the Gap Between Performance and  Interpretability in Visual Reasoning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05268.pdf)
> Visual question answering requires high-order reasoning about an image, which is a fundamental capability needed by machine systems to follow complex directives. Recently, modular networks have been shown to be an effective framework for performing visual reasoning tasks. While modular networks were initially designed with a degree of model transparency, their performance on complex visual reasoning benchmarks was lacking. Current state-of-the-art approaches do not provide an effective mechanism for understanding the reasoning process. In this paper, we close the performance gap between interpretable models and state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods. We propose a set of visual-reasoning primitives which, when composed, manifest as a model capable of performing complex reasoning tasks in an explicitly-interpretable manner. The fidelity and interpretability of the primitives' outputs enable an unparalleled ability to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the resulting model. Critically, we show that these primitives are highly performant, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.1% on the CLEVR dataset. We also show that our model is able to effectively learn generalized representations when provided a small amount of data containing novel object attributes. Using the CoGenT generalization task, we show more than a 20 percentage point improvement over the current state of the art. 
### 225.Illumination-aware Faster R-CNN for Robust Multispectral Pedestrian  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05347.pdf)
> Multispectral images of color-thermal pairs have shown more effective than a single color channel for pedestrian detection, especially under challenging illumination conditions. However, there is still a lack of studies on how to fuse the two modalities effectively. In this paper, we deeply compare six different convolutional network fusion architectures and analyse their adaptations, enabling a vanilla architecture to obtain detection performances comparable to the state-of-the-art results. Further, we discover that pedestrian detection confidences from color or thermal images are correlated with illumination conditions. With this in mind, we propose an Illumination-aware Faster R-CNN (IAF RCNN). Specifically, an Illumination-aware Network is introduced to give an illumination measure of the input image. Then we adaptively merge color and thermal sub-networks via a gate function defined over the illumination value. The experimental results on KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Benchmark validate the effectiveness of the proposed IAF R-CNN. 
### 226.Image Colorization with Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05400.pdf)
> Over the last decade, the process of automatic image colorization has been of significant interest for several application areas including restoration of aged or degraded images. This problem is highly ill-posed due to the large degrees of freedom during the assignment of color information. Many of the recent developments in automatic colorization involve images that contain a common theme or require highly processed data such as semantic maps as input. In our approach, we attempt to fully generalize the colorization procedure using a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), extend current methods to high-resolution images and suggest training strategies that speed up the process and greatly stabilize it. The network is trained over datasets that are publicly available such as CIFAR-10 and Places365. The results of the generative model and traditional deep neural networks are compared. 
### 227.Approximate Query Matching for Image Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05401.pdf)
> Traditional image recognition involves identifying the key object in a portrait-type image with a single object focus (ILSVRC, AlexNet, and VGG). More recent approaches consider dense image recognition - segmenting an image with appropriate bounding boxes and performing image recognition within these bounding boxes (Semantic segmentation). The Visual Genome dataset [5] is an attempt to bridge these various approaches to a cohesive dataset for each subtask - bounding box generation, image recognition, captioning, and a new operation: scene graph generation. Our focus is on using such scene graphs to perform graph search on image databases to holistically retrieve images based on a search criteria. We develop a method to store scene graphs and metadata in graph databases (using Neo4J) and to perform fast approximate retrieval of images based on a graph search query. We process more complex queries than single object search, e.g. "girl eating cake" retrieves images that contain the specified relation as well as variations. 
### 228.An application of cascaded 3D fully convolutional networks for medical  image segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05431.pdf)
> Recent advances in 3D fully convolutional networks (FCN) have made it feasible to produce dense voxel-wise predictions of volumetric images. In this work, we show that a multi-class 3D FCN trained on manually labeled CT scans of several anatomical structures (ranging from the large organs to thin vessels) can achieve competitive segmentation results, while avoiding the need for handcrafting features or training class-specific models. <br />To this end, we propose a two-stage, coarse-to-fine approach that will first use a 3D FCN to roughly define a candidate region, which will then be used as input to a second 3D FCN. This reduces the number of voxels the second FCN has to classify to ~10% and allows it to focus on more detailed segmentation of the organs and vessels. <br />We utilize training and validation sets consisting of 331 clinical CT images and test our models on a completely unseen data collection acquired at a different hospital that includes 150 CT scans, targeting three anatomical organs (liver, spleen, and pancreas). In challenging organs such as the pancreas, our cascaded approach improves the mean Dice score from 68.5 to 82.2%, achieving the highest reported average score on this dataset. We compare with a 2D FCN method on a separate dataset of 240 CT scans with 18 classes and achieve a significantly higher performance in small organs and vessels. Furthermore, we explore fine-tuning our models to different datasets. <br />Our experiments illustrate the promise and robustness of current 3D FCN based semantic segmentation of medical images, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### 229.Computer-aided diagnosis of lung carcinoma using deep learning - a pilot  study [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05471.pdf)
> Aim: Early detection and correct diagnosis of lung cancer are the most important steps in improving patient outcome. This study aims to assess which deep learning models perform best in lung cancer diagnosis. Methods: Non-small cell lung carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma biopsy specimens were consecutively obtained and stained. The specimen slides were diagnosed by two experienced pathologists (over 20 years). Several deep learning models were trained to discriminate cancer and non-cancer biopsies. Result: Deep learning models give reasonable AUC from 0.8810 to 0.9119. Conclusion: The deep learning analysis could help to speed up the detection process for the whole-slide image (WSI) and keep the comparable detection rate with human observer. 
### 230.Targeted change detection in remote sensing images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05482.pdf)
> Recent developments in the remote sensing systems and image processing made it possible to propose a new method of the object classification and detection of the specific changes in the series of satellite Earth images (so called targeted change detection). In this paper we propose a formal problem statement that allows to use effectively the deep learning approach to analyze time-dependent series of remote sensing images. We also introduce a new framework for the development of deep learning models for targeted change detection and demonstrate some cases of business applications it can be used for. 
### 231.Improving Object Counting with Heatmap Regulation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05494.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a simple and effective way to improve one-look regression models for object counting from images. We use class activation map visualizations to illustrate the drawbacks of learning a pure one-look regression model for a counting task. Based on these insights, we enhance one-look regression counting models by regulating activation maps from the final convolution layer of the network with coarse ground-truth activation maps generated from simple dot annotations. We call this strategy heatmap regulation (HR). We show that this simple enhancement effectively suppresses false detections generated by the corresponding one-look baseline model and also improves the performance in terms of false negatives. Evaluations are performed on four different counting datasets --- two for car counting (CARPK, PUCPR+), one for crowd counting (WorldExpo) and another for biological cell counting (VGG-Cells). Adding HR to a simple VGG front-end improves performance on all these benchmarks compared to a simple one-look baseline model and results in state-of-the-art performance for car counting. 
### 232.Unpaired Image Captioning by Language Pivoting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05526.pdf)
> Image captioning is a multimodal task involving computer vision and natural language processing, where the goal is to learn a mapping from the image to its natural language description. In general, the mapping function is learned from a training set of image-caption pairs. However, for some language, large scale image-caption paired corpus might not be available. We present an approach to this unpaired image captioning problem by language pivoting. Our method can effectively capture the characteristics of an image captioner from the pivot language (Chinese) and align it to the target language (English) using another pivot-target (Chinese-English) sentence parallel corpus. We evaluate our method on two image-to-English benchmark datasets: MSCOCO and Flickr30K. Quantitative comparisons against several baseline approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 
### 233.Self-Supervised Monocular Image Depth Learning and Confidence Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05530.pdf)
> Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) need large amounts of data with ground truth annotation, which is a challenging problem that has limited the development and fast deployment of CNNs for many computer vision tasks. We propose a novel framework for depth estimation from monocular images with corresponding confidence in a self-supervised manner. A fully differential patch-based cost function is proposed by using the Zero-Mean Normalized Cross Correlation (ZNCC) that takes multi-scale patches as a matching strategy. This approach greatly increases the accuracy and robustness of the depth learning. In addition, the proposed patch-based cost function can provide a 0 to 1 confidence, which is then used to supervise the training of a parallel network for confidence map learning and estimation. Evaluation on KITTI dataset shows that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art results. 
### 234.Evaluation of Dense 3D Reconstruction from 2D Face Images in the Wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05536.pdf)
> This paper investigates the evaluation of dense 3D face reconstruction from a single 2D image in the wild. To this end, we organise a competition that provides a new benchmark dataset that contains 2000 2D facial images of 135 subjects as well as their 3D ground truth face scans. In contrast to previous competitions or challenges, the aim of this new benchmark dataset is to evaluate the accuracy of a 3D dense face reconstruction algorithm using real, accurate and high-resolution 3D ground truth face scans. In addition to the dataset, we provide a standard protocol as well as a Python script for the evaluation. Last, we report the results obtained by three state-of-the-art 3D face reconstruction systems on the new benchmark dataset. The competition is organised along with the 2018 13th IEEE Conference on Automatic Face &amp; Gesture Recognition. 
### 235.Context-Aware Mixed Reality: A Framework for Ubiquitous Interaction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05541.pdf)
> Mixed Reality (MR) is a powerful interactive technology that yields new types of user experience. We present a semantic based interactive MR framework that exceeds the current geometry level approaches, a step change in generating high-level context-aware interactions. Our key insight is to build semantic understanding in MR that not only can greatly enhance user experience through object-specific behaviours, but also pave the way for solving complex interaction design challenges. The framework generates semantic properties of the real world environment through dense scene reconstruction and deep image understanding. We demonstrate our approach with a material-aware prototype system for generating context-aware physical interactions between the real and the virtual objects. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations are carried out and the results show that the framework delivers accurate and fast semantic information in interactive MR environment, providing effective semantic level interactions. 
### 236.Object Detection in Video with Spatiotemporal Sampling Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05549.pdf)
> We propose a Spatiotemporal Sampling Network (STSN) that uses deformable convolutions across time for object detection in videos. Our STSN performs object detection in a video frame by learning to spatially sample features from the adjacent frames. This naturally renders the approach robust to occlusion or motion blur in individual frames. Our framework does not require additional supervision, as it optimizes sampling locations directly with respect to object detection performance. Our STSN outperforms the state-of-the-art on the ImageNet VID dataset and compared to prior video object detection methods it uses a simpler design, and does not require optical flow data for training. 
### 237.Facelet-Bank for Fast Portrait Manipulation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05576.pdf)
> Digital face manipulation has become a popular and fascinating way to touch images with the prevalence of smartphones and social networks. With a wide variety of user preferences, facial expressions, and accessories, a general and flexible model is necessary to accommodate different types of facial editing. In this paper, we propose a model to achieve this goal based on an end-to-end convolutional neural network that supports fast inference, edit-effect control, and quick partial-model update. In addition, this model learns from unpaired image sets with different attributes. Experimental results show that our framework can handle a wide range of expressions, accessories, and makeup effects. It produces high-resolution and high-quality results in fast speed. 
### 238.Deep Adaptive Attention for Joint Facial Action Unit Detection and Face  Alignment [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05588.pdf)
> Facial action unit (AU) detection and face alignment are two highly correlated tasks since facial landmarks can provide precise AU locations to facilitate the extraction of meaningful local features for AU detection. Most existing AU detection works often treat face alignment as a preprocessing and handle the two tasks independently. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning framework for joint AU detection and face alignment, which has not been explored before. In particular, multi-scale shared features are learned firstly, and high-level features of face alignment are fed into AU detection. Moreover, to extract precise local features, we propose an adaptive attention learning module to refine the attention map of each AU adaptively. Finally, the assembled local features are integrated with face alignment features and global features for AU detection. Experiments on BP4D and DISFA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for AU detection. 
### 239.Fast End-to-End Trainable Guided Filter [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05619.pdf)
> Image processing and pixel-wise dense prediction have been advanced by harnessing the capabilities of deep learning. One central issue of deep learning is the limited capacity to handle joint upsampling. We present a deep learning building block for joint upsampling, namely guided filtering layer. This layer aims at efficiently generating the high-resolution output given the corresponding low-resolution one and a high-resolution guidance map. The proposed layer is composed of a guided filter, which is reformulated as a fully differentiable block. To this end, we show that a guided filter can be expressed as a group of spatial varying linear transformation matrices. This layer could be integrated with the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and jointly optimized through end-to-end training. To further take advantage of end-to-end training, we plug in a trainable transformation function that generates task-specific guidance maps. By integrating the CNNs and the proposed layer, we form deep guided filtering networks. The proposed networks are evaluated on five advanced image processing tasks. Experiments on MIT-Adobe FiveK Dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach runs 10-100 times faster and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. We also show that the proposed guided filtering layer helps to improve the performance of multiple pixel-wise dense prediction tasks.

### 240.LEGO: Learning Edge with Geometry all at Once by Watching Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05648.pdf)
> Learning to estimate 3D geometry in a single image by watching unlabeled videos via deep convolutional network is attracting significant attention. In this paper, we introduce a "3D as-smooth-as-possible (3D-ASAP)" prior inside the pipeline, which enables joint estimation of edges and 3D scene, yielding results with significant improvement in accuracy for fine detailed structures. Specifically, we define the 3D-ASAP prior by requiring that any two points recovered in 3D from an image should lie on an existing planar surface if no other cues provided. We design an unsupervised framework that Learns Edges and Geometry (depth, normal) all at Once (LEGO). The predicted edges are embedded into depth and surface normal smoothness terms, where pixels without edges in-between are constrained to satisfy the prior. In our framework, the predicted depths, normals and edges are forced to be consistent all the time. We conduct experiments on KITTI to evaluate our estimated geometry and CityScapes to perform edge evaluation. We show that in all of the tasks, i.e.depth, normal and edge, our algorithm vastly outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, demonstrating the benefits of our approach. 
### 241.Training of Convolutional Networks on Multiple Heterogeneous Datasets  for Street Scene Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05675.pdf)
> We propose a convolutional network with hierarchical classifiers for per-pixel semantic segmentation, which is able to be trained on multiple, heterogeneous datasets and exploit their semantic hierarchy. Our network is the first to be simultaneously trained on three different datasets from the intelligent vehicles domain, i.e. Cityscapes, GTSDB and Mapillary Vistas, and is able to handle different semantic level-of-detail, class imbalances, and different annotation types, i.e. dense per-pixel and sparse bounding-box labels. We assess our hierarchical approach, by comparing against flat, non-hierarchical classifiers and we show improvements in mean pixel accuracy of 13.0% for Cityscapes classes and 2.4% for Vistas classes and 32.3% for GTSDB classes. Our implementation achieves inference rates of 17 fps at a resolution of 520x706 for 108 classes running on a GPU. 
### 242.VEGAC: Visual Saliency-based Age, Gender, and Facial Expression  Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05719.pdf)
> This paper explores the use of Visual Saliency to Classify Age, Gender and Facial Expression for Facial Images. For multi-task classification, we propose our method VEGAC, which is based on Visual Saliency. Using the Deep Multi-level Network [1] and off-the-shelf face detector [2], our proposed method first detects the face in the test image and extracts the CNN predictions on the cropped face. The CNN of VEGAC were fine-tuned on the collected dataset from different benchmarks. Our convolutional neural network (CNN) uses the VGG-16 architecture [3] and is pre-trained on ImageNet for image classification. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method for Age Estimation, Gender Classification, and Facial Expression Classification. We show that we obtain the competitive result with our method on selected benchmarks. All our models and code will be publically available. 
### 243.Exploring Linear Relationship in Feature Map Subspace for ConvNets  Compression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05729.pdf)
> While the research on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is progressing quickly, the real-world deployment of these models is often limited by computing resources and memory constraints. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel filter pruning method to compress and accelerate CNNs. Our work is based on the linear relationship identified in different feature map subspaces via visualization of feature maps. Such linear relationship implies that the information in CNNs is redundant. Our method eliminates the redundancy in convolutional filters by applying subspace clustering to feature maps. In this way, most of the representative information in the network can be retained in each cluster. Therefore, our method provides an effective solution to filter pruning for which most existing methods directly remove filters based on simple heuristics. The proposed method is independent of the network structure, thus it can be adopted by any off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. Experiments on different networks and tasks show that our method outperforms existing techniques before fine-tuning, and achieves the state-of-the-art results after fine-tuning. 
### 244.Diverse M-Best Solutions by Dynamic Programming [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05748.pdf)
> Many computer vision pipelines involve dynamic programming primitives such as finding a shortest path or the minimum energy solution in a tree-shaped probabilistic graphical model. In such cases, extracting not merely the best, but the set of M-best solutions is useful to generate a rich collection of candidate proposals that can be used in downstream processing. In this work, we show how M-best solutions of tree-shaped graphical models can be obtained by dynamic programming on a special graph with M layers. The proposed multi-layer concept is optimal for searching M-best solutions, and so flexible that it can also approximate M-best diverse solutions. We illustrate the usefulness with applications to object detection, panorama stitching and centerline extraction. <br />Note: We have observed that an assumption in section 4 of our paper is not always fulfilled, see the attached corrigendum for details. 
### 245.What Catches the Eye? Visualizing and Understanding Deep Saliency Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05753.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated high performances for fixation prediction in recent years. How they achieve this, however, is less explored and they remain to be black box models. Here, we attempt to shed light on the internal structure of deep saliency models and study what features they extract for fixation prediction. Specifically, we use a simple yet powerful architecture, consisting of only one CNN and a single resolution input, combined with a new loss function for pixel-wise fixation prediction during free viewing of natural scenes. We show that our simple method is on par or better than state-of-the-art complicated saliency models. Furthermore, we propose a method, related to saliency model evaluation metrics, to visualize deep models for fixation prediction. Our method reveals the inner representations of deep models for fixation prediction and provides evidence that saliency, as experienced by humans, is likely to involve high-level semantic knowledge in addition to low-level perceptual cues. Our results can be useful to measure the gap between current saliency models and the human inter-observer model and to build new models to close this gap. 
### 246.Salient Region Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05759.pdf)
> Saliency prediction is a well studied problem in computer vision. Early saliency models were based on low-level hand-crafted feature derived from insights gained in neuroscience and psychophysics. In the wake of deep learning breakthrough, a new cohort of models were proposed based on neural network architectures, allowing significantly higher gaze prediction than previous shallow models, on all metrics. <br />However, most models treat the saliency prediction as a \textit{regression} problem, and accurate regression of high-dimensional data is known to be a hard problem. Furthermore, it is unclear that intermediate levels of saliency (ie, neither very high, nor very low) are meaningful: Something is either salient, or it is not. <br />Drawing from those two observations, we reformulate the saliency prediction problem as a salient region \textit{segmentation} problem. We demonstrate that the reformulation allows for faster convergence than the classical regression problem, while performance is comparable to state-of-the-art. <br />We also visualise the general features learned by the model, which are showed to be consistent with insights from psychophysics. 
### 247.Using accumulation to optimize deep residual neural nets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05778.pdf)
> Residual Neural Networks [1] won first place in all five main tracks of the ImageNet and COCO 2015 competitions. This kind of network involves the creation of pluggable modules such that the output contains a residual from the input. The residual in that paper is the identity function. We propose to include residuals from all lower layers, suitably normalized, to create the residual. This way, all previous layers contribute equally to the output of a layer. We show that our approach is an improvement on [1] for the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
### 248.A predictor-corrector method for the training of deep neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05779.pdf)
> The training of deep neural nets is expensive. We present a predictor- corrector method for the training of deep neural nets. It alternates a predictor pass with a corrector pass using stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation such that there is no loss in validation accuracy. No special modifications to SGD with backpropagation is required by this methodology. Our experiments showed a time improvement of 9% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
### 249.Aggregated Sparse Attention for Steering Angle Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05785.pdf)
> In this paper, we apply the attention mechanism to autonomous driving for steering angle prediction. We propose the first model, applying the recently introduced sparse attention mechanism to visual domain, as well as the aggregated extension for this model. We show the improvement of the proposed method, comparing to no attention as well as to different types of attention. 
### 250.Feature Distillation: DNN-Oriented JPEG Compression Against Adversarial  Examples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05787.pdf)
> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a myriad of realistic applications. However, recent studies show that well-trained DNNs can be easily misled by adversarial examples (AE) -- the maliciously crafted inputs by introducing small and imperceptible input perturbations. Existing mitigation solutions, such as adversarial training and defensive distillation, suffer from expensive retraining cost and demonstrate marginal robustness improvement against the state-of-the-art attacks like CW family adversarial examples. In this work, we propose a novel low-cost "feature distillation" strategy to purify the adversarial input perturbations of AEs by redesigning the popular image compression framework "JPEG". The proposed "feature distillation" wisely maximizes the malicious feature loss of AE perturbations during image compression while suppressing the distortions of benign features essential for high accurate DNN classification. Experimental results show that our method can drastically reduce the success rate of various state-of-the-art AE attacks by ~60% on average for both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmarks without harming the testing accuracy, outperforming existing solutions like default JPEG compression and "feature squeezing". 
### 251.DeepN-JPEG: A Deep Neural Network Favorable JPEG-based Image Compression  Framework [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05788.pdf)
> As one of most fascinating machine learning techniques, deep neural network (DNN) has demonstrated excellent performance in various intelligent tasks such as image classification. DNN achieves such performance, to a large extent, by performing expensive training over huge volumes of training data. To reduce the data storage and transfer overhead in smart resource-limited Internet-of-Thing (IoT) systems, effective data compression is a "must-have" feature before transferring real-time produced dataset for training or classification. While there have been many well-known image compression approaches (such as JPEG), we for the first time find that a human-visual based image compression approach such as JPEG compression is not an optimized solution for DNN systems, especially with high compression ratios. To this end, we develop an image compression framework tailored for DNN applications, named "DeepN-JPEG", to embrace the nature of deep cascaded information process mechanism of DNN architecture. Extensive experiments, based on "ImageNet" dataset with various state-of-the-art DNNs, show that "DeepN-JPEG" can achieve ~3.5x higher compression rate over the popular JPEG solution while maintaining the same accuracy level for image recognition, demonstrating its great potential of storage and power efficiency in DNN-based smart IoT system design. 
### 252.Temporal Human Action Segmentation via Dynamic Clustering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05790.pdf)
> We present an effective dynamic clustering algorithm for the task of temporal human action segmentation, which has comprehensive applications such as robotics, motion analysis, and patient monitoring. Our proposed algorithm is unsupervised, fast, generic to process various types of features, and applicable in both the online and offline settings. We perform extensive experiments of processing data streams, and show that our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art results for both online and offline settings. 
### 253.Local Spectral Graph Convolution for Point Set Feature Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05827.pdf)
> Feature learning on point clouds has shown great promise, with the introduction of effective and generalizable deep learning frameworks such as pointnet++. Thus far, however, point features have been abstracted in an independent and isolated manner, ignoring the relative layout of neighboring points as well as their features. In the present article, we propose to overcome this limitation by using spectral graph convolution on a local graph, combined with a novel graph pooling strategy. In our approach, graph convolution is carried out on a nearest neighbor graph constructed from a point's neighborhood, such that features are jointly learned. We replace the standard max pooling step with a recursive clustering and pooling strategy, devised to aggregate information from within clusters of nodes that are close to one another in their spectral coordinates, leading to richer overall feature descriptors. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, we show a consistent demonstrable advantage for the tasks of both point set classification and segmentation. 
### 254.A Structural Correlation Filter Combined with A Multi-task Gaussian  Particle Filter for Visual Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05845.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel structural correlation filter combined with a multi-task Gaussian particle filter (KCF-GPF) model for robust visual tracking. We first present an assemble structure where several KCF trackers as weak experts provide a preliminary decision for a Gaussian particle filter to make a final decision. The proposed method is designed to exploit and complement the strength of a KCF and a Gaussian particle filter. Compared with the existing tracking methods based on correlation filters or particle filters, the proposed tracker has several advantages. First, it can detect the tracked target in a large-scale search scope via weak KCF trackers and evaluate the reliability of weak trackers\rq decisions for a Gaussian particle filter to make a strong decision, and hence it can tackle fast motions, appearance variations, occlusions and re-detections. Second, it can effectively handle large-scale variations via a Gaussian particle filter. Third, it can be amenable to fully parallel implementation using importance sampling without resampling, thereby it is convenient for VLSI implementation and can lower the computational costs. Extensive experiments on the OTB-2013 dataset containing 50 challenging sequences demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favourably against 16 state-of-the-art trackers. 
### 255.Accurate Facial Parts Localization and Deep Learning for 3D Facial  Expression Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05846.pdf)
> Meaningful facial parts can convey key cues for both facial action unit detection and expression prediction. Textured 3D face scan can provide both detailed 3D geometric shape and 2D texture appearance cues of the face which are beneficial for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). However, accurate facial parts extraction as well as their fusion are challenging tasks. In this paper, a novel system for 3D FER is designed based on accurate facial parts extraction and deep feature fusion of facial parts. In particular, each textured 3D face scan is firstly represented as a 2D texture map and a depth map with one-to-one dense correspondence. Then, the facial parts of both texture map and depth map are extracted using a novel 4-stage process consists of facial landmark localization, facial rotation correction, facial resizing, facial parts bounding box extraction and post-processing procedures. Finally, deep fusion Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) features of all facial parts are learned from both texture maps and depth maps, respectively and nonlinear SVMs are used for expression prediction. Experiments are conducted on the BU-3DFE database, demonstrating the effectiveness of combing different facial parts, texture and depth cues and reporting the state-of-the-art results in comparison with all existing methods under the same setting. 
### 256.I Know What You See: Power Side-Channel Attack on Convolutional Neural  Network Accelerators [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05847.pdf)
> Deep learning has become the de-facto computational paradigm for various kinds of perception problems, including many privacy-sensitive applications such as online medical image analysis. No doubt to say, the data privacy of these deep learning systems is a serious concern. Different from previous research focusing on exploiting privacy leakage from deep learning models, in this paper, we present the first attack on the implementation of deep learning models. To be specific, we perform the attack on an FPGA-based convolutional neural network accelerator and we manage to recover the input image from the collected power traces without knowing the detailed parameters in the neural network by utilizing the characteristics of the "line buffer" performing convolution in the CNN accelerators. For the MNIST dataset, our power side-channel attack is able to achieve up to 89% recognition accuracy. 
### 257.Towards Clinical Diagnosis: Automated Stroke Lesion Segmentation on  Multimodal MR Image Using Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05848.pdf)
> The patient with ischemic stroke can benefit most from the earliest possible definitive diagnosis. While the high quality medical resources are quite scarce across the globe, an automated diagnostic tool is expected in analyzing the magnetic resonance (MR) images to provide reference in clinical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method to automatically segment ischemic stroke lesions from multi-modal MR images. By using atrous convolution and global convolution network, our proposed residual-structured fully convolutional network (Res-FCN) is able to capture features from large receptive fields. The network architecture is validated on a large dataset of 212 clinically acquired multi-modal MR images, which is shown to achieve a mean dice coefficient of 0.645 with a mean number of false negative lesions of 1.515. The false negatives can reach a value that close to a common medical image doctor, making it exceptive for a real clinical application. 
### 258.XNORBIN: A 95 TOp/s/W Hardware Accelerator for Binary Convolutional  Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05849.pdf)
> Deploying state-of-the-art CNNs requires power-hungry processors and off-chip memory. This precludes the implementation of CNNs in low-power embedded systems. Recent research shows CNNs sustain extreme quantization, binarizing their weights and intermediate feature maps, thereby saving 8-32\x memory and collapsing energy-intensive sum-of-products into XNOR-and-popcount operations. <br />We present XNORBIN, an accelerator for binary CNNs with computation tightly coupled to memory for aggressive data reuse. Implemented in UMC 65nm technology XNORBIN achieves an energy efficiency of 95 TOp/s/W and an area efficiency of 2.0 TOp/s/MGE at 0.8 V. 
### 259.Vision-Aided Absolute Trajectory Estimation Using an Unsupervised Deep  Network with Online Error Correction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05850.pdf)
> We present an unsupervised deep neural network approach to the fusion of RGB-D imagery with inertial measurements for absolute trajectory estimation. Our network, dubbed the Visual-Inertial-Odometry Learner (VIOLearner), learns to perform visual-inertial odometry (VIO) without inertial measurement unit (IMU) intrinsic parameters (corresponding to gyroscope and accelerometer bias or white noise) or the extrinsic calibration between an IMU and camera. The network learns to integrate IMU measurements and generate hypothesis trajectories which are then corrected online according to the Jacobians of scaled image projection errors with respect to a spatial grid of pixel coordinates. We evaluate our network against state-of-the-art (SOA) visual-inertial odometry, visual odometry, and visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) approaches on the KITTI Odometry dataset and demonstrate competitive odometry performance. 
### 260.Image Registration Based Flicker Solving in Video Face Replacement and  Analysis Based Sub-pixel Image Registration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05851.pdf)
> In this paper, a framework of video face replacement is proposed and it deals with the flicker of swapped face in video sequence. This framework contains two main innovations: 1) the technique of image registration is exploited to align the source and target video faces for eliminating the flicker or jitter of the segmented video face sequence; 2) a fast subpixel image registration method is proposed for farther accuracy and efficiency. Unlike the priori works, it minimizes the overlapping region and takes spatiotemporal coherence into account. Flicker in resulted videos is usually caused by the frequently changed bound of the blending target face and unregistered faces between and along video sequences. The subpixel image registration method is proposed to solve the flicker problem. During the alignment process, integer pixel registration is formulated by maximizing the similarity of images with down sampling strategy speeding up the process and sub-pixel image registration is a single-step image match via analytic method. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm reduces the computation time and gets a high accuracy when conducting experiments on different data sets. 
### 261.Calculating the Midsagittal Plane for Symmetrical Bilateral Shapes:  Applications to Clinical Facial Surgical Planning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05853.pdf)
> It is difficult to estimate the midsagittal plane of human subjects with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities. We have developed a LAndmark GEometric Routine (LAGER), which automatically estimates a midsagittal plane for such subjects. The LAGER algorithm was based on the assumption that the optimal midsagittal plane of a patient with a deformity is the premorbid midsagittal plane of the patient (i.e. hypothetically normal without deformity). The LAGER algorithm consists of three steps. The first step quantifies the asymmetry of the landmarks using a Euclidean distance matrix analysis and ranks the landmarks according to their degree of asymmetry. The second step uses a recursive algorithm to drop outlier landmarks. The third step inputs the remaining landmarks into an optimization algorithm to determine an optimal midsaggital plane. We validate LAGER on 20 synthetic models mimicking the skulls of real patients with CMF deformities. The results indicated that all the LAGER algorithm-generated midsagittal planes met clinical criteria. Thus it can be used clinically to determine the midsagittal plane for patients with CMF deformities. 
### 262.Development and Validation of Deep Learning Algorithms for Detection of  Critical Findings in Head CT Scans [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05854.pdf)
> Importance: Non-contrast head CT scan is the current standard for initial imaging of patients with head trauma or stroke symptoms. <br />Objective: To develop and validate a set of deep learning algorithms for automated detection of following key findings from non-contrast head CT scans: intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and its types, intraparenchymal (IPH), intraventricular (IVH), subdural (SDH), extradural (EDH) and subarachnoid (SAH) hemorrhages, calvarial fractures, midline shift and mass effect. <br />Design and Settings: We retrospectively collected a dataset containing 313,318 head CT scans along with their clinical reports from various centers. A part of this dataset (Qure25k dataset) was used to validate and the rest to develop algorithms. Additionally, a dataset (CQ500 dataset) was collected from different centers in two batches B1 &amp; B2 to clinically validate the algorithms. <br />Main Outcomes and Measures: Original clinical radiology report and consensus of three independent radiologists were considered as gold standard for Qure25k and CQ500 datasets respectively. Area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for each finding was primarily used to evaluate the algorithms. <br />Results: Qure25k dataset contained 21,095 scans (mean age 43.31; 42.87% female) while batches B1 and B2 of CQ500 dataset consisted of 214 (mean age 43.40; 43.92% female) and 277 (mean age 51.70; 30.31% female) scans respectively. On Qure25k dataset, the algorithms achieved AUCs of 0.9194, 0.8977, 0.9559, 0.9161, 0.9288 and 0.9044 for detecting ICH, IPH, IVH, SDH, EDH and SAH respectively. AUCs for the same on CQ500 dataset were 0.9419, 0.9544, 0.9310, 0.9521, 0.9731 and 0.9574 respectively. For detecting calvarial fractures, midline shift and mass effect, AUCs on Qure25k dataset were 0.9244, 0.9276 and 0.8583 respectively, while AUCs on CQ500 dataset were 0.9624, 0.9697 and 0.9216 respectively. 
### 263.Pseudo Mask Augmented Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05858.pdf)
> In this work, we present a novel and effective framework to facilitate object detection with the instance-level segmentation information that is only supervised by bounding box annotation. Starting from the joint object detection and instance segmentation network, we propose to recursively estimate the pseudo ground-truth object masks from the instance-level object segmentation network training, and then enhance the detection network with top-down segmentation feedbacks. The pseudo ground truth mask and network parameters are optimized alternatively to mutually benefit each other. To obtain the promising pseudo masks in each iteration, we embed a graphical inference that incorporates the low-level image appearance consistency and the bounding box annotations to refine the segmentation masks predicted by the segmentation network. Our approach progressively improves the object detection performance by incorporating the detailed pixel-wise information learned from the weakly-supervised segmentation network. Extensive evaluation on the detection task in PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 [12] verifies that the proposed approach is effective. 
### 264.Learned Iterative Decoding for Lossy Image Compression Systems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05863.pdf)
> For lossy image compression systems, we develop an algorithm called iterative refinement, to improve the decoder's reconstruction compared with standard decoding techniques. Specifically, we propose a recurrent neural network approach for nonlinear, iterative decoding. Our neural decoder, which can work with any encoder, employs self-connected memory units that make use of both causal and non-causal spatial context information to progressively reduce reconstruction error over a fixed number of steps. We experiment with variations of our proposed estimator and obtain as much as a 0.8921 decibel (dB) gain over the standard JPEG algorithm and a 0.5848 dB gain over a state-of-the-art neural compression model. 
### 265.Virtual CNN Branching: Efficient Feature Ensemble for Person  Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05872.pdf)
> In this paper we introduce an ensemble method for convolutional neural network (CNN), called "virtual branching," which can be implemented with nearly no additional parameters and computation on top of standard CNNs. We propose our method in the context of person re-identification (re-ID). Our CNN model consists of shared bottom layers, followed by "virtual" branches, where neurons from a block of regular convolutional and fully-connected layers are partitioned into multiple sets. Each virtual branch is trained with different data to specialize in different aspects, e.g., a specific body region or pose orientation. In this way, robust ensemble representations are obtained against human body misalignment, deformations, or variations in viewing angles, at nearly no any additional cost. The proposed method achieves competitive performance on multiple person re-ID benchmark datasets, including Market-1501, CUHK03, and DukeMTMC-reID. 
### 266.Deep Structure Inference Network for Facial Action Unit Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05873.pdf)
> Facial expressions are combinations of basic components called Action Units (AU). Recognizing AUs is key for developing general facial expression analysis. In recent years, most efforts in automatic AU recognition have been dedicated to learning combinations of local features and to exploiting correlations between Action Units. In this paper, we propose a deep neural architecture that tackles both problems by combining learned local and global features in its initial stages and replicating a message passing algorithm between classes similar to a graphical model inference approach in later stages. We show that by training the model end-to-end with increased supervision we improve state-of-the-art by 5.3% and 8.2% performance on BP4D and DISFA datasets, respectively. 
### 267.Toolflows for Mapping Convolutional Neural Networks on FPGAs: A Survey  and Future Directions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05900.pdf)
> In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various Artificial Intelligence tasks. To accelerate the experimentation and development of CNNs, several software frameworks have been released, primarily targeting power-hungry CPUs and GPUs. In this context, reconfigurable hardware in the form of FPGAs constitutes a potential alternative platform that can be integrated in the existing deep learning ecosystem to provide a tunable balance between performance, power consumption and programmability. In this paper, a survey of the existing CNN-to-FPGA toolflows is presented, comprising a comparative study of their key characteristics which include the supported applications, architectural choices, design space exploration methods and achieved performance. Moreover, major challenges and objectives introduced by the latest trends in CNN algorithmic research are identified and presented. Finally, a uniform evaluation methodology is proposed, aiming at the comprehensive, complete and in-depth evaluation of CNN-to-FPGA toolflows. 
### 268.Efficient Hardware Realization of Convolutional Neural Networks using  Intra-Kernel Regular Pruning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05909.pdf)
> The recent trend toward increasingly deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) leads to a higher demand of computational power and memory storage. Consequently, the deployment of CNNs in hardware has become more challenging. In this paper, we propose an Intra-Kernel Regular (IKR) pruning scheme to reduce the size and computational complexity of the CNNs by removing redundant weights at a fine-grained level. Unlike other pruning methods such as Fine-Grained pruning, IKR pruning maintains regular kernel structures that are exploitable in a hardware accelerator. Experimental results demonstrate up to 10x parameter reduction and 7x computational reduction at a cost of less than 1% degradation in accuracy versus the un-pruned case. 
### 269.A picture is worth a thousand words but how to organize thousands of  pictures? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05940.pdf)
> We live in a society where the large majority of the population has a camera-equipped smartphone. In addition, hard drives and cloud storage are getting cheaper and cheaper, leading to a tremendous growth in stored personal photos. Unlike photo collections captured by a digital camera, which typically are pre-processed by the user who organizes them into event-related folders, smartphone pictures are automatically stored in the cloud. As a consequence, photo collections captured by a smartphone are highly unstructured and because smartphones are ubiquitous, they present a larger variability compared to pictures captured by a digital camera. To solve the need of organizing large smartphone photo collections automatically, we propose here a new methodology for hierarchical photo organization into topics and topic-related categories. Our approach successfully estimates latent topics in the pictures by applying probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis, and automatically assigns a name to each topic by relying on a lexical database. Topic-related categories are then estimated by using a set of topic-specific Convolutional Neuronal Networks. To validate our approach, we ensemble and make public a large dataset of more than 8,000 smartphone pictures from 10 persons. Experimental results demonstrate better user satisfaction with respect to state of the art solutions in terms of organization. 
### 270.Mo2Cap2: Real-time Mobile 3D Motion Capture with a Cap-mounted Fisheye  Camera [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05959.pdf)
> We propose the first real-time approach for the egocentric estimation of 3D human body pose in a wide range of unconstrained everyday activities. This setting has a unique set of challenges, such as mobility of the hardware setup, and robustness to long capture sessions with fast recovery from tracking failures. We tackle these challenges based on a novel lightweight setup that converts a standard baseball cap to a device for high-quality pose estimation based on a single cap-mounted fisheye camera. From the captured egocentric live stream, our CNN based 3D pose estimation approach runs at 60Hz on a consumer-level GPU. In addition to the novel hardware setup, our other main contributions are: 1) a large ground truth training corpus of top-down fisheye images and 2) a novel disentangled 3D pose estimation approach that takes the unique properties of the egocentric viewpoint into account. As shown by our evaluation, we achieve lower 3D joint error as well as better 2D overlay than the existing baselines. 
### 271.Studying Invariances of Trained Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05963.pdf)
> Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) define an exceptionally powerful class of models for image classification, but the theoretical background and the understanding of how invariances to certain transformations are learned is limited. In a large scale screening with images modified by different affine and nonaffine transformations of varying magnitude, we analyzed the behavior of the CNN architectures AlexNet and ResNet. If the magnitude of different transformations does not exceed a class- and transformation dependent threshold, both architectures show invariant behavior. In this work we furthermore introduce a new learnable module, the Invariant Transformer Net, which enables us to learn differentiable parameters for a set of affine transformations. This allows us to extract the space of transformations to which the CNN is invariant and its class prediction robust. 
### 272.Real-time Deep Pose Estimation with Geodesic Loss for Image-to-Template  Rigid Registration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05982.pdf)
> With an aim to increase the capture range and accelerate the performance of state-of-the-art inter-subject and subject-to-template 3D registration, we propose deep learning-based methods that are trained to find the 3D position of arbitrarily oriented subjects or anatomy based on slices or volumes of medical images. For this, we propose regression CNNs that learn to predict the angle-axis representation of 3D rotations and translations using image features. We use and compare mean square error and geodesic loss to train regression CNNs for 3D pose estimation used in two different scenarios: slice-to-volume registration and volume-to-volume registration. Our results show that in such registration applications that are amendable to learning, the proposed deep learning methods with geodesic loss minimization can achieve accurate results with a wide capture range in real-time (&lt;100ms). We also tested the generalization capability of the trained CNNs on an expanded age range and on images of newborn subjects with similar and different MR image contrasts. We trained our models on T2-weighted fetal brain MRI scans and used them to predict the 3D pose of newborn brains based on T1-weighted MRI scans. We showed that the trained models generalized well for the new domain when we performed image contrast transfer through a conditional generative adversarial network. This indicates that the domain of application of the trained deep regression CNNs can be further expanded to image modalities and contrasts other than those used in training. A combination of our proposed methods with accelerated optimization-based registration algorithms can dramatically enhance the performance of automatic imaging devices and image processing methods of the future. 
### 273.Deep Co-Training for Semi-Supervised Image Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05984.pdf)
> In this paper, we study the problem of semi-supervised image recognition, which is to learn classifiers using both labeled and unlabeled images. We present Deep Co-Training, a deep learning based method inspired by the Co-Training framework. The original Co-Training learns two classifiers on two views which are data from different sources that describe the same instances. To extend this concept to deep learning, Deep Co-Training trains multiple deep neural networks to be the different views and exploits adversarial examples to encourage view difference, in order to prevent the networks from collapsing into each other. As a result, the co-trained networks provide different and complementary information about the data, which is necessary for the Co-Training framework to achieve good results. We test our method on SVHN, CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets, and our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. 
### 274.Zero-Shot Object Detection: Learning to Simultaneously Recognize and  Localize Novel Concepts [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06049.pdf)
> Current Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) approaches are restricted to recognition of a single dominant unseen object category in a test image. We hypothesize that this setting is ill-suited for real-world applications where unseen objects appear only as a part of a complex scene, warranting both the `recognition' and `localization' of an unseen category. To address this limitation, we introduce a new \emph{`Zero-Shot Detection'} (ZSD) problem setting, which aims at simultaneously recognizing and locating object instances belonging to novel categories without any training examples. We also propose a new experimental protocol for ZSD based on the highly challenging ILSVRC dataset, adhering to practical issues, e.g., the rarity of unseen objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end deep network for ZSD that jointly models the interplay between visual and semantic domain information. To overcome the noise in the automatically derived semantic descriptions, we utilize the concept of meta-classes to design an original loss function that achieves synergy between max-margin class separation and semantic space clustering. Furthermore, we present a baseline approach extended from recognition to detection setting. Our extensive experiments show significant performance boost over the baseline on the imperative yet difficult ZSD problem. 
### 275.Deep Multiple Instance Learning for Zero-shot Image Tagging [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06051.pdf)
> In-line with the success of deep learning on traditional recognition problem, several end-to-end deep models for zero-shot recognition have been proposed in the literature. These models are successful to predict a single unseen label given an input image, but does not scale to cases where multiple unseen objects are present. In this paper, we model this problem within the framework of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first end-to-end trainable deep MIL framework for the multi-label zero-shot tagging problem. Due to its novel design, the proposed framework has several interesting features: (1) Unlike previous deep MIL models, it does not use any off-line procedure (e.g., Selective Search or EdgeBoxes) for bag generation. (2) During test time, it can process any number of unseen labels given their semantic embedding vectors. (3) Using only seen labels per image as weak annotation, it can produce a bounding box for each predicted labels. We experiment with the NUS-WIDE dataset and achieve superior performance across conventional, zero-shot and generalized zero-shot tagging tasks. 
### 276.Dynamic-structured Semantic Propagation Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06067.pdf)
> Semantic concept hierarchy is still under-explored for semantic segmentation due to the inefficiency and complicated optimization of incorporating structural inference into dense prediction. This lack of modeling semantic correlations also makes prior works must tune highly-specified models for each task due to the label discrepancy across datasets. It severely limits the generalization capability of segmentation models for open set concept vocabulary and annotation utilization. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic-Structured Semantic Propagation Network (DSSPN) that builds a semantic neuron graph by explicitly incorporating the semantic concept hierarchy into network construction. Each neuron represents the instantiated module for recognizing a specific type of entity such as a super-class (e.g. food) or a specific concept (e.g. pizza). During training, DSSPN performs the dynamic-structured neuron computation graph by only activating a sub-graph of neurons for each image in a principled way. A dense semantic-enhanced neural block is proposed to propagate the learned knowledge of all ancestor neurons into each fine-grained child neuron for feature evolving. Another merit of such semantic explainable structure is the ability of learning a unified model concurrently on diverse datasets by selectively activating different neuron sub-graphs for each annotation at each step. Extensive experiments on four public semantic segmentation datasets (i.e. ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, Cityscape and Mapillary) demonstrate the superiority of our DSSPN over state-of-the-art segmentation models. Moreoever, we demonstrate a universal segmentation model that is jointly trained on diverse datasets can surpass the performance of the common fine-tuning scheme for exploiting multiple domain knowledge. 
### 277.Real-time Detection, Tracking, and Classification of Moving and  Stationary Objects using Multiple Fisheye Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06077.pdf)
> The ability to detect pedestrians and other moving objects is crucial for an autonomous vehicle. This must be done in real-time with minimum system overhead. This paper discusses the implementation of a surround view system to identify moving as well as static objects that are close to the ego vehicle. The algorithm works on 4 views captured by fisheye cameras which are merged into a single frame. The moving object detection and tracking solution uses minimal system overhead to isolate regions of interest (ROIs) containing moving objects. These ROIs are then analyzed using a deep neural network (DNN) to categorize the moving object. With deployment and testing on a real car in urban environments, we have demonstrated the practical feasibility of the solution. The video demos of our algorithm have been uploaded to Youtube: <a href="https://youtu.be/vpoCfC724iA">this https URL</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/2X4aqH2bMBs">this https URL</a> 
### 278.Salient Objects in Clutter: Bringing Salient Object Detection to the  Foreground [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06091.pdf)
> We provide a comprehensive evaluation of salient object detection (SOD) models. Our analysis identifies a serious design bias of existing SOD datasets which assumes that each image contains at least one clearly outstanding salient object in low clutter. The design bias has led to a saturated high performance for state-of-the-art SOD models when evaluated on existing datasets. The models, however, still perform far from being satisfactory when applied to real-world daily scenes. Based on our analyses, we first identify 7 crucial aspects that a comprehensive and balanced dataset should fulfill. Then, we propose a new high quality dataset and update the previous saliency benchmark. Specifically, our SOC (Salient Objects in Clutter) dataset, includes images with salient and non-salient objects from daily object categories. Beyond object category annotations, each salient image is accompanied by attributes that reflect common challenges in real-world scenes. Finally, we report attribute-based performance assessment on our dataset. 
### 279.Varying k-Lipschitz Constraint for Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06107.pdf)
> Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful generative models, but suffer from training instability. The recent proposed Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) makes progress toward stable training. Gradient penalty acts as the role of enforcing a Lipschitz constraint. Further investigation on gradient penalty shows that gradient penalty may impose restriction on the capacity of discriminator. As a replacement, we introduce varying k-Lipschitz constraint. Proposed varying k-Lipschitz constraint witness better image quality and significantly improved training speed when testing on GAN architecture. Besides, we introduce an effective convergence measure, which correlates well with image quality. 
### 280.Towards Image Understanding from Deep Compression without Decoding [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06131.pdf)
> Motivated by recent work on deep neural network (DNN)-based image compression methods showing potential improvements in image quality, savings in storage, and bandwidth reduction, we propose to perform image understanding tasks such as classification and segmentation directly on the compressed representations produced by these compression methods. Since the encoders and decoders in DNN-based compression methods are neural networks with feature-maps as internal representations of the images, we directly integrate these with architectures for image understanding. This bypasses decoding of the compressed representation into RGB space and reduces computational cost. Our study shows that accuracies comparable to networks that operate on compressed RGB images can be achieved while reducing the computational complexity up to $2\times$. Furthermore, we show that synergies are obtained by jointly training compression networks with classification networks on the compressed representations, improving image quality, classification accuracy, and segmentation performance. We find that inference from compressed representations is particularly advantageous compared to inference from compressed RGB images for aggressive compression rates. 
### 281.Patchwise object tracking via structural local sparse appearance model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06141.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a robust visual tracking method which exploits the relationships of targets in adjacent frames using patchwise joint sparse representation. Two sets of overlapping patches with different sizes are extracted from target candidates to construct two dictionaries with consideration of joint sparse representation. By applying this representation into structural sparse appearance model, we can take two-fold advantages. First, the correlation of target patches over time is considered. Second, using this local appearance model with different patch sizes takes into account local features of target thoroughly. Furthermore, the position of candidate patches and their occlusion levels are utilized simultaneously to obtain the final likelihood of target candidates. Evaluations on recent challenging benchmark show that our tracking method outperforms the state-of-the-art trackers. 
### 282.Object Captioning and Retrieval with Natural Language [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06152.pdf)
> We address the problem of jointly learning vision and language to understand the object in a fine-grained manner. The key idea of our approach is the use of object descriptions to provide the detailed understanding of an object. Based on this idea, we propose two new architectures to solve two related problems: object captioning and natural language-based object retrieval. The goal of the object captioning task is to simultaneously detect the object and generate its associated description, while in the object retrieval task, the goal is to localize an object given an input query. We demonstrate that both problems can be solved effectively using hybrid end-to-end CNN-LSTM networks. The experimental results on our new challenging dataset show that our methods outperform recent methods by a fair margin, while providing a detailed understanding of the object and having fast inference time. The source code will be made available. 
### 283.Semantic Segmentation of Pathological Lung Tissue with Dilated Fully  Convolutional Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06167.pdf)
> Early and accurate diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) is crucial for making treatment decisions, but can be challenging even for experienced radiologists. The diagnostic procedure is based on the detection and recognition of the different ILD pathologies in thoracic CT scans, yet their manifestation often appears similar. In this study, we propose the use of a deep purely convolutional neural network for the semantic segmentation of ILD patterns, as the basic component of a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for ILDs. The proposed CNN, which consists of convolutional layers with dilated filters, takes as input a lung CT image of arbitrary size and outputs the corresponding label map. We trained and tested the network on a dataset of 172 sparsely annotated CT scans, within a cross-validation scheme. The training was performed in an end-to-end and semi-supervised fashion, utilizing both labeled and non-labeled image regions. The experimental results show significant performance improvement with respect to the state of the art. 
### 284.The ApolloScape Dataset for Autonomous Driving [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06184.pdf)
> Scene parsing aims to assign a class (semantic) label for each pixel in an image. It is a comprehensive analysis of an image. Given the rise of autonomous driving, pixel-accurate environmental perception is expected to be a key enabling technical piece. However, providing a large scale dataset for the design and evaluation of scene parsing algorithms, in particular for outdoor scenes, has been difficult. The per-pixel labelling process is prohibitively expensive, limiting the scale of existing ones. In this paper, we present a large-scale open dataset, ApolloScape, that consists of RGB videos and corresponding dense 3D point clouds. Comparing with existing datasets, our dataset has the following unique properties. The first is its scale, our initial release contains over 140K images - each with its per-pixel semantic mask, up to 1M is scheduled. The second is its complexity. Captured in various traffic conditions, the number of moving objects averages from tens to over one hundred. And the third is the 3D attribute, each image is tagged with high-accuracy pose information at cm accuracy and the static background point cloud has mm relative accuracy. We are able to label these many images by an interactive and efficient labelling pipeline that utilizes the high-quality 3D point cloud. Moreover, our dataset also contains different lane markings based on the lane colors and styles. We expect our new dataset can deeply benefit various autonomous driving related applications that include but not limited to 2D/3D scene understanding, localization, transfer learning, and driving simulation. 
### 285.Triplet-Center Loss for Multi-View 3D Object Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06189.pdf)
> Most existing 3D object recognition algorithms focus on leveraging the strong discriminative power of deep learning models with softmax loss for the classification of 3D data, while learning discriminative features with deep metric learning for 3D object retrieval is more or less neglected. In the paper, we study variants of deep metric learning losses for 3D object retrieval, which did not receive enough attention from this area. First , two kinds of representative losses, triplet loss and center loss, are introduced which could learn more discriminative features than traditional classification loss. Then, we propose a novel loss named triplet-center loss, which can further enhance the discriminative power of the features. The proposed triplet-center loss learns a center for each class and requires that the distances between samples and centers from the same class are closer than those from different classes. Extensive experimental results on two popular 3D object retrieval benchmarks and two widely-adopted sketch-based 3D shape retrieval benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed loss, and significant improvements have been achieved compared with the state-of-the-arts. 
### 286.Monocular Fisheye Camera Depth Estimation Using Semi-supervised Sparse  Velodyne Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06192.pdf)
> Near field depth estimation around a self driving car is an important function that can be achieved by four wide angle fisheye cameras having a field of view of over 180. CNN based depth estimation produce state of the art results, but progress is hindered because depth annotation cannot be obtained manually. Synthetic datasets are commonly used but they have limitations. For instance, they do not capture the extensive variability in the appearance of objects like vehicles present in real datasets. There is also a domain shift while performing inference on natural images illustrated by many attempts to handle the domain adaptation explicitly. In this work, we explore an alternate approach of training using sparse LIDAR data as ground truth for depth estimation for fisheye camera. We built our own dataset using our self\hyp driving car setup which has a 64 beam Velodyne LIDAR and four wide angle fisheye cameras. LIDAR data projected onto the image plane is sparse and hence viewed as semi supervision for dense depth estimation. To handle the difference in view points of LIDAR and fisheye camera, an occlusion resolution mechanism was implemented. We started with Eigen's multiscale convolutional network architecture and improved by modifying activation function and optimizer. We obtained promising results on our dataset with RMSE errors better than the state of the art results obtained on KITTI because of vast amounts of training data. Our model runs at 20 fps on an embedded platform Nvidia TX2. 
### 287.Complex-YOLO: Real-time 3D Object Detection on Point Clouds [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06199.pdf)
> Lidar based 3D object detection is inevitable for autonomous driving, because it directly links to environmental understanding and therefore builds the base for prediction and motion planning. The capacity of inferencing highly sparse 3D data in real-time is an ill-posed problem for lots of other application areas besides automated vehicles, e.g. augmented reality, personal robotics or industrial automation. We introduce Complex-YOLO, a state of the art real-time 3D object detection network on point clouds only. In this work, we describe a network that expands YOLOv2, a fast 2D standard object detector for RGB images, by a specific complex regression strategy to estimate multi-class 3D boxes in Cartesian space. Thus, we propose a specific Euler-Region-Proposal Network (E-RPN) to estimate the pose of the object by adding an imaginary and a real fraction to the regression network. This ends up in a closed complex space and avoids singularities, which occur by single angle estimations. The E-RPN supports to generalize well during training. Our experiments on the KITTI benchmark suite show that we outperform current leading methods for 3D object detection specifically in terms of efficiency. We achieve state of the art results for cars, pedestrians and cyclists by being more than five times faster than the fastest competitor. Further, our model is capable of estimating all eight KITTI-classes, including Vans, Trucks or sitting pedestrians simultaneously with high accuracy. 
### 288.Joint Recognition of Handwritten Text and Named Entities with a Neural  End-to-end Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06252.pdf)
> When extracting information from handwritten documents, text transcription and named entity recognition are usually faced as separate subsequent tasks. This has the disadvantage that errors in the first module affect heavily the performance of the second module. In this work we propose to do both tasks jointly, using a single neural network with a common architecture used for plain text recognition. Experimentally, the work has been tested on a collection of historical marriage records. Results of experiments are presented to show the effect on the performance for different configurations: different ways of encoding the information, doing or not transfer learning and processing at text line or multi-line region level. The results are comparable to state of the art reported in the ICDAR 2017 Information Extraction competition, even though the proposed technique does not use any dictionaries, language modeling or post processing. 
### 289.Land cover mapping at very high resolution with rotation equivariant  CNNs: towards small yet accurate models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06253.pdf)
> In remote sensing images, the absolute orientation of objects is arbitrary. Depending on an object's orientation and on a sensor's flight path, objects of the same semantic class can be observed in different orientations in the same image. Equivariance to rotation, in this context understood as responding with a rotated semantic label map when subject to a rotation of the input image, is therefore a very desirable feature, in particular for high capacity models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). If rotation equivariance is encoded in the network, the model is confronted with a simpler task and does not need to learn specific (and redundant) weights to address rotated versions of the same object class. In this work we propose a CNN architecture called Rotation Equivariant Vector Field Network (RotEqNet) to encode rotation equivariance in the network itself. By using rotating convolutions as building blocks and passing only the the values corresponding to the maximally activating orientation throughout the network in the form of orientation encoding vector fields, RotEqNet treats rotated versions of the same object with the same filter bank and therefore achieves state-of-the-art performances even when using very small architectures trained from scratch. We test RotEqNet in two challenging sub-decimeter resolution semantic labeling problems, and show that we can perform better than a standard CNN while requiring one order of magnitude less parameters. 
### 290.Improved Part Segmentation Performance by Optimising Realism of  Synthetic Images using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06301.pdf)
> In this paper we report on improved part segmentation performance using convolutional neural networks to reduce the dependency on the large amount of manually annotated empirical images. This was achieved by optimising the visual realism of synthetic agricultural images.In Part I, a cycle consistent generative adversarial network was applied to synthetic and empirical images with the objective to generate more realistic synthetic images by translating them to the empirical domain. We first hypothesise and confirm that plant part image features such as color and texture become more similar to the empirical domain after translation of the synthetic images.Results confirm this with an improved mean color distribution correlation with the empirical data prior of 0.62 and post translation of 0.90. Furthermore, the mean image features of contrast, homogeneity, energy and entropy moved closer to the empirical mean, post translation. In Part II, 7 experiments were performed using convolutional neural networks with different combinations of synthetic, synthetic translated to empirical and empirical images. We hypothesised that the translated images can be used for (i) improved learning of empirical images, and (ii) that learning without any fine-tuning with empirical images is improved by bootstrapping with translated images over bootstrapping with synthetic images. Results confirm our second and third hypotheses. First a maximum intersection-over-union performance was achieved of 0.52 when bootstrapping with translated images and fine-tuning with empirical images; an 8% increase compared to only using synthetic images. Second, training without any empirical fine-tuning resulted in an average IOU of 0.31; a 55% performance increase over previous methods that only used synthetic images. 
### 291.EVA$^2$: Exploiting Temporal Redundancy in Live Computer Vision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06312.pdf)
> Hardware support for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is critical to advanced computer vision in mobile and embedded devices. Current designs, however, accelerate generic CNNs; they do not exploit the unique characteristics of real-time vision. We propose to use the temporal redundancy in natural video to avoid unnecessary computation on most frames. A new algorithm, activation motion compensation, detects changes in the visual input and incrementally updates a previously-computed output. The technique takes inspiration from video compression and applies well-known motion estimation techniques to adapt to visual changes. We use an adaptive key frame rate to control the trade-off between efficiency and vision quality as the input changes. We implement the technique in hardware as an extension to existing state-of-the-art CNN accelerator designs. The new unit reduces the average energy per frame by 54.2%, 61.7%, and 87.6% for three CNNs with less than 1% loss in vision accuracy. 
### 292.Activity Detection with Latent Sub-event Hierarchy Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06316.pdf)
> In this paper, we introduce a new convolutional layer named the Temporal Gaussian Mixture (TGM) layer and present how it can be used to efficiently capture temporal structure in continuous activity videos. Our layer is designed to allow the model to learn a latent hierarchy of sub-event intervals. Our approach is fully differentiable while relying on a significantly less number of parameters, enabling its end-to-end training with standard backpropagation. We present our convolutional video models with multiple TGM layers for activity detection. Our experiments on multiple datasets including Charades and MultiTHUMOS confirm the benefit of our TGM layers, illustrating that it outperforms other models and temporal convolutions. 
### 293.Synchronisation of Partial Multi-Matchings via Non-negative  Factorisations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06320.pdf)
> In this work we study permutation synchronisation for the challenging case of partial permutations, which plays an important role for the problem of matching multiple objects (e.g. images or shapes). The term synchronisation refers to the property that the set of pairwise matchings is cycle-consistent, i.e. in the full matching case all compositions of pairwise matchings over cycles must be equal to the identity. Motivated by clustering and matrix factorisation perspectives of cycle-consistency, we derive an algorithm to tackle the permutation synchronisation problem based on non-negative factorisations. In order to deal with the inherent non-convexity of the permutation synchronisation problem, we use an initialisation procedure based on a novel rotation scheme applied to the solution of the spectral relaxation. Moreover, this rotation scheme facilitates a convenient Euclidean projection to obtain a binary solution after solving our relaxed problem. In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, our approach is guaranteed to produce cycle-consistent results. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of our method and show that it achieves better results compared to existing methods. 
### 294.Learning deep structured active contours end-to-end [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06329.pdf)
> The world is covered with millions of buildings, and precisely knowing each instance's position and extents is vital to a multitude of applications. Recently, automated building footprint segmentation models have shown superior detection accuracy thanks to the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, even the latest evolutions struggle to precisely delineating borders, which often leads to geometric distortions and inadvertent fusion of adjacent building instances. We propose to overcome this issue by exploiting the distinct geometric properties of buildings. To this end, we present Deep Structured Active Contours (DSAC), a novel framework that integrates priors and constraints into the segmentation process, such as continuous boundaries, smooth edges, and sharp corners. To do so, DSAC employs Active Contour Models (ACM), a family of constraint- and prior-based polygonal models. We learn ACM parameterizations per instance using a CNN, and show how to incorporate all components in a structured output model, making DSAC trainable end-to-end. We evaluate DSAC on three challenging building instance segmentation datasets, where it compares favorably against state-of-the-art. Code will be made available. 
### 295.Faces as Lighting Probes via Unsupervised Deep Highlight Extraction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06340.pdf)
> We present a method for estimating detailed scene illumination using human faces in a single image. In contrast to previous works that estimate lighting in terms of low-order basis functions or distant point lights, our technique estimates illumination at a higher precision in the form of a non-parametric environment map. Based on the observation that faces can exhibit strong highlight reflections from a broad range of lighting directions, we propose a deep neural network for extracting highlights from faces, and then trace these reflections back to the scene to acquire the environment map. Since real training data for highlight extraction is very limited, we introduce an unsupervised scheme for finetuning the network on real images, based on the consistent diffuse chromaticity of a given face seen in multiple real images. In tracing the estimated highlights to the environment, we reduce the blurring effect of skin reflectance on reflected light through a deconvolution determined by prior knowledge on face material properties. Comparisons to previous techniques for highlight extraction and illumination estimation show the state-of-the-art performance of this approach on a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes. 
### 296.A Low-rank Tensor Regularization Strategy for Hyperspectral Unmixing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06355.pdf)
> Tensor-based methods have recently emerged as a more natural and effective formulation to address many problems in hyperspectral imaging. In hyperspectral unmixing (HU), low-rank constraints on the abundance maps have been shown to act as a regularization which adequately accounts for the multidimensional structure of the underlying signal. However, imposing a strict low-rank constraint for the abundance maps does not seem to be adequate, as important information that may be required to represent fine scale abundance behavior may be discarded. This paper introduces a new low-rank tensor regularization that adequately captures the low-rank structure underlying the abundance maps without hindering the flexibility of the solution. Simulation results with synthetic and real data show that the the extra flexibility introduced by the proposed regularization significantly improves the unmixing results. 
### 297.Learning to Segment via Cut-and-Paste [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06414.pdf)
> This paper presents a weakly-supervised approach to object instance segmentation. Starting with known or predicted object bounding boxes, we learn object masks by playing a game of cut-and-paste in an adversarial learning setup. A mask generator takes a detection box and Faster R-CNN features, and constructs a segmentation mask that is used to cut-and-paste the object into a new image location. The discriminator tries to distinguish between real objects, and those cut and pasted via the generator, giving a learning signal that leads to improved object masks. We verify our method experimentally using Cityscapes, COCO, and aerial image datasets, learning to segment objects without ever having seen a mask in training. Our method exceeds the performance of existing weakly supervised methods, without requiring hand-tuned segment proposals, and reaches 90% of supervised performance. 
### 298.Learning to Cluster for Proposal-Free Instance Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06459.pdf)
> This work proposed a novel learning objective to train a deep neural network to perform end-to-end image pixel clustering. We applied the approach to instance segmentation, which is at the intersection of image semantic segmentation and object detection. We utilize the most fundamental property of instance labeling -- the pairwise relationship between pixels -- as the supervision to formulate the learning objective, then apply it to train a fully convolutional network (FCN) for learning to perform pixel-wise clustering. The resulting clusters can be used as the instance labeling directly. To support labeling of an unlimited number of instance, we further formulate ideas from graph coloring theory into the proposed learning objective. The evaluation on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrates strong performance and therefore proof of the concept. Moreover, our approach won the second place in the lane detection competition of 2017 CVPR Autonomous Driving Challenge, and was the top performer without using external data. 
### 299.Queuing Theory Guided Intelligent Traffic Scheduling through Video  Analysis using Dirichlet Process Mixture Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06480.pdf)
> Accurate prediction of traffic signal duration for roadway junction is a challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of traffic flows. Though supervised learning can be used, parameters may vary across roadway junctions. In this paper, we present a computer vision guided expert system that can learn the departure rate of a given traffic junction modeled using traditional queuing theory. First, we temporally group the optical flow of the moving vehicles using Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). These groups are referred to as tracklets or temporal clusters. Tracklet features are then used to learn the dynamic behavior of a traffic junction, especially during on/off cycles of a signal. The proposed queuing theory based approach can predict the signal open duration for the next cycle with higher accuracy when compared with other popular features used for tracking. The hypothesis has been verified on two publicly available video datasets. The results reveal that the DPMM based features are better than existing tracking frameworks to estimate $\mu$. Thus, signal duration prediction is more accurate when tested on these datasets.The method can be used for designing intelligent operator-independent traffic control systems for roadway junctions at cities and highways. 
### 300.Robust event-stream pattern tracking based on correlative filter [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06490.pdf)
> Object tracking based on retina-inspired and event-based dynamic vision sensor (DVS) is challenging for the noise events, rapid change of event-stream shape, chaos of complex background textures, and occlusion. To address these challenges, this paper presents a robust event-stream pattern tracking method based on correlative filter mechanism. In the proposed method, rate coding is used to encode the event-stream object in each segment. Feature representations from hierarchical convolutional layers of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) are used to represent the appearance of the rate encoded event-stream object. The results prove that our method not only achieves good tracking performance in many complicated scenes with noise events, complex background textures, occlusion, and intersected trajectories, but also is robust to variable scale, variable pose, and non-rigid deformations. In addition, this correlative filter based event-stream tracking has the advantage of high speed. The proposed approach will promote the potential applications of these event-based vision sensors in self-driving, robots and many other high-speed scenes. 
### 301.Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection Using Image Labels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06503.pdf)
> Deep learning based salient object detection has recently achieved great success with its performance greatly outperforms any other unsupervised methods. However, annotating per-pixel saliency masks is a tedious and inefficient procedure. In this paper, we note that superior salient object detection can be obtained by iteratively mining and correcting the labeling ambiguity on saliency maps from traditional unsupervised methods. We propose to use the combination of a coarse salient object activation map from the classification network and saliency maps generated from unsupervised methods as pixel-level annotation, and develop a simple yet very effective algorithm to train fully convolutional networks for salient object detection supervised by these noisy annotations. Our algorithm is based on alternately exploiting a graphical model and training a fully convolutional network for model updating. The graphical model corrects the internal labeling ambiguity through spatial consistency and structure preserving while the fully convolutional network helps to correct the cross-image semantic ambiguity and simultaneously update the coarse activation map for next iteration. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method greatly outperforms all state-of-the-art unsupervised saliency detection methods and can be comparable to the current best strongly-supervised methods training with thousands of pixel-level saliency map annotations on all public benchmarks. 
### 302.Learning Unsupervised Visual Grounding Through Semantic Self-Supervision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06506.pdf)
> Localizing natural language phrases in images is a challenging problem that requires joint understanding of both the textual and visual modalities. In the unsupervised setting, lack of supervisory signals exacerbate this difficulty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised visual grounding which uses concept learning as a proxy task to obtain self-supervision. The simple intuition behind this idea is to encourage the model to localize to regions which can explain some semantic property in the data, in our case, the property being the presence of a concept in a set of images. We present thorough quantitative and qualitative experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and show a 5.6% improvement over the current state of the art on Visual Genome dataset, a 5.8% improvement on the ReferItGame dataset and comparable to state-of-art performance on the Flickr30k dataset. 
### 303.MergeNet: A Deep Net Architecture for Small Obstacle Discovery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06508.pdf)
> We present here, a novel network architecture called MergeNet for discovering small obstacles for on-road scenes in the context of autonomous driving. The basis of the architecture rests on the central consideration of training with less amount of data since the physical setup and the annotation process for small obstacles is hard to scale. For making effective use of the limited data, we propose a multi-stage training procedure involving weight-sharing, separate learning of low and high level features from the RGBD input and a refining stage which learns to fuse the obtained complementary features. The model is trained and evaluated on the Lost and Found dataset and is able to achieve state-of-art results with just 135 images in comparison to the 1000 images used by the previous benchmark. Additionally, we also compare our results with recent methods trained on 6000 images and show that our method achieves comparable performance with only 1000 training samples. 
### 304.SeqFace: Make full use of sequence information for face recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06524.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have greatly improved the Face Recognition (FR) performance in recent years. Almost all CNNs in FR are trained on the carefully labeled datasets containing plenty of identities. However, such high-quality datasets are very expensive to collect, which restricts many researchers to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we propose a framework, called SeqFace, for learning discriminative face features. Besides a traditional identity training dataset, the designed SeqFace can train CNNs by using an additional dataset which includes a large number of face sequences collected from videos. Moreover, the label smoothing regularization (LSR) and a new proposed discriminative sequence agent (DSA) loss are employed to enhance discrimination power of deep face features via making full use of the sequence data. Our method achieves excellent performance on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), YouTube Faces (YTF), only with a single ResNet. The code and models are publicly available on-line (<a href="https://github.com/huangyangyu/SeqFace">this https URL</a>). 
### 305.Adaptive strategy for superpixel-based region-growing image segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06541.pdf)
> This work presents a region-growing image segmentation approach based on superpixel decomposition. From an initial contour-constrained over-segmentation of the input image, the image segmentation is achieved by iteratively merging similar superpixels into regions. This approach raises two key issues: (1) how to compute the similarity between superpixels in order to perform accurate merging and (2) in which order those superpixels must be merged together. In this perspective, we firstly introduce a robust adaptive multi-scale superpixel similarity in which region comparisons are made both at content and common border level. Secondly, we propose a global merging strategy to efficiently guide the region merging process. Such strategy uses an adpative merging criterion to ensure that best region aggregations are given highest priorities. This allows to reach a final segmentation into consistent regions with strong boundary adherence. We perform experiments on the BSDS500 image dataset to highlight to which extent our method compares favorably against other well-known image segmentation algorithms. The obtained results demonstrate the promising potential of the proposed approach. 
### 306.Convolutional Point-set Representation: A Convolutional Bridge Between a  Densely Annotated Image and 3D Face Alignment [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06542.pdf)
> We present a robust method for estimating the facial pose and shape information from a densely annotated facial image. The method relies on Convolutional Point-set Representation (CPR), a carefully designed matrix representation to summarize different layers of information encoded in the set of detected points in the annotated image. The CPR disentangles the dependencies of shape and different pose parameters and enables updating different parameters in a sequential manner via convolutional neural networks and recurrent layers. When updating the pose parameters, we sample reprojection errors along with a predicted direction and update the parameters based on the pattern of reprojection errors. This technique boosts the model's capability in searching a local minimum under challenging scenarios. We also demonstrate that annotation from different sources can be merged under the framework of CPR and contributes to outperforming the current state-of-the-art solutions for 3D face alignment. Experiments indicate the proposed CPRFA (CPR-based Face Alignment) significantly improves 3D alignment accuracy when the densely annotated image contains noise and missing values, which is common under "in-the-wild" acquisition scenarios. 
### 307.Fusion of an Ensemble of Augmented Image Detectors for Robust Object  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06554.pdf)
> A significant challenge in object detection is accurate identification of an object's position in image space, whereas one algorithm with one set of parameters is usually not enough, and the fusion of multiple algorithms and/or parameters can lead to more robust results. Herein, a new computational intelligence fusion approach based on the dynamic analysis of agreement among object detection outputs is proposed. Furthermore, we propose an online versus just in training image augmentation strategy. Experiments comparing the results both with and without fusion are presented. We demonstrate that the augmented and fused combination results are the best, with respect to higher accuracy rates and reduction of outlier influences. The approach is demonstrated in the context of cone, pedestrian and box detection for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) applications. 
### 308.A Multi-perspective Approach To Anomaly Detection For Self-aware  Embodied Agents [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06579.pdf)
> This paper focuses on multi-sensor anomaly detection for moving cognitive agents using both external and private first-person visual observations. Both observation types are used to characterize agents' motion in a given environment. The proposed method generates locally uniform motion models by dividing a Gaussian process that approximates agents' displacements on the scene and provides a Shared Level (SL) self-awareness based on Environment Centered (EC) models. Such models are then used to train in a semi-unsupervised way a set of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that produce an estimation of external and internal parameters of moving agents. Obtained results exemplify the feasibility of using multi-perspective data for predicting and analyzing trajectory information. 
### 309.Efficient and accurate inversion of multiple scattering with deep  learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06594.pdf)
> Image reconstruction under multiple light scattering is crucial in a number of applications such as diffraction tomography. The reconstruction problem is often formulated as a nonconvex optimization, where a nonlinear measurement model is used to account for multiple scattering and regularization is used to enforce prior constraints on the object. In this paper, we propose a powerful alternative to this optimization-based view of image reconstruction by designing and training a deep convolutional neural network that can invert multiple scattered measurements to produce a high-quality image of the refractive index. Our results on both simulated and experimental datasets show that the proposed approach is substantially faster and achieves higher imaging quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods based on optimization. 
### 310.Facial Landmarks Detection by Self-Iterative Regression based  Landmarks-Attention Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06598.pdf)
> Cascaded Regression (CR) based methods have been proposed to solve facial landmarks detection problem, which learn a series of descent directions by multiple cascaded regressors separately trained in coarse and fine stages. They outperform the traditional gradient descent based methods in both accuracy and running speed. However, cascaded regression is not robust enough because each regressor's training data comes from the output of previous regressor. Moreover, training multiple regressors requires lots of computing resources, especially for deep learning based methods. In this paper, we develop a Self-Iterative Regression (SIR) framework to improve the model efficiency. Only one self-iterative regressor is trained to learn the descent directions for samples from coarse stages to fine stages, and parameters are iteratively updated by the same regressor. Specifically, we proposed Landmarks-Attention Network (LAN) as our regressor, which concurrently learns features around each landmark and obtains the holistic location increment. By doing so, not only the rest of regressors are removed to simplify the training process, but the number of model parameters is significantly decreased. The experiments demonstrate that with only 3.72M model parameters, our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance. 
### 311.Dynamic Trajectory Model for Analysis of Traffic States using DPMM [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06613.pdf)
> Appropriate modeling of a surveillance scene is essential while analyzing and detecting anomalies in road traffic. Learning usual paths can provide much insight into road traffic situation and to identify abnormal routes taken by commuters/vehicles in a traffic scene. If usual traffic paths are learned in a nonparametric way, manual effort of marking the roads can be avoided. We propose an unsupervised and nonparametric method to learn frequently used paths from the tracks of moving objects in $\Theta(kn)$ time, where $k$ is the number of paths and $n$ represents the number of tracks. In the proposed method, temporal correlation of the moving objects is taken into consideration to make the clustering meaningful using Temporally Incremental Gravity Model-Dynamic Trajectory Model (TIGM-DTM). In addition, the scene learning is based on distance, thus making it realistically intuitive in estimating the model parameters. Experimental validation reveals that the proposed method can learn a scene quickly without knowing the number of paths ($k$). We have compared the results with mean shift and DBSCAN. Further, we extend the model to represent states of a scene that can be used for taking timely actions. We have applied the model to understand its effectiveness in other domain. 
### 312.The Automatic Identification of Butterfly Species [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06626.pdf)
> The available butterfly data sets comprise a few limited species, and the images in the data sets are always standard patterns without the images of butterflies in their living environment. To overcome the aforementioned limitations in the butterfly data sets, we build a butterfly data set composed of all species of butterflies in China with 4270 standard pattern images of 1176 butterfly species, and 1425 images from living environment of 111 species. We propose to use the deep learning technique Faster-Rcnn to train an automatic butterfly identification system including butterfly position detection and species recognition. We delete those species with only one living environment image from data set, then partition the rest images from living environment into two subsets, one used as test subset, the other as training subset respectively combined with all standard pattern butterfly images or the standard pattern butterfly images with the same species of the images from living environment. In order to construct the training subset for FasterRcnn, nine methods were adopted to amplifying the images in the training subset including the turning of up and down, and left and right, rotation with different angles, adding noises, blurring, and contrast ratio adjusting etc. Three prediction models were trained. The mAP (Mean Average prediction) criterion was used to evaluate the performance of the prediction model. The experimental results demonstrate that our Faster-Rcnn based butterfly automatic identification system performed well, and its worst mAP is up to 60%, and can simultaneously detect the positions of more than one butterflies in one images from living environment and recognize the species of those butterflies as well. 
### 313.Cross-modality image synthesis from unpaired data using CycleGAN:  Effects of gradient consistency loss and training data size [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06629.pdf)
> CT is commonly used in orthopedic procedures. MRI is used along with CT to identify muscle structures and diagnose osteonecrosis due to its superior soft tissue contrast. However, MRI has poor contrast for bone structures. Clearly, it would be helpful if a corresponding CT were available, as bone boundaries are more clearly seen and CT has standardized (i.e., Hounsfield) units. Therefore, we aim at MR-to-CT synthesis. The CycleGAN was successfully applied to unpaired CT and MR images of the head, these images do not have as much variation of intensity pairs as do images in the pelvic region due to the presence of joints and muscles. In this paper, we extended the CycleGAN approach by adding the gradient consistency loss to improve the accuracy at the boundaries. We conducted two experiments. To evaluate image synthesis, we investigated dependency of image synthesis accuracy on 1) the number of training data and 2) the gradient consistency loss. To demonstrate the applicability of our method, we also investigated a segmentation accuracy on synthesized images. 
### 314.Zoom and Learn: Generalizing Deep Stereo Matching to Novel Domains [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06641.pdf)
> Despite the recent success of stereo matching with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it remains arduous to generalize a pre-trained deep stereo model to a novel domain. A major difficulty is to collect accurate ground-truth disparities for stereo pairs in the target domain. In this work, we propose a self-adaptation approach for CNN training, utilizing both synthetic training data (with ground-truth disparities) and stereo pairs in the new domain (without ground-truths). Our method is driven by two empirical observations. By feeding real stereo pairs of different domains to stereo models pre-trained with synthetic data, we see that: i) a pre-trained model does not generalize well to the new domain, producing artifacts at boundaries and ill-posed regions; however, ii) feeding an up-sampled stereo pair leads to a disparity map with extra details. To avoid i) while exploiting ii), we formulate an iterative optimization problem with graph Laplacian regularization. At each iteration, the CNN adapts itself better to the new domain: we let the CNN learn its own higher-resolution output; at the meanwhile, a graph Laplacian regularization is imposed to discriminatively keep the desired edges while smoothing out the artifacts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in two domains: daily scenes collected by smartphone cameras, and street views captured in a driving car. 
### 315.Line Artist: A Multiple Style Sketch to Painting Synthesis Scheme [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06647.pdf)
> Drawing a beautiful painting is a dream of many people since childhood. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, Line Artist, to synthesize artistic style paintings with freehand sketch images, leveraging the power of deep learning and advanced algorithms. Our scheme includes three models. The Sketch Image Extraction (SIE) model is applied to generate the training data. It includes smoothing reality images and pencil sketch extraction. The Detailed Image Synthesis (DIS) model trains a conditional generative adversarial network to generate detailed real-world information. The Adaptively Weighted Artistic Style Transfer (AWAST) model is capable to combine multiple style images with a content with the VGG19 network and PageRank algorithm. The appealing artistic images are then generated by optimization iterations. Experiments are operated on the Kaggle Cats dataset and The Oxford Buildings Dataset. Our synthesis results are proved to be artistic, beautiful and robust. 
### 316.Ratio-Preserving Half-Cylindrical Warps for Natural Image Stitching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06655.pdf)
> A novel warp for natural image stitching is proposed that utilizes the property of cylindrical warp and a horizontal pixel selection strategy. The proposed ratio-preserving half-cylindrical warp is a combination of homography and cylindrical warps which guarantees alignment by homography and possesses less projective distortion by cylindrical warp. Unlike previous approaches applying cylindrical warp before homography, we use partition lines to divide the image into different parts and apply homography in the overlapping region while a composition of homography and cylindrical warps in the non-overlapping region. The pixel selection strategy then samples the points in horizontal and reconstructs the image via interpolation to further reduce horizontal distortion by maintaining the ratio as similarity. With applying half-cylindrical warp and horizontal pixel selection, the projective distortion in vertical and horizontal is mitigated simultaneously. Experiments show that our warp is efficient and produces a more natural-looking stitched result than previous methods. 
### 317.Sdf-GAN: Semi-supervised Depth Fusion with Multi-scale Adversarial  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06657.pdf)
> Fusing disparity maps from different algorithms to exploit their complementary advantages is still challenging. Uncertainty estimation and complex disparity relationships between neighboring pixels limit the accuracy and robustness of the existing methods and there is no common method for depth fusion of different kind of data. In this paper, we introduce a method to incorporate supplementary information (intensity, gradient constraints etc.) into a Generative Adversarial Network to better refine each input disparity value. By adopting a multi-scale strategy, the disparity relationship in the fused disparity map is a better estimate of the real distribution. The approach includes a more robust object function to avoid blurry edges, impaints invalid disparity values and requires much fewer ground data to train. The algorithm can be generalized to different kinds of depth fusion. The experiments were conducted through simulation and real data, exploring different fusion opportunities: stereo-monocular fusion from coarse input, stereo-stereo fusion from moderately accurate input, fusion from accurate binocular input and Time of Flight sensor. The experiments show the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with the most recent algorithms on the public Scene Flow and SYNTH3 datasets. The code is available from <a href="https://github.com/Canpu999">this https URL</a> 
### 318.Discriminative Learning of Latent Features for Zero-Shot Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06731.pdf)
> Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen image categories by learning an embedding space between image and semantic representations. For years, among existing works, it has been the center task to learn the proper mapping matrices aligning the visual and semantic space, whilst the importance to learn discriminative representations for ZSL is ignored. In this work, we retrospect existing methods and demonstrate the necessity to learn discriminative representations for both visual and semantic instances of ZSL. We propose an end-to-end network that is capable of 1) automatically discovering discriminative regions by a zoom network; and 2) learning discriminative semantic representations in an augmented space introduced for both user-defined and latent attributes. Our proposed method is tested extensively on two challenging ZSL datasets, and the experiment results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. 
### 319.White matter hyperintensity segmentation from T1 and FLAIR images using  fully convolutional neural networks enhanced with residual connections [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06782.pdf)
> Segmentation and quantification of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are of great importance in studying and understanding various neurological and geriatric disorders. Although automatic methods have been proposed for WMH segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), manual corrections are often necessary to achieve clinically practical results. Major challenges for WMH segmentation stem from their inhomogeneous MRI intensities, random location and size distributions, and MRI noise. The presence of other brain anatomies or diseases with enhanced intensities adds further difficulties. To cope with these challenges, we present a specifically designed fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with residual connections to segment WMHs by using combined T1 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Our customized FCN is designed to be straightforward and generalizable, providing efficient end-to-end training due to its enhanced information propagation. We tested our method on the open WMH Segmentation Challenge MICCAI2017 dataset, and, despite our method's relative simplicity, results show that it performs amongst the leading techniques across five metrics. More importantly, our method achieves the best score for hausdorff distance and average volume difference in testing datasets from two MRI scanners that were not included in training, demonstrating better generalization ability of our proposed method over its competitors. 
### 320.TOMAAT: volumetric medical image analysis as a cloud service [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06784.pdf)
> Deep learning has been recently applied to a multitude of computer vision and medical image analysis problems. Although recent research efforts have improved the state of the art, most of the methods cannot be easily accessed, compared or used by either researchers or the general public. Researchers often publish their code and trained models on the internet, but this does not always enable these approaches to be easily used or integrated in stand-alone applications and existing workflows. In this paper we propose a framework which allows easy deployment and access of deep learning methods for segmentation through a cloud-based architecture. Our approach comprises three parts: a server, which wraps trained deep learning models and their pre- and post-processing data pipelines and makes them available on the cloud; a client which interfaces with the server to obtain predictions on user data; a service registry that informs clients about available prediction endpoints that are available in the cloud. These three parts constitute the open-source TOMAAT framework. 
### 321.Depth-aware CNN for RGB-D Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06791.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are limited by the lack of capability to handle geometric information due to the fixed grid kernel structure. The availability of depth data enables progress in RGB-D semantic segmentation with CNNs. State-of-the-art methods either use depth as additional images or process spatial information in 3D volumes or point clouds. These methods suffer from high computation and memory cost. To address these issues, we present Depth-aware CNN by introducing two intuitive, flexible and effective operations: depth-aware convolution and depth-aware average pooling. By leveraging depth similarity between pixels in the process of information propagation, geometry is seamlessly incorporated into CNN. Without introducing any additional parameters, both operators can be easily integrated into existing CNNs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on challenging RGB-D semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach. 
### 322.Nonlocal Low-Rank Tensor Factor Analysis for Image Restoration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06795.pdf)
> Low-rank signal modeling has been widely leveraged to capture non-local correlation in image processing applications. We propose a new method that employs low-rank tensor factor analysis for tensors generated by grouped image patches. The low-rank tensors are fed into the alternative direction multiplier method (ADMM) to further improve image reconstruction. The motivating application is compressive sensing (CS), and a deep convolutional architecture is adopted to approximate the expensive matrix inversion in CS applications. An iterative algorithm based on this low-rank tensor factorization strategy, called NLR-TFA, is presented in detail. Experimental results on noiseless and noisy CS measurements demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, especially at low CS sampling rates. 
### 323.Attention-GAN for Object Transfiguration in Wild Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06798.pdf)
> This paper studies the object transfiguration problem in wild images. The generative network in classical GANs for object transfiguration often undertakes a dual responsibility: to detect the objects of interests and to convert the object from source domain to target domain. In contrast, we decompose the generative network into two separat networks, each of which is only dedicated to one particular sub-task. The attention network predicts spatial attention maps of images, and the transformation network focuses on translating objects. Attention maps produced by attention network are encouraged to be sparse, so that major attention can be paid to objects of interests. No matter before or after object transfiguration, attention maps should remain constant. In addition, learning attention network can receive more instructions, given the available segmentation annotations of images. Experimental results demonstrate the necessity of investigating attention in object transfiguration, and that the proposed algorithm can learn accurate attention to improve quality of generated images. 
### 324.Revisiting RCNN: On Awakening the Classification Power of Faster RCNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06799.pdf)
> Recent region-based object detectors are usually built with separate classification and localization branches on top of shared feature extraction networks. In this paper, we analyze failure cases of state-of-the-art detectors and observe that most hard false positives result from classification instead of localization. We conjecture that: (1) Shared feature representation is not optimal due to the mismatched goals of feature learning for classification and localization; (2) multi-task learning helps, yet optimization of the multi-task loss may result in sub-optimal for individual tasks; (3) large receptive field for different scales leads to redundant context information for small objects.We demonstrate the potential of detector classification power by a simple, effective, and widely-applicable Decoupled Classification Refinement (DCR) network. DCR samples hard false positives from the base classifier in Faster RCNN and trains a RCNN-styled strong classifier. Experiments show new state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC and COCO without any bells and whistles. 
### 325.Alive Caricature from 2D to 3D [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06802.pdf)
> Caricature is an art form that expresses subjects in abstract, simple and exaggerated view. While many caricatures are 2D images, this paper presents an algorithm for creating expressive 3D caricatures from 2D caricature images with a minimum of user interaction. The key idea of our approach is to introduce an intrinsic deformation representation that has a capacity of extrapolation enabling us to create a deformation space from standard face dataset, which maintains face constraints and meanwhile is sufficiently large for producing exaggerated face models. Built upon the proposed deformation representation, an optimization model is formulated to find the 3D caricature that captures the style of the 2D caricature image automatically. The experiments show that our approach has better capability in expressing caricatures than those fitting approaches directly using classical parametric face models such as 3DMM and FaceWareHouse. Moreover, our approach is based on standard face datasets and avoids constructing complicated 3D caricature training set, which provides great flexibility in real applications. 
### 326.Weakly Supervised Object Localization on grocery shelves using simple  FCN and Synthetic Dataset [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06813.pdf)
> We propose a weakly supervised method using two algorithms to predict object bounding boxes given only an image classification dataset. First algorithm is a simple Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) trained to classify object instances. We use the property of FCN to return a mask for images larger than training images to get a primary output segmentation mask during test time by passing an image pyramid to it. We enhance the FCN output mask into final output bounding boxes by a Convolutional Encoder-Decoder (ConvAE) viz. the second algorithm. ConvAE is trained to localize objects on an artificially generated dataset of output segmentation masks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in localizing objects in grocery shelves where annotating data for object detection is hard due to variety of objects. This method can be extended to any problem domain where collecting images of objects is easy and annotating their coordinates is hard. 
### 327.ESPNet: Efficient Spatial Pyramid of Dilated Convolutions for Semantic  Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06815.pdf)
> We introduce a fast and efficient convolutional neural network, ESPNet, for semantic segmentation of high resolution images under resource constraints. ESPNet is based on a new convolutional module, efficient spatial pyramid (ESP), which is efficient in terms of computation, memory, and power. ESPNet is 22 times faster (on a standard GPU) and 180 times smaller than the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation network PSPNet, while its category-wise accuracy is only 8% less. We evaluated ESPNet on a variety of semantic segmentation datasets including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and a breast biopsy whole slide image dataset. Under the same constraints on memory and computation, ESPNet outperforms all the current efficient CNN networks such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and ENet on both standard metrics and our newly introduced performance metrics that measure efficiency on edge devices. Our network can process high resolution images at a rate of 112 and 9 frames per second on a standard GPU and edge device, respectively. 
### 328.A Mixture of Views Network with Applications to the Classification of  Breast Microcalcifications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06898.pdf)
> In this paper we examine data fusion methods for multi-view data classification. We present a decision concept which explicitly takes into account the input multi-view structure, where for each case there is a different subset of relevant views. This data fusion concept, which we dub Mixture of Views, is implemented by a special purpose neural network architecture. It is demonstrated on the task of classifying breast microcalcifications as benign or malignant based on CC and MLO mammography views. The single view decisions are combined by a data-driven decision, according to the relevance of each view in a given case, into a global decision. The method is evaluated on a large multi-view dataset extracted from the standardized digital database for screening mammography (DDSM). The experimental results show that our method outperforms previously suggested fusion methods. 
### 329.Aerial LaneNet: Lane Marking Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Imagery  using Wavelet-Enhanced Cost-sensitive Symmetric Fully Convolutional Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06904.pdf)
> The knowledge about the placement and appearance of lane markings is a prerequisite for the creation of maps with high precision, necessary for autonomous driving, infrastructure monitoring, lane-wise traffic management, and urban planning. Lane markings are one of the important components of such maps. Lane markings convey the rules of roads to drivers. While these rules are learned by humans, an autonomous driving vehicle should be taught to learn them to localize itself. Therefore, accurate and reliable lane marking semantic segmentation in the imagery of roads and highways is needed to achieve such goals. We use airborne imagery which can capture a large area in a short period of time by introducing an aerial lane marking dataset. In this work, we propose a Symmetric Fully Convolutional Neural Network enhanced by Wavelet Transform in order to automatically carry out lane marking segmentation in aerial imagery. Due to a heavily unbalanced problem in terms of number of lane marking pixels compared with background pixels, we use a customized loss function as well as a new type of data augmentation step. We achieve a very high accuracy in pixel-wise localization of lane markings without using 3rd-party information. In this work, we introduce the first high-quality dataset used within our experiments which contains a broad range of situations and classes of lane markings representative of current transportation systems. This dataset will be publicly available and hence, it can be used as the benchmark dataset for future algorithms within this domain. 
### 330.Unsupervised Semantic Deep Hashing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06911.pdf)
> In recent years, deep hashing methods have been proved to be efficient since it employs convolutional neural network to learn features and hashing codes simultaneously. However, these methods are mostly supervised. In real-world application, it is a time-consuming and overloaded task for annotating a large number of images. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep hashing method for large-scale image retrieval. Our method, namely unsupervised semantic deep hashing (\textbf{USDH}), uses semantic information preserved in the CNN feature layer to guide the training of network. We enforce four criteria on hashing codes learning based on VGG-19 model: 1) preserving relevant information of feature space in hashing space; 2) minimizing quantization loss between binary-like codes and hashing codes; 3) improving the usage of each bit in hashing codes by using maximum information entropy, and 4) invariant to image rotation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, NUSWIDE have demonstrated that \textbf{USDH} outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods for image retrieval. We also conduct experiments on Oxford 17 datasets for fine-grained classification to verify its efficiency for other computer vision tasks. 
### 331.Inverse Visual Question Answering: A New Benchmark and VQA Diagnosis  Tool [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06936.pdf)
> In recent years, visual question answering (VQA) has become topical. The premise of VQA's significance as a benchmark in AI, is that both the image and textual question need to be well understood and mutually grounded in order to infer the correct answer. However, current VQA models perhaps `understand' less than initially hoped, and instead master the easier task of exploiting cues given away in the question and biases in the answer distribution. In this paper we propose the inverse problem of VQA (iVQA). The iVQA task is to generate a question that corresponds to a given image and answer pair. We propose a variational iVQA model that can generate diverse, grammatically correct and content correlated questions that match the given answer. Based on this model, we show that iVQA is an interesting benchmark for visuo-linguistic understanding, and a more challenging alternative to VQA because an iVQA model needs to understand the image better to be successful. As a second contribution, we show how to use iVQA in a novel reinforcement learning framework to diagnose any existing VQA model by way of exposing its belief set: the set of question-answer pairs that the VQA model would predict true for a given image. This provides a completely new window into what VQA models `believe' about images. We show that existing VQA models have more erroneous beliefs than previously thought, revealing their intrinsic weaknesses. Suggestions are then made on how to address these weaknesses going forward. 
### 332.Deja Vu: Motion Prediction in Static Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06951.pdf)
> This paper proposes motion prediction in single still images by learning it from a set of videos. The building assumption is that similar motion is characterized by similar appearance. The proposed method learns local motion patterns given a specific appearance and adds the predicted motion in a number of applications. This work (i) introduces a novel method to predict motion from appearance in a single static image, (ii) to that end, extends of the Structured Random Forest with regression derived from first principles, and (iii) shows the value of adding motion predictions in different tasks such as: weak frame-proposals containing unexpected events, action recognition, motion saliency. Illustrative results indicate that motion prediction is not only feasible, but also provides valuable information for a number of applications. 
### 333.Featureless: Bypassing feature extraction in action categorization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06962.pdf)
> This method introduces an efficient manner of learning action categories without the need of feature estimation. The approach starts from low-level values, in a similar style to the successful CNN methods. However, rather than extracting general image features, we learn to predict specific video representations from raw video data. The benefit of such an approach is that at the same computational expense it can predict 2 D video representations as well as 3 D ones, based on motion. The proposed model relies on discriminative Waldboost, which we enhance to a multiclass formulation for the purpose of learning video representations. The suitability of the proposed approach as well as its time efficiency are tested on the UCF11 action recognition dataset. 
### 334.Improving Transferability of Adversarial Examples with Input Diversity [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06978.pdf)
> Though convolutional neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various vision tasks, they are extremely vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are obtained by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to the original images. Adversarial examples can thus be used as an useful tool to evaluate and select the most robust models in safety-critical applications. However, most of the existing adversarial attacks only achieve relatively low success rates under the challenging black-box setting, where the attackers have no knowledge of the model structure and parameters. To this end, we propose to improve the transferability of adversarial examples by creating diverse input patterns. Instead of only using the original images to generate adversarial examples, our method applies random transformations to the input images at each iteration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show that the proposed attack method can generate adversarial examples that transfer much better to different networks than existing baselines. To further improve the transferability, we (1) integrate the recently proposed momentum method into the attack process; and (2) attack an ensemble of networks simultaneously. By evaluating our method against top defense submissions and official baselines from NIPS 2017 adversarial competition, this enhanced attack reaches an average success rate of 73.0%, which outperforms the top 1 attack submission in the NIPS competition by a large margin of 6.6%. We hope that our proposed attack strategy can serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of networks to adversaries and the effectiveness of different defense methods in future.

### 335.Live Target Detection with Deep Learning Neural Network and Unmanned  Aerial Vehicle on Android Mobile Device [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07015.pdf)
> This paper describes the stages faced during the development of an Android program which obtains and decodes live images from DJI Phantom 3 Professional Drone and implements certain features of the TensorFlow Android Camera Demo application. Test runs were made and outputs of the application were noted. A lake was classified as seashore, breakwater and pier with the proximities of 24.44%, 21.16% and 12.96% respectfully. The joystick of the UAV controller and laptop keyboard was classified with the proximities of 19.10% and 13.96% respectfully. The laptop monitor was classified as screen, monitor and television with the proximities of 18.77%, 14.76% and 14.00% respectfully. The computer used during the development of this study was classified as notebook and laptop with the proximities of 20.04% and 11.68% respectfully. A tractor parked at a parking lot was classified with the proximity of 12.88%. A group of cars in the same parking lot were classified as sports car, racer and convertible with the proximities of 31.75%, 18.64% and 13.45% respectfully at an inference time of 851ms. 
### 336.Factorised spatial representation learning: application in  semi-supervised myocardial segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07031.pdf)
> The success and generalisation of deep learning algorithms heavily depend on learning good feature representations. In medical imaging this entails representing anatomical information, as well as properties related to the specific imaging setting. Anatomical information is required to perform further analysis, whereas imaging information is key to disentangle scanner variability and potential artefacts. The ability to factorise these would allow for training algorithms only on the relevant information according to the task. To date, such factorisation has not been attempted. In this paper, we propose a methodology of latent space factorisation relying on the cycle-consistency principle. As an example application, we consider cardiac MR segmentation, where we separate information related to the myocardium from other features related to imaging and surrounding substructures. We demonstrate the proposed method's utility in a semi-supervised setting: we use very few labelled images together with many unlabelled images to train a myocardium segmentation neural network. Compared to fully supervised networks we achieve comparable performance using a fraction of labelled images in experiments on ACDC and a private data set. 
### 337.Learning Region Features for Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07066.pdf)
> While most steps in the modern object detection methods are learnable, the region feature extraction step remains largely hand-crafted, featured by RoI pooling methods. This work proposes a general viewpoint that unifies existing region feature extraction methods and a novel method that is end-to-end learnable. The proposed method removes most heuristic choices and outperforms its RoI pooling counterparts. It moves further towards fully learnable object detection. 
### 338.VGAN-Based Image Representation Learning for Privacy-Preserving Facial  Expression Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07100.pdf)
> Reliable facial expression recognition plays a critical role in human-machine interactions. However, most of the facial expression analysis methodologies proposed to date pay little or no attention to the protection of a user's privacy. In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Representation-Learning Variational Generative Adversarial Network (PPRL-VGAN) to learn an image representation that is explicitly disentangled from the identity information. At the same time, this representation is discriminative from the standpoint of facial expression recognition and generative as it allows expression-equivalent face image synthesis. We evaluate the proposed model on two public datasets under various threat scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach strikes a balance between the preservation of privacy and data utility. We further demonstrate that our model can be effectively applied to other tasks such as expression morphing and image completion. 
### 339.Zero-Shot Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07113.pdf)
> As we move towards large-scale object detection, it is unrealistic to expect annotated training data for all object classes at sufficient scale, and so methods capable of unseen object detection are required. We propose a novel zero-shot method based on training an end-to-end model that fuses semantic attribute prediction with visual features to propose object bounding boxes for seen and unseen classes. While we utilize semantic features during training, our method is agnostic to semantic information for unseen classes at test-time. Our method retains the efficiency and effectiveness of YOLO for objects seen during training, while improving its performance for novel and unseen objects. The ability of state-of-art detection methods to learn discriminative object features to reject background proposals also limits their performance for unseen objects. <br />We posit that, to detect unseen objects, we must incorporate semantic information into the visual domain so that the learned visual features reflect this information and leads to improved recall rates for unseen objects. We test our method on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO dataset and observed significant improvements on the average precision of unseen classes. 
### 340.Local Binary Pattern Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07125.pdf)
> Memory and computation efficient deep learning architec- tures are crucial to continued proliferation of machine learning capabili- ties to new platforms and systems. Binarization of operations in convo- lutional neural networks has shown promising results in reducing model size and computing efficiency. In this paper, we tackle the problem us- ing a strategy different from the existing literature by proposing local binary pattern networks or LBPNet, that is able to learn and perform binary operations in an end-to-end fashion. LBPNet1 uses local binary comparisons and random projection in place of conventional convolu- tion (or approximation of convolution) operations. These operations can be implemented efficiently on different platforms including direct hard- ware implementation. We applied LBPNet and its variants on standard benchmarks. The results are promising across benchmarks while provid- ing an important means to improve memory and speed efficiency that is particularly suited for small footprint devices and hardware accelerators. 
### 341.Visual Psychophysics for Making Face Recognition Algorithms More  Explainable [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07140.pdf)
> Scientific fields that are interested in faces have developed their own sets of concepts and procedures for understanding how a target model system (be it a person or algorithm) perceives a face under varying conditions. In computer vision, this has largely been in the form of dataset evaluation for recognition tasks where summary statistics are used to measure progress. While aggregate performance has continued to improve, understanding individual causes of failure has been difficult, as it is not always clear why a particular face fails to be recognized, or why an impostor is recognized by an algorithm. Importantly, other fields studying vision have addressed this via the use of visual psychophysics: the controlled manipulation of stimuli and careful study of the responses they evoke in a model system. In this paper, we suggest that visual psychophysics is a viable methodology for making face recognition algorithms more explainable. A comprehensive set of procedures is developed for assessing face recognition algorithm behavior, which is then deployed over state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and more basic, yet still widely used, shallow and handcrafted feature-based approaches. 
### 342.Attention-based Temporal Weighted Convolutional Neural Network for  Action Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07179.pdf)
> Research in human action recognition has accelerated significantly since the introduction of powerful machine learning tools such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, effective and efficient methods for incorporation of temporal information into CNNs are still being actively explored in the recent literature. Motivated by the popular recurrent attention models in the research area of natural language processing, we propose the Attention-based Temporal Weighted CNN (ATW), which embeds a visual attention model into a temporal weighted multi-stream CNN. This attention model is simply implemented as temporal weighting yet it effectively boosts the recognition performance of video representations. Besides, each stream in the proposed ATW framework is capable of end-to-end training, with both network parameters and temporal weights optimized by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation. Our experiments show that the proposed attention mechanism contributes substantially to the performance gains with the more discriminative snippets by focusing on more relevant video segments. 
### 343.Unveiling the invisible - mathematical methods for restoring and  interpreting illuminated manuscripts [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07187.pdf)
> The last fifty years have seen an impressive development of mathematical methods for the analysis and processing of digital images, mostly in the context of photography, biomedical imaging and various forms of engineering. The arts have been mostly overlooked in this process, apart from a few exceptional works in the last ten years. With the rapid emergence of digitisation in the arts, however, the arts domain is becoming increasingly receptive to digital image processing methods and the importance of paying attention to this therefore increases. In this paper we discuss a range of mathematical methods for digital image restoration and digital visualisation for illuminated manuscripts. The latter provide an interesting opportunity for digital manipulation because they traditionally remain physically untouched. At the same time they also serve as an example for the possibilities mathematics and digital restoration offer as a generic and objective toolkit for the arts. 
### 344.A Minimalist Approach to Type-Agnostic Detection of Quadrics in Point  Clouds [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07191.pdf)
> This paper proposes a segmentation-free, automatic and efficient procedure to detect general geometric quadric forms in point clouds, where clutter and occlusions are inevitable. Our everyday world is dominated by man-made objects which are designed using 3D primitives (such as planes, cones, spheres, cylinders, etc.). These objects are also omnipresent in industrial environments. This gives rise to the possibility of abstracting 3D scenes through primitives, thereby positions these geometric forms as an integral part of perception and high level 3D scene understanding. <br />As opposed to state-of-the-art, where a tailored algorithm treats each primitive type separately, we propose to encapsulate all types in a single robust detection procedure. At the center of our approach lies a closed form 3D quadric fit, operating in both primal &amp; dual spaces and requiring as low as 4 oriented-points. Around this fit, we design a novel, local null-space voting strategy to reduce the 4-point case to 3. Voting is coupled with the famous RANSAC and makes our algorithm orders of magnitude faster than its conventional counterparts. This is the first method capable of performing a generic cross-type multi-object primitive detection in difficult scenes. Results on synthetic and real datasets support the validity of our method. 
### 345.Diagnostic Classification Of Lung Nodules Using 3D Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07192.pdf)
> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Early diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in Computed Tomography (CT) chest scans provides an opportunity for designing effective treatment and making financial and care plans. In this paper, we consider the problem of diagnostic classification between benign and malignant lung nodules in CT images, which aims to learn a direct mapping from 3D images to class labels. To achieve this goal, four two-pathway Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are proposed, including a basic 3D CNN, a novel multi-output network, a 3D DenseNet, and an augmented 3D DenseNet with multi-outputs. These four networks are evaluated on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset and outperform most existing methods. In particular, the 3D multi-output DenseNet (MoDenseNet) achieves the state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the task of end-to-end lung nodule diagnosis. In addition, the networks pretrained on the LIDC-IDRI dataset can be further extended to handle smaller datasets using transfer learning. This is demonstrated on our dataset with encouraging prediction accuracy in lung nodule classification. 
### 346.DYAN: A Dynamical Atoms Network for Video Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07201.pdf)
> The ability to anticipate the future is essential when making real time critical decisions, provides valuable information to understand dynamic natural scenes, and can help unsupervised video representation learning. State-of-art video prediction is based on LSTM recursive networks and/or generative adversarial network learning. These are complex architectures that need to learn large numbers of parameters, are potentially hard to train, slow to run, and may produce blurry predictions. In this paper, we introduce DYAN, a novel network with very few parameters and easy to train, which produces accurate, high quality frame predictions, significantly faster than previous approaches. DYAN owes its good qualities to its encoder and decoder, which are designed following concepts from systems identification theory and exploit the dynamics-based invariants of the data. Extensive experiments using several standard video datasets show that DYAN is superior generating frames and that it generalizes well across domains. 
### 347.Real-time Burst Photo Selection Using a Light-Head Adversarial Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07212.pdf)
> We present an automatic moment capture system that runs in real-time on mobile cameras. The system is designed to run in the viewfinder mode and capture a burst sequence of frames before and after the shutter is pressed. For each frame, the system predicts in real-time a "goodness" score, based on which the best moment in the burst can be selected immediately after the shutter is released, without any user interference. To solve the problem, we develop a highly efficient deep neural network ranking model, which implicitly learns a "latent relative attribute" space to capture subtle visual differences within a sequence of burst images. Then the overall goodness is computed as a linear aggregation of the goodnesses of all the latent attributes. The latent relative attributes and the aggregation function can be seamlessly integrated in one fully convolutional network and trained in an end-to-end fashion. To obtain a compact model which can run on mobile devices in real-time, we have explored and evaluated a wide range of network design choices, taking into account the constraints of model size, computational cost, and accuracy. Extensive studies show that the best frame predicted by our model hit users' top-1 (out of 11 on average) choice for $64.1\%$ cases and top-3 choices for $86.2\%$ cases. Moreover, the model(only 0.47M Bytes) can run in real time on mobile devices, e.g. only 13ms on iPhone 7 for one frame prediction. 
### 348.A Temporally-Aware Interpolation Network for Video Frame Inpainting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07218.pdf)
> We propose the first deep learning solution to video frame inpainting, a challenging instance of the general video inpainting problem with applications in video editing, manipulation, and forensics. Our task is less ambiguous than frame interpolation and video prediction because we have access to both the temporal context and a partial glimpse of the future, allowing us to better evaluate the quality of a model's predictions objectively. We devise a pipeline composed of two modules: a bidirectional video prediction module, and a temporally-aware frame interpolation module. The prediction module makes two intermediate predictions of the missing frames, one conditioned on the preceding frames and the other conditioned on the following frames, using a shared convolutional LSTM-based encoder-decoder. The interpolation module blends the intermediate predictions to form the final result. Specifically, it utilizes time information and hidden activations from the video prediction module to resolve disagreements between the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and qualitatively satisfying results than a state-of-the-art video prediction method and many strong frame inpainting baselines. 
### 349.Learning the Hierarchical Parts of Objects by Deep Non-Smooth  Nonnegative Matrix Factorization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07226.pdf)
> Nonsmooth Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (nsNMF) is capable of producing more localized, less overlapped feature representations than other variants of NMF while keeping satisfactory fit to data. However, nsNMF as well as other existing NMF methods is incompetent to learn hierarchical features of complex data due to its shallow structure. To fill this gap, we propose a deep nsNMF method coined by the fact that it possesses a deeper architecture compared with standard nsNMF. The deep nsNMF not only gives parts-based features due to the nonnegativity constraints, but also creates higher-level, more abstract features by combing lower-level ones. The in-depth description of how deep architecture can help to efficiently discover abstract features in dnsNMF is presented. And we also show that the deep nsNMF has close relationship with the deep autoencoder, suggesting that the proposed model inherits the major advantages from both deep learning and NMF. Extensive experiments demonstrate the standout performance of the proposed method in clustering analysis. 
### 350.Hierarchical Metric Learning and Matching for 2D and 3D Geometric  Correspondences [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07231.pdf)
> Interest point descriptors have fueled progress on almost every problem in computer vision. Recent advances in deep neural networks have enabled task-specific learned descriptors that outperform hand-crafted descriptors on many problems. We demonstrate that commonly used metric learning approaches do not optimally leverage the feature hierarchies learned in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), especially when applied to the task of geometric feature matching. While a metric loss applied to the deepest layer of a CNN, is often expected to yield ideal features irrespective of the task, in fact the growing receptive field as well as striding effects cause shallower features to be better at high precision matching tasks. We leverage this insight together with explicit supervision at multiple levels of the feature hierarchy for better regularization, to learn more effective descriptors in the context of geometric matching tasks. Further, we propose to use activation maps at different layers of a CNN, as an effective and principled replacement for the multi-resolution image pyramids often used for matching tasks. We propose concrete CNN architectures employing these ideas, and evaluate them on multiple datasets for 2D and 3D geometric matching as well as optical flow, demonstrating state-of-the-art results and generalization across datasets. 
### 351.SlideNet: Fast and Accurate Slide Quality Assessment Based on Deep  Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07240.pdf)
> This work tackles the automatic fine-grained slide quality assessment problem for digitized direct smears test using the Gram staining protocol. Automatic quality assessment can provide useful information for the pathologists and the whole digital pathology workflow. For instance, if the system found a slide to have a low staining quality, it could send a request to the automatic slide preparation system to remake the slide. If the system detects severe damage in the slides, it could notify the experts that manual microscope reading may be required. In order to address the quality assessment problem, we propose a deep neural network based framework to automatically assess the slide quality in a semantic way. Specifically, the first step of our framework is to perform dense fine-grained region classification on the whole slide and calculate the region distribution histogram. Next, our framework will generate assessments of the slide quality from various perspectives: staining quality, information density, damage level and which regions are more valuable for subsequent high-magnification analysis. To make the information more accessible, we present our results in the form of a heat map and text summaries. Additionally, in order to stimulate research in this direction, we propose a novel dataset for slide quality assessment. Experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms recent related works. 
### 352.3D Point Cloud Denoising using Graph Laplacian Regularization of a Low  Dimensional Manifold Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07252.pdf)
> 3D point cloud - a new signal representation of volumetric objects - is a discrete collection of triples marking exterior object surface locations in 3D space. Conventional imperfect acquisition processes of 3D point cloud - e.g., stereo-matching from multiple viewpoint images or depth data acquired directly from active light sensors - imply non-negligible noise in the data. In this paper, we adopt a previously proposed low-dimensional manifold model for the surface patches in the point cloud and seek self-similar patches to denoise them simultaneously using the patch manifold prior. Due to discrete observations of the patches on the manifold, we approximate the manifold dimension computation defined in the continuous domain with a patch-based graph Laplacian regularizer and propose a new discrete patch distance measure to quantify the similarity between two same-sized surface patches for graph construction that is robust to noise. We show that our graph Laplacian regularizer has a natural graph spectral interpretation, and has desirable numerical stability properties via eigenanalysis. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed denoising scheme can outperform state-of-the-art methods in objective metrics and can better preserve visually salient structural features like edges. 
### 353.Transferring Rich Deep Features for Facial Beauty Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07253.pdf)
> Feature extraction plays a significant part in computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a method which transfers rich deep features from a pretrained model on face verification task and feeds the features into Bayesian ridge regression algorithm for facial beauty prediction. We leverage the deep neural networks that extracts more abstract features from stacked layers. Through simple but effective feature fusion strategy, our method achieves improved or comparable performance on SCUT-FBP dataset and ECCV HotOrNot dataset. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and clarify the inner interpretability of facial beauty perception. 
### 354.Learning Dynamic Memory Networks for Object Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07268.pdf)
> Template-matching methods for visual tracking have gained popularity recently due to their comparable performance and fast speed. However, they lack effective ways to adapt to changes in the target object's appearance, making their tracking accuracy still far from state-of-the-art. In this paper, we propose a dynamic memory network to adapt the template to the target's appearance variations during tracking. An LSTM is used as a memory controller, where the input is the search feature map and the outputs are the control signals for the reading and writing process of the memory block. As the location of the target is at first unknown in the search feature map, an attention mechanism is applied to concentrate the LSTM input on the potential target. To prevent aggressive model adaptivity, we apply gated residual template learning to control the amount of retrieved memory that is used to combine with the initial template. Unlike tracking-by-detection methods where the object's information is maintained by the weight parameters of neural networks, which requires expensive online fine-tuning to be adaptable, our tracker runs completely feed-forward and adapts to the target's appearance changes by updating the external memory. Moreover, unlike other tracking methods where the model capacity is fixed after offline training --- the capacity of our tracker can be easily enlarged as the memory requirements of a task increase, which is favorable for memorizing long-term object information. Extensive experiments on OTB and VOT demonstrates that our tracker MemTrack performs favorably against state-of-the-art tracking methods while retaining real-time speed of 50 fps. 
### 355.Text Detection and Recognition in images: A survey [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07278.pdf)
> Text Detection and recognition is a one of the important aspect of image processing. This paper analyzes and compares the methods to handle this task. It summarizes the fundamental problems and enumerates factors that need consideration when addressing these problems. Existing techniques are categorized as either stepwise or integrated and sub-problems are highlighted including digit localization, verification, segmentation and recognition. Special issues associated with the enhancement of degraded text and the processing of video text and multi-oriented text are also addressed. The categories and sub-categories of text are illustrated, benchmark datasets are enumerated, and the performance of the most representative approaches is compared. This review also provides a fundamental comparison and analysis of the remaining problems in the field. 
### 356.Face Recognition Techniques: A Survey [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07288.pdf)
> Nowadays research has expanded to extracting auxiliary information from various biometric techniques like fingerprints, face, iris, palm and voice . This information contains some major features like gender, age, beard, mustache, scars, height, hair, skin color, glasses, weight, facial marks and tattoos. All this information contributes strongly to identification of human. The major challenges that come across face recognition are to find age &amp; gender of the person. This paper contributes a survey of various face recognition techniques for finding the age and gender. The existing techniques are discussed based on their performances. This paper also provides future directions for further research. 
### 357.Flex-Convolution (Deep Learning Beyond Grid-Worlds) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07289.pdf)
> Traditional convolution layers are specifically designed to exploit the natural data representation of images -- a fixed and regular grid. However, unstructured data like 3D point clouds containing irregular neighborhoods constantly breaks the grid-based data assumption. Therefore applying best-practices and design choices from 2D-image learning methods towards processing point clouds are not readily possible. In this work, we introduce a natural generalization flex-convolution of the conventional convolution layer along with an efficient GPU implementation. We demonstrate competitive performance on rather small benchmark sets using fewer parameters and lower memory consumption and obtain significant improvements on a million-scale real-world dataset. Ours is the first which allows to efficiently process 7 million points concurrently. 
### 358.Unsupervised Cross-dataset Person Re-identification by Transfer Learning  of Spatial-Temporal Patterns [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07293.pdf)
> Most of the proposed person re-identification algorithms conduct supervised training and testing on single labeled datasets with small size, so directly deploying these trained models to a large-scale real-world camera network may lead to poor performance due to underfitting. It is challenging to incrementally optimize the models by using the abundant unlabeled data collected from the target domain. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised incremental learning algorithm, TFusion, which is aided by the transfer learning of the pedestrians' spatio-temporal patterns in the target domain. Specifically, the algorithm firstly transfers the visual classifier trained from small labeled source dataset to the unlabeled target dataset so as to learn the pedestrians' spatial-temporal patterns. Secondly, a Bayesian fusion model is proposed to combine the learned spatio-temporal patterns with visual features to achieve a significantly improved classifier. Finally, we propose a learning-to-rank based mutual promotion procedure to incrementally optimize the classifiers based on the unlabeled data in the target domain. Comprehensive experiments based on multiple real surveillance datasets are conducted, and the results show that our algorithm gains significant improvement compared with the state-of-art cross-dataset unsupervised person re-identification algorithms. 
### 359.Segmentation of histological images and fibrosis identification with a  convolutional neural network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07301.pdf)
> Segmentation of histological images is one of the most crucial tasks for many biomedical analyses including quantification of certain tissue type. However, challenges are posed by high variability and complexity of structural features in such images, in addition to imaging artifacts. Further, the conventional approach of manual thresholding is labor-intensive, and highly sensitive to inter- and intra-image intensity variations. An accurate and robust automated segmentation method is of high interest. We propose and evaluate an elegant convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for segmentation of histological images, particularly those with Masson's trichrome stain. The network comprises of 11 successive convolutional - rectified linear unit - batch normalization layers, and outperformed state-of-the-art CNNs on a dataset of cardiac histological images (labeling fibrosis, myocytes, and background) with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.947. With 100 times fewer (only 300 thousand) trainable parameters, our CNN is less susceptible to overfitting, and is efficient. Additionally, it retains image resolution from input to output, captures fine-grained details, and can be trained end-to-end smoothly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep CNN tailored for the problem of concern, and may be extended to solve similar segmentation tasks to facilitate investigations into pathology and clinical treatment. 
### 360.Progressive Structure from Motion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07349.pdf)
> Structure from Motion or the sparse 3D reconstruction out of individual photos is a long studied topic in computer vision. Yet none of the existing reconstruction pipelines fully addresses a progressive scenario where images are only getting available during the reconstruction process and intermediate results are delivered to the user. Incremental pipelines are capable of growing a 3D model but often get stuck in local minima due to wrong (binding) decisions taken based on incomplete information. Global pipelines on the other hand need the access to the complete viewgraph and are not capable of delivering intermediate results. In this paper we propose a new reconstruction pipeline working in a progressive manner rather than in a batch processing scheme. The pipeline is able to recover from failed reconstructions in early stages, avoids to take binding decisions, delivers a progressive output and yet maintains the capabilities of existing pipelines. We demonstrate and evaluate our method on diverse challenging public and dedicated datasets including those with highly symmetric structures and compare to the state of the art. 
### 361.Discrete Potts Model for Generating Superpixels on Noisy Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07351.pdf)
> Many computer vision applications, such as object recognition and segmentation, increasingly build on superpixels. However, there have been so far few superpixel algorithms that systematically deal with noisy images. We propose to first decompose the image into equal-sized rectangular patches, which also sets the maximum superpixel size. Within each patch, a Potts model for simultaneous segmentation and denoising is applied, that guarantees connected and non-overlapping superpixels and also produces a denoised image. The corresponding optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP), and solved by a commercial solver. Extensive experiments on the BSDS500 dataset images with noises are compared with other state-of-the-art superpixel methods. Our method achieves the best result in terms of a combined score (OP) composed of the under-segmentation error, boundary recall and compactness. 
### 362.Adaptive Co-weighting Deep Convolutional Features For Object Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07360.pdf)
> Aggregating deep convolutional features into a global image vector has attracted sustained attention in image retrieval. In this paper, we propose an efficient unsupervised aggregation method that uses an adaptive Gaussian filter and an elementvalue sensitive vector to co-weight deep features. Specifically, the Gaussian filter assigns large weights to features of region-of-interests (RoI) by adaptively determining the RoI's center, while the element-value sensitive channel vector suppresses burstiness phenomenon by assigning small weights to feature maps with large sum values of all locations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets validate the proposed two weighting schemes both effectively improve the discrimination power of image vectors. Furthermore, with the same experimental setting, our method outperforms other very recent aggregation approaches by a considerable margin. 
### 363.Are you eligible? Predicting adulthood from face images via class  specific mean autoencoder [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07385.pdf)
> Predicting if a person is an adult or a minor has several applications such as inspecting underage driving, preventing purchase of alcohol and tobacco by minors, and granting restricted access. The challenging nature of this problem arises due to the complex and unique physiological changes that are observed with age progression. This paper presents a novel deep learning based formulation, termed as Class Specific Mean Autoencoder, to learn the intra-class similarity and extract class-specific features. We propose that the feature of a particular class if brought similar/closer to the mean feature of that class can help in learning class-specific representations. The proposed formulation is applied for the task of adulthood classification which predicts whether the given face image is of an adult or not. Experiments are performed on two large databases and the results show that the proposed algorithm yields higher classification accuracy compared to existing algorithms and a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf system. 
### 364.Residual Codean Autoencoder for Facial Attribute Analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07386.pdf)
> Facial attributes can provide rich ancillary information which can be utilized for different applications such as targeted marketing, human computer interaction, and law enforcement. This research focuses on facial attribute prediction using a novel deep learning formulation, termed as R-Codean autoencoder. The paper first presents Cosine similarity based loss function in an autoencoder which is then incorporated into the Euclidean distance based autoencoder to formulate R-Codean. The proposed loss function thus aims to incorporate both magnitude and direction of image vectors during feature learning. Further, inspired by the utility of shortcut connections in deep models to facilitate learning of optimal parameters, without incurring the problem of vanishing gradient, the proposed formulation is extended to incorporate shortcut connections in the architecture. The proposed R-Codean autoencoder is utilized in facial attribute prediction framework which incorporates patch-based weighting mechanism for assigning higher weights to relevant patches for each attribute. The experimental results on publicly available CelebA and LFWA datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in addressing this challenging problem. 
### 365.Patch-Based Image Inpainting with Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07422.pdf)
> Area of image inpainting over relatively large missing regions recently advanced substantially through adaptation of dedicated deep neural networks. However, current network solutions still introduce undesired artifacts and noise to the repaired regions. We present an image inpainting method that is based on the celebrated generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. The proposed PGGAN method includes a discriminator network that combines a global GAN (G-GAN) architecture with a patchGAN approach. PGGAN first shares network layers between G-GAN and patchGAN, then splits paths to produce two adversarial losses that feed the generator network in order to capture both local continuity of image texture and pervasive global features in images. The proposed framework is evaluated extensively, and the results including comparison to recent state-of-the-art demonstrate that it achieves considerable improvements on both visual and quantitative evaluations. 
### 366.DUGMA: Dynamic Uncertainty-Based Gaussian Mixture Alignment [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07426.pdf)
> Registering accurately point clouds from a cheap low-resolution sensor is a challenging task. Existing rigid registration methods failed to use the physical 3D uncertainty distribution of each point from a real sensor in the dynamic alignment process mainly because the uncertainty model for a point is static and invariant and it is hard to describe the change of these physical uncertainty models in the registration process. Additionally, the existing Gaussian mixture alignment architecture cannot be efficiently implement these dynamic changes. <br />This paper proposes a simple architecture combining error estimation from sample covariances and dual dynamic global probability alignment using the convolution of uncertainty-based Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) from point clouds. Firstly, we propose an efficient way to describe the change of each 3D uncertainty model, which represents the structure of the point cloud much better. Unlike the invariant GMM (representing a fixed point cloud) in traditional Gaussian mixture alignment, we use two uncertainty-based GMMs that change and interact with each other in each iteration. In order to have a wider basin of convergence than other local algorithms, we design a more robust energy function by convolving efficiently the two GMMs over the whole 3D space. <br />Tens of thousands of trials have been conducted on hundreds of models from multiple datasets to demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance compared with the current state-of-the-art methods. The new dataset and code is available from <a href="https://github.com/Canpu999">this https URL</a> 
### 367.Ocean Eddy Identification and Tracking using Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07436.pdf)
> Global climate change plays an essential role in our daily life. Mesoscale ocean eddies have a significant impact on global warming, since they affect the ocean dynamics, the energy as well as the mass transports of ocean circulation. From satellite altimetry we can derive high-resolution, global maps containing ocean signals with dominating coherent eddy structures. The aim of this study is the development and evaluation of a deep-learning based approach for the analysis of eddies. In detail, we develop an eddy identification and tracking framework with two different approaches that are mainly based on feature learning with convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, state-of-the-art image processing tools and object tracking methods are used to support the eddy tracking. In contrast to previous methods, our framework is able to learn a representation of the data in which eddies can be detected and tracked in more objective and robust way. We show the detection and tracking results on sea level anomalies (SLA) data from the area of Australia and the East Australia current, and compare our two eddy detection and tracking approaches to identify the most robust and objective method. 
### 368.LDOP: Local Directional Order Pattern for Robust Face Retrieval [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07441.pdf)
> The local descriptors have gained wide range of attention due to their enhanced discriminative abilities. It has been proved that the consideration of multi-scale local neighborhood improves the performance of the descriptor, though at the cost of increased dimension. This paper proposes a novel method to construct a local descriptor using multi-scale neighborhood by finding the local directional order among the intensity values at different scales in a particular direction. Local directional order is the multi-radius relationship factor (i.e.) in a particular direction. The proposed local directional order pattern (LDOP) for a particular pixel is computed by finding the relationship between the center pixel and local directional order indexes. It is required to transform the center value in the range of neighboring orders. Finally, the histogram of LDOP is computed over whole image to construct the descriptor. In contrast to the state-of-the-art descriptors, the dimension of the proposed descriptor does not depend upon the number of neighbors involved to compute the order; it only depends upon the number of directions. The introduced descriptor is evaluated over the image retrieval framework and compared with the state-of-the-art descriptors over challenging face databases such as PaSC, LFW, PubFig, FERET, AR, AT&amp;T, and ExtendedYale. The experimental results confirm the superiority and robustness of the LDOP descriptor. 
### 369.Semi-Blind Spatially-Variant Deconvolution in Optical Microscopy with  Local Point Spread Function Estimation By Use Of Convolutional Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07452.pdf)
> We present a semi-blind, spatially-variant deconvolution technique aimed at optical microscopy that combines a local estimation step of the point spread function (PSF) and deconvolution using a spatially variant, regularized Richardson-Lucy algorithm. To find the local PSF map in a computationally tractable way, we train a convolutional neural network to perform regression of an optical parametric model on synthetically blurred image patches. We deconvolved both synthetic and experimentally-acquired data, and achieved an improvement of image SNR of 1.00 dB on average, compared to other deconvolution algorithms. 
### 370.Speech-Driven Facial Reenactment Using Conditional Generative  Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07461.pdf)
> We present a novel approach to generating photo-realistic images of a face with accurate lip sync, given an audio input. By using a recurrent neural network, we achieved mouth landmarks based on audio features. We exploited the power of conditional generative adversarial networks to produce highly-realistic face conditioned on a set of landmarks. These two networks together are capable of producing a sequence of natural faces in sync with an input audio track. 
### 371.VQA-E: Explaining, Elaborating, and Enhancing Your Answers for Visual  Questions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07464.pdf)
> Most existing works in visual question answering (VQA) are dedicated to improving the accuracy of predicted answers, while disregarding the explanations. We argue that the explanation for an answer is of the same or even more importance compared with the answer itself, since it makes the question and answering process more understandable and traceable. To this end, we propose a new task of VQA-E (VQA with Explanation), where the computational models are required to generate an explanation with the predicted answer. We first construct a new dataset, and then frame the VQA-E problem in a multi-task learning architecture. Our VQA-E dataset is automatically derived from the VQA v2 dataset by intelligently exploiting the available captions. We have conducted a user study to validate the quality of explanations synthesized by our method. We quantitatively show that the additional supervision from explanations can not only produce insightful textual sentences to justify the answers, but also improve the performance of answer prediction. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin on the VQA v2 dataset. 
### 372.MAGSAC: marginalizing sample consensus [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07469.pdf)
> A method called sigma-consensus is proposed to eliminate the need for a user-defined inlier-outlier threshold in RANSAC. Instead of estimating sigma, it is marginalized over a range of noise scales using a Bayesian estimator, i.e. the optimized model is obtained as the weighted average using the posterior probabilities as weights. Applying sigma-consensus, two methods are proposed: (i) a post-processing step which always improved the model quality on a wide range of vision problems without noticeable deterioration in processing time, i.e. at most 1-2 milliseconds; and (ii) a locally optimized RANSAC, called LO-MAGSAC, which includes sigma-consensus to the local optimization of LO-RANSAC. The method is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of geometric accuracy on publicly available real world datasets for epipolar geometry (F and E), homography and affine transformation estimation. 
### 373.An Improved Evaluation Framework for Generative Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07474.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose an improved quantitative evaluation framework for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on generating domain-specific images, where we improve conventional evaluation methods on two levels: the feature representation and the evaluation metric. Unlike most existing evaluation frameworks which transfer the representation of ImageNet inception model to map images onto the feature space, our framework uses a specialized encoder to acquire fine-grained domain-specific representation. Moreover, for datasets with multiple classes, we propose Class-Aware Frechet Distance (CAFD), which employs a Gaussian mixture model on the feature space to better fit the multi-manifold feature distribution. Experiments and analysis on both the feature level and the image level were conducted to demonstrate improvements of our proposed framework over the recently proposed state-of-the-art FID method. To our best knowledge, we are the first to provide counter examples where FID gives inconsistent results with human judgments. It is shown in the experiments that our framework is able to overcome the shortness of FID and improves robustness. Code will be made available. 
### 374.Actor and Action Video Segmentation from a Sentence [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07485.pdf)
> This paper strives for pixel-level segmentation of actors and their actions in video content. Different from existing works, which all learn to segment from a fixed vocabulary of actor and action pairs, we infer the segmentation from a natural language input sentence. This allows to distinguish between fine-grained actors in the same super-category, identify actor and action instances, and segment pairs that are outside of the actor and action vocabulary. We propose a fully-convolutional model for pixel-level actor and action segmentation using an encoder-decoder architecture optimized for video. To show the potential of actor and action video segmentation from a sentence, we extend two popular actor and action datasets with more than 7,500 natural language descriptions. Experiments demonstrate the quality of the sentence-guided segmentations, the generalization ability of our model, and its advantage for traditional actor and action segmentation compared to the state-of-the-art. 
### 375.FastDeRain: A Novel Video Rain Streak Removal Method Using Directional  Gradient Priors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07487.pdf)
> Rain streak removal is an important issue in outdoor vision systems and has recently been investigated extensively. In this paper, we propose a novel video rain streak removal approach FastDeRain, which fully considers the discriminative characteristics of rain streaks and the clean video in the gradient domain. Specifically, on the one hand, rain streaks are sparse and smooth along the direction of the raindrops, whereas on the other hand, clean videos exhibit piecewise smoothness along the rain-perpendicular direction and continuity along the temporal direction. Theses smoothness and continuity results in the sparse distribution in the different directional gradient domain, respectively. Thus, we minimize 1) the $\ell_1$ norm to enhance the sparsity of the underlying rain streaks, 2) two $\ell_1$ norm of unidirectional Total Variation (TV) regularizers to guarantee the anisotropic spatial smoothness, and 3) an $\ell_1$ norm of the time-directional difference operator to characterize the temporal continuity. A split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm (SALSA) based algorithm is designed to solve the proposed minimization model. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. According to comprehensive quantitative performance measures, our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods especially on account of the running time.

### 376.Fusion of stereo and still monocular depth estimates in a  self-supervised learning context [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07512.pdf)
> We study how autonomous robots can learn by themselves to improve their depth estimation capability. In particular, we investigate a self-supervised learning setup in which stereo vision depth estimates serve as targets for a convolutional neural network (CNN) that transforms a single still image to a dense depth map. After training, the stereo and mono estimates are fused with a novel fusion method that preserves high confidence stereo estimates, while leveraging the CNN estimates in the low-confidence regions. The main contribution of the article is that it is shown that the fused estimates lead to a higher performance than the stereo vision estimates alone. Experiments are performed on the KITTI dataset, and on board of a Parrot SLAMDunk, showing that even rather limited CNNs can help provide stereo vision equipped robots with more reliable depth maps for autonomous navigation. 
### 377.C3PO: Database and Benchmark for Early-stage Malicious Activity  Detection in 3D Printing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07544.pdf)
> Increasing malicious users have sought practices to leverage 3D printing technology to produce unlawful tools in criminal activities. Current regulations are inadequate to deal with the rapid growth of 3D printers. It is of vital importance to enable 3D printers to identify the objects to be printed, so that the manufacturing procedure of an illegal weapon can be terminated at the early stage. Deep learning yields significant rises in performance in the object recognition tasks. However, the lack of large-scale databases in 3D printing domain stalls the advancement of automatic illegal weapon recognition. <br />This paper presents a new 3D printing image database, namely C3PO, which compromises two subsets for the different system working scenarios. We extract images from the numerical control programming code files of 22 3D models, and then categorize the images into 10 distinct labels. The first set consists of 62,200 images which represent the object projections on the three planes in a Cartesian coordinate system. And the second sets consists of sequences of total 671,677 images to simulate the cameras' captures of the printed objects. Importantly, we demonstrate that the weapons can be recognized in either scenario using deep learning based approaches using our proposed database. % We also use the trained deep models to build a prototype of object-aware 3D printer. The quantitative results are promising, and the future exploration of the database and the crime prevention in 3D printing are demanding tasks. 
### 378.Learning Category-Specific Mesh Reconstruction from Image Collections [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07549.pdf)
> We present a learning framework for recovering the 3D shape, camera, and texture of an object from a single image. The shape is represented as a deformable 3D mesh model of an object category where a shape is parameterized by a learned mean shape and per-instance predicted deformation. Our approach allows leveraging an annotated image collection for training, where the deformable model and the 3D prediction mechanism are learned without relying on ground-truth 3D or multi-view supervision. Our representation enables us to go beyond existing 3D prediction approaches by incorporating texture inference as prediction of an image in a canonical appearance space. Additionally, we show that semantic keypoints can be easily associated with the predicted shapes. We present qualitative and quantitative results of our approach on CUB and PASCAL3D datasets and show that we can learn to predict diverse shapes and textures across objects using only annotated image collections.

### 379.Thermal to Visible Synthesis of Face Images using Multiple Regions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07599.pdf)
> Synthesis of visible spectrum faces from thermal facial imagery is a promising approach for heterogeneous face recognition; enabling existing face recognition software trained on visible imagery to be leveraged, and allowing human analysts to verify cross-spectrum matches more effectively. We propose a new synthesis method to enhance the discriminative quality of synthesized visible face imagery by leveraging both global (e.g., entire face) and local regions (e.g., eyes, nose, and mouth). Here, each region provides (1) an independent representation for the corresponding area, and (2) additional regularization terms, which impact the overall quality of synthesized images. We analyze the effects of using multiple regions to synthesize a visible face image from a thermal face. We demonstrate that our approach improves cross-spectrum verification rates over recently published synthesis approaches. Moreover, using our synthesized imagery, we report the results on facial landmark detection-commonly used for image registration-which is a critical part of the face recognition process. 
### 380.A Survey of Deep Learning Techniques for Mobile Robot Applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07608.pdf)

This research survey will present a summarization of the current research with a specific focus on the gains and obstacles for deep learning to be applied to mobile robotics. 
### 381.Dynamic Sampling Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07624.pdf)
> We present Dynamic Sampling Convolutional Neural Networks (DSCNN), where the position-specific kernels learn from not only the current position but also multiple sampled neighbour regions. During sampling, residual learning is introduced to ease training and an attention mechanism is applied to fuse features from different samples. And the kernels are further factorized to reduce parameters. The multiple sampling strategy enlarges the effective receptive fields significantly without requiring more parameters. While DSCNNs inherit the advantages of DFN, namely avoiding feature map blurring by position-specific kernels while keeping translation invariance, it also efficiently alleviates the overfitting issue caused by much more parameters than normal CNNs. Our model is efficient and can be trained end-to-end via standard back-propagation. We demonstrate the merits of our DSCNNs on both sparse and dense prediction tasks involving object detection and flow estimation. Our results show that DSCNNs enjoy stronger recognition abilities and achieve 81.7% in VOC2012 detection dataset. Also, DSCNNs obtain much sharper responses in flow estimation on FlyingChairs dataset compared to multiple FlowNet models' baselines. 
### 382.A Feature-Driven Active Framework for Ultrasound-Based Brain Shift  Compensation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07682.pdf)
> A reliable Ultrasound (US)-to-US registration method to compensate for brain shift would substantially improve Image-Guided Neurological Surgery. Developing such a registration method is very challenging, due to factors such as missing correspondence in images, the complexity of brain pathology and the demand for fast computation. We propose a novel feature-driven active framework. Here, landmarks and their displacement are first estimated from a pair of US images using corresponding local image features. Subsequently, a Gaussian Process (GP) model is used to interpolate a dense deformation field from the sparse landmarks. Kernels of the GP are estimated by using variograms and a discrete grid search method. If necessary, the user can actively add new landmarks based on the image context and visualization of the uncertainty measure provided by the GP to further improve the result. We retrospectively demonstrate our registration framework as a robust and accurate brain shift compensation solution on clinical data acquired during neurosurgery. 
### 383.Robust Depth Estimation from Auto Bracketed Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07702.pdf)
> As demand for advanced photographic applications on hand-held devices grows, these electronics require the capture of high quality depth. However, under low-light conditions, most devices still suffer from low imaging quality and inaccurate depth acquisition. To address the problem, we present a robust depth estimation method from a short burst shot with varied intensity (i.e., Auto Bracketing) or strong noise (i.e., High ISO). We introduce a geometric transformation between flow and depth tailored for burst images, enabling our learning-based multi-view stereo matching to be performed effectively. We then describe our depth estimation pipeline that incorporates the geometric transformation into our residual-flow network. It allows our framework to produce an accurate depth map even with a bracketed image sequence. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for various datasets captured by a smartphone and a DSLR camera. Moreover, we show that the estimated depth is applicable for image quality enhancement and photographic editing. 
### 384.Weakly Supervised Medical Diagnosis and Localization from Multiple  Resolutions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07703.pdf)
> Diagnostic imaging often requires the simultaneous identification of a multitude of findings of varied size and appearance. Beyond global indication of said findings, the prediction and display of localization information improves trust in and understanding of results when augmenting clinical workflow. Medical training data rarely includes more than global image-level labels as segmentations are time-consuming and expensive to collect. We introduce an approach to managing these practical constraints by applying a novel architecture which learns at multiple resolutions while generating saliency maps with weak supervision. Further, we parameterize the Log-Sum-Exp pooling function with a learnable lower-bounded adaptation (LSE-LBA) to build in a sharpness prior and better handle localizing abnormalities of different sizes using only image-level labels. Applying this approach to interpreting chest x-rays, we set the state of the art on 9 abnormalities in the NIH's CXR14 dataset while generating saliency maps with the highest resolution to date. 
### 385.Generative Adversarial Talking Head: Bringing Portraits to Life with a  Weakly Supervised Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07716.pdf)
> This paper presents Generative Adversarial Talking Head (GATH), a novel deep generative neural network that enables fully automatic facial expression synthesis of an arbitrary portrait with continuous action unit (AU) coefficients. Specifically, our model directly manipulates image pixels to make the unseen subject in the still photo express various emotions controlled by values of facial AU coefficients, while maintaining her personal characteristics, such as facial geometry, skin color and hair style, as well as the original surrounding background. In contrast to prior work, GATH is purely data-driven and it requires neither a statistical face model nor image processing tricks to enact facial deformations. Additionally, our model is trained from unpaired data, where the input image, with its auxiliary identity label taken from abundance of still photos in the wild, and the target frame are from different persons. In order to effectively learn such model, we propose a novel weakly supervised adversarial learning framework that consists of a generator, a discriminator, a classifier and an action unit estimator. Our work gives rise to template-and-target-free expression editing, where still faces can be effortlessly animated with arbitrary AU coefficients provided by the user. 
### 386.Modeling Camera Effects to Improve Deep Vision for Real and Synthetic  Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07721.pdf)
> Recent work has focused on generating synthetic imagery and augmenting real imagery to increase the size and variability of training data for learning visual tasks in urban scenes. This includes increasing the occurrence of occlusions or varying environmental and weather effects. However, few have addressed modeling the variation in the sensor domain. Unfortunately, varying sensor effects can degrade performance and generalizability of results for visual tasks trained on human annotated datasets. This paper proposes an efficient, automated physically-based augmentation pipeline to vary sensor effects -- specifically, chromatic aberration, blur, exposure, noise, and color cast -- across both real and synthetic imagery. In particular, this paper illustrates that augmenting training datasets with the proposed pipeline improves the robustness and generalizability of object detection on a variety of benchmark vehicle datasets. 
### 387.Unsupervised Representation Learning by Predicting Image Rotations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07728.pdf)
> Over the last years, deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have transformed the field of computer vision thanks to their unparalleled capacity to learn high level semantic image features. However, in order to successfully learn those features, they usually require massive amounts of manually labeled data, which is both expensive and impractical to scale. Therefore, unsupervised semantic feature learning, i.e., learning without requiring manual annotation effort, is of crucial importance in order to successfully harvest the vast amount of visual data that are available today. In our work we propose to learn image features by training ConvNets to recognize the 2d rotation that is applied to the image that it gets as input. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that this apparently simple task actually provides a very powerful supervisory signal for semantic feature learning. We exhaustively evaluate our method in various unsupervised feature learning benchmarks and we exhibit in all of them state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, our results on those benchmarks demonstrate dramatic improvements w.r.t. prior state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised representation learning and thus significantly close the gap with supervised feature learning. For instance, in PASCAL VOC 2007 detection task our unsupervised pre-trained AlexNet model achieves the state-of-the-art (among unsupervised methods) mAP of 54.4% that is only 2.4 points lower from the supervised case. We get similarly striking results when we transfer our unsupervised learned features on various other tasks, such as ImageNet classification, PASCAL classification, PASCAL segmentation, and CIFAR-10 classification. The code and models of our paper will be published on: <a href="https://github.com/gidariss/FeatureLearningRotNet">this https URL</a> . 
### 388.Look Before You Leap: Bridging Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement  Learning for Planned-Ahead Vision-and-Language Navigation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07729.pdf)
> Existing research studies on vision and language grounding for robot navigation focus on improving model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models in synthetic environments. However, model-free DRL models do not consider the dynamics in the real-world environments, and they often fail to generalize to new scenes. In this paper, we take a radical approach to bridge the gap between synthetic studies and real-world practices---We propose a novel, planned-ahead hybrid reinforcement learning model that combines model-free and model-based reinforcement learning to solve a real-world vision-language navigation task. Our look-ahead module tightly integrates a look-ahead policy model with an environment model that predicts the next state and the reward. Experimental results suggest that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baselines and achieves the best on the real-world Room-to-Room dataset. Moreover, our scalable method is more generalizable when transferring to unseen environments. 
### 389.PyramidBox: A Context-assisted Single Shot Face Detector [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07737.pdf)
> Face detection has been well studied for many years and one of remaining challenges is to detect small, blurred and partially occluded faces in uncontrolled environment. This paper proposes a novel context-assisted single shot face detector, named \emph{PyramidBox} to handle the hard face detection problem. Observing the importance of the context, we improve the utilization of contextual information in the following three aspects. First, we design a novel context anchor to supervise high-level contextual feature learning by a semi-supervised method, which we call it PyramidAnchors. Second, we propose the Low-level Feature Pyramid Network to combine adequate high-level context semantic feature and Low-level facial feature together, which also allows the PyramidBox to predict faces of all scales in a single shot. Third, we introduce a context-sensitive structure to increase the capacity of prediction network to improve the final accuracy of output. In addition, we use the method of Data-anchor-sampling to augment the training samples across different scales, which increases the diversity of training data for smaller faces. By exploiting the value of context, PyramidBox achieves superior performance among the state-of-the-art over the two common face detection benchmarks, FDDB and WIDER FACE. Our code is available in PaddlePaddle: \href{https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/models/tree/develop/fluid/face_detection}{\url{<a href="https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/models/tree/develop/fluid/face_detection">this https URL</a>}}. 
### 390.Assessing Shape Bias Property of Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07739.pdf)
> It is known that humans display "shape bias" when classifying new items, i.e., they prefer to categorize objects based on their shape rather than color. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are also designed to take into account the spatial structure of image data. In fact, experiments on image datasets, consisting of triples of a probe image, a shape-match and a color-match, have shown that one-shot learning models display shape bias as well. <br />In this paper, we examine the shape bias property of CNNs. In order to conduct large scale experiments, we propose using the model accuracy on images with reversed brightness as a metric to evaluate the shape bias property. Such images, called negative images, contain objects that have the same shape as original images, but with different colors. Through extensive systematic experiments, we investigate the role of different factors, such as training data, model architecture, initialization and regularization techniques, on the shape bias property of CNNs. We show that it is possible to design different CNNs that achieve similar accuracy on original images, but perform significantly different on negative images, suggesting that CNNs do not intrinsically display shape bias. We then show that CNNs are able to learn and generalize the structures, when the model is properly initialized or data is properly augmented, and if batch normalization is used. 
### 391.Fast Semantic Segmentation on Video Using Motion Vector-Based Feature  Interpolation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07742.pdf)
> Models optimized for accuracy on challenging, dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation entail significant inference costs, and are prohibitively slow to run on each frame in a video. Since nearby video frames are spatially similar, however, there is substantial opportunity to reuse computation. Existing work has explored basic feature reuse and feature warping based on optical flow, but has encountered limits to the speedup attainable with these techniques. In this paper, we present a new, two part approach to accelerating inference on video. Firstly, we propose a fast feature propagation scheme that utilizes the block motion vector maps present in compressed video to cheaply propagate features from frame to frame. Secondly, we develop a novel feature estimation scheme, termed feature interpolation, that fuses features propagated from enclosing keyframes to render accurate feature estimates, even at sparse keyframe frequencies. We evaluate our system on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, comparing to both a frame-by-frame baseline and related work. We find that we are able to substantially accelerate segmentation on video, achieving twice the average inference speed as prior work at any target accuracy level. 
### 392.Learning and Recognizing Human Action from Skeleton Movement with Deep  Residual Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07780.pdf)
> Automatic human action recognition is indispensable for almost artificial intelligent systems such as video surveillance, human-computer interfaces, video retrieval, etc. Despite a lot of progress, recognizing actions in an unknown video is still a challenging task in computer vision. Recently, deep learning algorithms have proved its great potential in many vision-related recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose the use of Deep Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) to learn and recognize human action from skeleton data provided by Kinect sensor. Firstly, the body joint coordinates are transformed into 3D-arrays and saved in RGB images space. Five different deep learning models based on ResNet have been designed to extract image features and classify them into classes. Experiments are conducted on two public video datasets for human action recognition containing various challenges. The results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance comparing with existing approaches. 
### 393.Exploiting deep residual networks for human action recognition from  skeletal data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07781.pdf)
> The computer vision community is currently focusing on solving action recognition problems in real videos, which contain thousands of samples with many challenges. In this process, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (D-CNNs) have played a significant role in advancing the state-of-the-art in various vision-based action recognition systems. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional CNN model in a single architecture called Residual Network (ResNet) has shown impressive performance and great potential for image recognition tasks. In this paper, we investigate and apply deep ResNets for human action recognition using skeletal data provided by depth sensors. Firstly, the 3D coordinates of the human body joints carried in skeleton sequences are transformed into image-based representations and stored as RGB images. These color images are able to capture the spatial-temporal evolutions of 3D motions from skeleton sequences and can be efficiently learned by D-CNNs. We then propose a novel deep learning architecture based on ResNets to learn features from obtained color-based representations and classify them into action classes. The proposed method is evaluated on three challenging benchmark datasets including MSR Action 3D, KARD, and NTU-RGB+D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for all these benchmarks whilst requiring less computation resource. In particular, the proposed method surpasses previous approaches by a significant margin of 3.4% on MSR Action 3D dataset, 0.67% on KARD dataset, and 2.5% on NTU-RGB+D dataset. 
### 394.Domain Adaptation for Ear Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07801.pdf)
> In this paper, we have extensively investigated the unconstrained ear recognition problem. We have first shown the importance of domain adaptation, when deep convolutional neural network models are used for ear recognition. To enable domain adaptation, we have collected a new ear dataset using the Multi-PIE face dataset, which we named as Multi-PIE ear dataset. To improve the performance further, we have combined different deep convolutional neural network models. We have analyzed in depth the effect of ear image quality, for example illumination and aspect ratio, on the classification performance. Finally, we have addressed the problem of dataset bias in the ear recognition field. Experiments on the UERC dataset have shown that domain adaptation leads to a significant performance improvement. For example, when VGG-16 model is used and the domain adaptation is applied, an absolute increase of around 10\% has been achieved. Combining different deep convolutional neural network models has further improved the accuracy by 4\%. It has also been observed that image quality has an influence on the results. In the experiments that we have conducted to examine the dataset bias, given an ear image, we were able to classify the dataset that it has come from with 99.71\% accuracy, which indicates a strong bias among the ear recognition datasets. 
### 395.Patch-based Fake Fingerprint Detection Using a Fully Convolutional  Neural Network with a Small Number of Parameters and an Optimal Threshold [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07817.pdf)
> Fingerprint authentication is widely used in biometrics due to its simple process, but it is vulnerable to fake fingerprints. This study proposes a patch-based fake fingerprint detection method using a fully convolutional neural network with a small number of parameters and an optimal threshold to solve the above-mentioned problem. Unlike the existing methods that classify a fingerprint as live or fake, the proposed method classifies fingerprints as fake, live, or background, so preprocessing methods such as segmentation are not needed. The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) structure applies the Fire module of SqueezeNet, and the fewer parameters used require only 2.0 MB of memory. The network that has completed training is applied to the training data in a fully convolutional way, and the optimal threshold to distinguish fake fingerprints is determined, which is used in the final test. As a result of this study experiment, the proposed method showed an average classification error of 1.35%, demonstrating a fake fingerprint detection method using a high-performance CNN with a small number of parameters. 
### 396.End-to-End Fingerprints Liveness Detection using Convolutional Networks  with Gram module [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07830.pdf)
> This paper proposes an end-to-end CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) model that uses gram modules with parameters that are approximately 1.2MB in size to detect fake fingerprints. The proposed method assumes that texture is the most appropriate characteristic in fake fingerprint detection, and implements the gram module to extract textures from the CNN. The proposed CNN structure uses the fire module as the base model and uses the gram module for texture extraction. Tensors that passed the fire module will be joined with gram modules to create a gram matrix with the same spatial size. After 3 gram matrices extracted from different layers are combined with the channel axis, it becomes the basis for categorizing fake fingerprints. The experiment results had an average detection error of 2.61% from the LivDet 2011, 2013, 2015 data, proving that an end-to-end CNN structure with few parameters that is able to be used in fake fingerprint detection can be designed. 
### 397.Joint 3D Face Reconstruction and Dense Alignment with Position Map  Regression Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07835.pdf)
> We propose a straightforward method that simultaneously reconstructs the 3D facial structure and provides dense alignment. To achieve this, we design a 2D representation called UV position map which records the 3D shape of a complete face in UV space, then train a simple Convolutional Neural Network to regress it from a single 2D image. We also integrate a weight mask into the loss function during training to improve the performance of the network. Our method does not rely on any prior face model, and can reconstruct full facial geometry along with semantic meaning. Meanwhile, our network is very light-weighted and spends only 9.8ms to process an image, which is extremely faster than previous works. Experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method surpasses other state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction and alignment tasks by a large margin. 
### 398.HATS: Histograms of Averaged Time Surfaces for Robust Event-based Object  Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07913.pdf)
> Event-based cameras have recently drawn the attention of the Computer Vision community thanks to their advantages in terms of high temporal resolution, low power consumption and high dynamic range, compared to traditional frame-based cameras. These properties make event-based cameras an ideal choice for autonomous vehicles, robot navigation or UAV vision, among others. However, the accuracy of event-based object classification algorithms, which is of crucial importance for any reliable system working in real-world conditions, is still far behind their frame-based counterparts. Two main reasons for this performance gap are: 1. The lack of effective low-level representations and architectures for event-based object classification and 2. The absence of large real-world event-based datasets. In this paper we address both problems. First, we introduce a novel event-based feature representation together with a new machine learning architecture. Compared to previous approaches, we use local memory units to efficiently leverage past temporal information and build a robust event-based representation. Second, we release the first large real-world event-based dataset for object classification. We compare our method to the state-of-the-art with extensive experiments, showing better classification performance and real-time computation. 
### 399.Modelling the Influence of Cultural Information on Vision-Based Human  Home Activity Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07915.pdf)
> Daily life activities, such as eating and sleeping, are deeply influenced by a person's culture, hence generating differences in the way a same activity is performed by individuals belonging to different cultures. We argue that taking cultural information into account can improve the performance of systems for the automated recognition of human activities. We propose four different solutions to the problem and present a system which uses a Naive Bayes model to associate cultural information with semantic information extracted from still images. Preliminary experiments with a dataset of images of individuals lying on the floor, sleeping on a futon and sleeping on a bed suggest that: i) solutions explicitly taking cultural information into account are more accurate than culture-unaware solutions; and ii) the proposed system is a promising starting point for the development of culture-aware Human Activity Recognition methods. 
### 400.End-to-End Video Captioning with Multitask Reinforcement Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07950.pdf)
> Although end-to-end (E2E) learning has led to promising performance on a variety of tasks, it is often impeded by hardware constraints (e.g., GPU memories) and is prone to overfitting. When it comes to video captioning, one of the most challenging benchmark tasks in computer vision and machine learning, those limitations of E2E learning are especially amplified by the fact that both the input videos and output captions are lengthy sequences. Indeed, state-of-the-art methods of video captioning process video frames by convolutional neural networks and generate captions by unrolling recurrent neural networks. If we connect them in an E2E manner, the resulting model is both memory-consuming and data-hungry, making it extremely hard to train. In this paper, we propose a multitask reinforcement learning approach to training an E2E video captioning model. The main idea is to mine and construct as many effective tasks (e.g., attributes, rewards, and the captions) as possible from the human captioned videos such that they can jointly regulate the search space of the E2E neural network, from which an E2E video captioning model can be found and generalized to the testing phase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first video captioning model that is trained end-to-end from the raw video input to the caption output. Experimental results show that such a model outperforms existing ones to a large margin on two benchmark video captioning datasets. 
### 401.A Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network for Single Image Dehazing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07955.pdf)
> Images captured under outdoor scenes usually suffer from low contrast and limited visibility due to suspended atmospheric particles, which directly affects the quality of photos. Despite numerous image dehazing methods have been proposed, effective hazy image restoration remains a challenging problem. Existing learning-based methods usually predict the medium transmission by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but ignore the key global atmospheric light. Different from previous learning-based methods, we propose a flexible cascaded CNN for single hazy image restoration, which considers the medium transmission and global atmospheric light jointly by two task-driven subnetworks. Specifically, the medium transmission estimation subnetwork is inspired by the densely connected CNN while the global atmospheric light estimation subnetwork is a light-weight CNN. Besides, these two subnetworks are cascaded by sharing the common features. Finally, with the estimated model parameters, the haze-free image is obtained by the atmospheric scattering model inversion, which achieves more accurate and effective restoration performance. Qualitatively and quantitatively experimental results on the synthetic and real-world hazy images demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes haze from such images, and outperforms several state-of-the-art dehazing methods. 
### 402.Non-rigid 3D Shape Registration using an Adaptive Template [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07973.pdf)
> We present a new fully-automatic non-rigid 3D shape registration (morphing) framework comprising (1) a new 3D landmarking and pose normalisation method; (2) an adaptive shape template method to accelerate the convergence of registration algorithms and achieve a better final shape correspondence and (3) a new iterative registration method that combines Iterative Closest Points with Coherent Point Drift (CPD) to achieve a more stable and accurate correspondence establishment than standard CPD. We call this new morphing approach Iterative Coherent Point Drift (ICPD). Our proposed framework is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets: Headspace, BU3D and MPI-FAUST and compared with several other methods. The proposed framework is shown to give state-of-the-art performance. 
### 403.BioTracker: An Open-Source Computer Vision Framework for Visual Animal  Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07985.pdf)
> The study of animal behavior increasingly relies on (semi-) automatic methods for the extraction of relevant behavioral features from video or picture data. To date, several specialized software products exist to detect and track animals' positions in simple (laboratory) environments. Tracking animals in their natural environments, however, often requires substantial customization of the image processing algorithms to the problem-specific image characteristics. Here we introduce BioTracker, an open-source computer vision framework, that provides programmers with core functionalities that are essential parts of a tracking software, such as video I/O, graphics overlays and mouse and keyboard interfaces. BioTracker additionally provides a number of different tracking algorithms suitable for a variety of image recording conditions. The main feature of BioTracker is however the straightforward implementation of new problem-specific tracking modules and vision algorithms that can build upon BioTracker's core functionalities. With this open-source framework the scientific community can accelerate their research and focus on the development of new vision algorithms. 
### 404.Quantification of Lung Abnormalities in Cystic Fibrosis using Deep  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07991.pdf)
> Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease which may appear in early life with structural abnormalities in lung tissues. We propose to detect these abnormalities using a texture classification approach. Our method is a cascade of two convolutional neural networks. The first network detects the presence of abnormal tissues. The second network identifies the type of the structural abnormalities: bronchiectasis, atelectasis or mucus plugging.We also propose a network computing pixel-wise heatmaps of abnormality presence learning only from the patch-wise annotations. Our database consists of CT scans of 194 subjects. We use 154 subjects to train our algorithms and the 40 remaining ones as a test set. We compare our method with random forest and a single neural network approach. The first network reaches an accuracy of 0,94 for disease detection, 0,18 higher than the random forest classifier and 0,37 higher than the single neural network. Our cascade approach yields a final class-averaged F1-score of 0,33, outperforming the baseline method and the single network by 0,10 and 0,12. 
### 405.Video Object Segmentation with Language Referring Expressions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08006.pdf)
> Most state-of-the-art semi-supervised video object segmentation methods rely on a pixel-accurate mask of a target object provided for the first frame of a video. However, obtaining a detailed segmentation mask is expensive and time-consuming. In this work we explore an alternative way of identifying a target object, namely by employing language referring expressions. Besides being a more practical and natural way of pointing out a target object, using language specifications can help to avoid drift as well as make the system more robust to complex dynamics and appearance variations. Leveraging recent advances of language grounding models designed for images, we propose an approach to extend them to video data, ensuring temporally coherent predictions. To evaluate our method we augment the popular video object segmentation benchmarks, DAVIS'16 and DAVIS'17 with language descriptions of target objects. We show that our approach performs on par with the methods which have access to a pixel-level mask of the target object on DAVIS'16 and is competitive to methods using scribbles on the challenging DAVIS'17 dataset. 
### 406.Monocular Depth Estimation by Learning from Heterogeneous Datasets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08018.pdf)
> Depth estimation provides essential information to perform autonomous driving and driver assistance. Especially, Monocular Depth Estimation is interesting from a practical point of view, since using a single camera is cheaper than many other options and avoids the need for continuous calibration strategies as required by stereo-vision approaches. State-of-the-art methods for Monocular Depth Estimation are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A promising line of work consists of introducing additional semantic information about the traffic scene when training CNNs for depth estimation. In practice, this means that the depth data used for CNN training is complemented with images having pixel-wise semantic labels, which usually are difficult to annotate (e.g. crowded urban images). Moreover, so far it is common practice to assume that the same raw training data is associated with both types of ground truth, i.e., depth and semantic labels. The main contribution of this paper is to show that this hard constraint can be circumvented, i.e., that we can train CNNs for depth estimation by leveraging the depth and semantic information coming from heterogeneous datasets. In order to illustrate the benefits of our approach, we combine KITTI depth and Cityscapes semantic segmentation datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art results on Monocular Depth Estimation. 
### 407.Stacked Cross Attention for Image-Text Matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08024.pdf)
> In this paper, we study the problem of image-text matching. Inferring the latent semantic alignment between objects or other salient stuff (e.g. snow, sky, lawn) and the corresponding words in sentences allows to capture fine-grained interplay between vision and language, and makes image-text matching more interpretable. Prior work either simply aggregates the similarity of all possible pairs of regions and words without attending differentially to more and less important words or regions, or uses a multi-step attentional process to capture limited number of semantic alignments which is less interpretable. In this paper, we present Stacked Cross Attention to discover the full latent alignments using both image regions and words in a sentence as context and infer image-text similarity. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets. On Flickr30K, our approach outperforms the current best methods by 22.1% relatively in text retrieval from image query, and 18.2% relatively in image retrieval with text query (based on Recall@1). On MS-COCO, our approach improves sentence retrieval by 17.8% relatively and image retrieval by 16.6% relatively (based on Recall@1 using the 5K test set).

### 408.Zero-shot Recognition via Semantic Embeddings and Knowledge Graphs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08035.pdf)
> We consider the problem of zero-shot recognition: learning a visual classifier for a category with zero training examples, just using the word embedding of the category and its relationship to other categories, which visual data are provided. The key to dealing with the unfamiliar or novel category is to transfer knowledge obtained from familiar classes to describe the unfamiliar class. In this paper, we build upon the recently introduced Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and propose an approach that uses both semantic embeddings and the categorical relationships to predict the classifiers. Given a learned knowledge graph (KG), our approach takes as input semantic embeddings for each node (representing visual category). After a series of graph convolutions, we predict the visual classifier for each category. During training, the visual classifiers for a few categories are given to learn the GCN parameters. At test time, these filters are used to predict the visual classifiers of unseen categories. We show that our approach is robust to noise in the KG. More importantly, our approach provides significant improvement in performance compared to the current state-of-the-art results (from 2 ~ 3% on some metrics to whopping 20% on a few). 
### 409.Eigendecomposition-free Training of Deep Networks with Zero  Eigenvalue-based Losses [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08071.pdf)
> Many classical Computer Vision problems, such as essential matrix computation and pose estimation from 3D to 2D correspondences, can be solved by finding the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest, or zero, eigenvalue of a matrix representing a linear system. Incorporating this in deep learning frameworks would allow us to explicitly encode known notions of geometry, instead of having the network implicitly learn them from data. However, performing eigendecomposition within a network requires the ability to differentiate this operation. Unfortunately, while theoretically doable, this introduces numerical instability in the optimization process in practice. <br />In this paper, we introduce an eigendecomposition-free approach to training a deep network whose loss depends on the eigenvector corresponding to a zero eigenvalue of a matrix predicted by the network. We demonstrate on several tasks, including keypoint matching and 3D pose estimation, that our approach is much more robust than explicit differentiation of the eigendecomposition, It has better convergence properties and yields state-of-the-art results on both tasks. 
### 410.Probabilistic Video Generation using Holistic Attribute Control [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08085.pdf)
> Videos express highly structured spatio-temporal patterns of visual data. A video can be thought of as being governed by two factors: (i) temporally invariant (e.g., person identity), or slowly varying (e.g., activity), attribute-induced appearance, encoding the persistent content of each frame, and (ii) an inter-frame motion or scene dynamics (e.g., encoding evolution of the person ex-ecuting the action). Based on this intuition, we propose a generative framework for video generation and future prediction. The proposed framework generates a video (short clip) by decoding samples sequentially drawn from a latent space distribution into full video frames. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are used as a means of encoding/decoding frames into/from the latent space and RNN as a wayto model the dynamics in the latent space. We improve the video generation consistency through temporally-conditional sampling and quality by structuring the latent space with attribute controls; ensuring that attributes can be both inferred and conditioned on during learning/generation. As a result, given attributes and/orthe first frame, our model is able to generate diverse but highly consistent sets ofvideo sequences, accounting for the inherent uncertainty in the prediction task. Experimental results on Chair CAD, Weizmann Human Action, and MIT-Flickr datasets, along with detailed comparison to the state-of-the-art, verify effectiveness of the framework. 
### 411.T-RECS: Training for Rate-Invariant Embeddings by Controlling Speed for  Action Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08094.pdf)
> An action should remain identifiable when modifying its speed: consider the contrast between an expert chef and a novice chef each chopping an onion. Here, we expect the novice chef to have a relatively measured and slow approach to chopping when compared to the expert. In general, the speed at which actions are performed, whether slower or faster than average, should not dictate how they are recognized. We explore the erratic behavior caused by this phenomena on state-of-the-art deep network-based methods for action recognition in terms of maximum performance and stability in recognition accuracy across a range of input video speeds. By observing the trends in these metrics and summarizing them based on expected temporal behaviour w.r.t. variations in input video speeds, we find two distinct types of network architectures. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing method named T-RECS, as a way to extend deep-network-based methods for action recognition to explicitly account for speed variability in the data. We do so by adaptively resampling the inputs to a given model. T-RECS is agnostic to the specific deep-network model; we apply it to four state-of-the-art action recognition architectures, C3D, I3D, TSN, and ConvNet+LSTM. On HMDB51 and UCF101, T-RECS-based I3D models show a peak improvement of at least 2.9% in performance over the baseline while T-RECS-based C3D models achieve a maximum improvement in stability by 59% over the baseline, on the HMDB51 dataset. 
### 412.A Unified Framework for Multi-View Multi-Class Object Pose Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08103.pdf)
> One core challenge in object pose estimation is to ensure accurate and robust performance for large numbers of diverse foreground objects amidst complex background clutter. In this work, we present a scalable framework for accurately inferring six Degree-of-Freedom (6-DoF) pose for a large number of object classes from single or multiple views. To learn discriminative pose features, we integrate three new capabilities into a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): an inference scheme that combines both classification and pose regression based on a uniform tessellation of SE(3), fusion of a class prior into the training process via a tiled class map, and an additional regularization using deep supervision with an object mask. Further, an efficient multi-view framework is formulated to address single-view ambiguity. We show this consistently improves the performance of the single-view network. We evaluate our method on three large-scale benchmarks: YCB-Video, JHUScene-50 and ObjectNet-3D. Our approach achieves competitive or superior performance over the current state-of-the-art methods. 
### 413.Fisher Pruning of Deep Nets for Facial Trait Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08134.pdf)
> Although deep nets have resulted in high accuracies for various visual tasks, their computational and space requirements are prohibitively high for inclusion on devices without high-end GPUs. In this paper, we introduce a neuron/filter level pruning framework based on Fisher's LDA which leads to high accuracies for a wide array of facial trait classification tasks, while significantly reducing space/computational complexities. The approach is general and can be applied to convolutional, fully-connected, and module-based deep structures, in all cases leveraging the high decorrelation of neuron activations found in the pre-decision layer and cross-layer deconv dependency. Experimental results on binary and multi-category facial traits from the LFWA and Adience datasets illustrate the framework's comparable/better performance to state-of-the-art pruning approaches and compact structures (e.g. SqueezeNet, MobileNet). Ours successfully maintains comparable accuracies even after discarding most parameters (98%-99% for VGG-16, 82% for GoogLeNet) and with significant FLOP reductions (83% for VGG-16, 64% for GoogLeNet). 
### 414.Robust Blind Deconvolution via Mirror Descent [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08137.pdf)
> We revisit the Blind Deconvolution problem with a focus on understanding its robustness and convergence properties. Provable robustness to noise and other perturbations is receiving recent interest in vision, from obtaining immunity to adversarial attacks to assessing and describing failure modes of algorithms in mission critical applications. Further, many blind deconvolution methods based on deep architectures internally make use of or optimize the basic formulation, so a clearer understanding of how this sub-module behaves, when it can be solved, and what noise injection it can tolerate is a first order requirement. We derive new insights into the theoretical underpinnings of blind deconvolution. The algorithm that emerges has nice convergence guarantees and is provably robust in a sense we formalize in the paper. Interestingly, these technical results play out very well in practice, where on standard datasets our algorithm yields results competitive with or superior to the state of the art. Keywords: blind deconvolution, robust continuous optimization 
### 415.Extended depth-of-field in holographic image reconstruction using deep  learning based auto-focusing and phase-recovery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08138.pdf)
> Holography encodes the three dimensional (3D) information of a sample in the form of an intensity-only recording. However, to decode the original sample image from its hologram(s), auto-focusing and phase-recovery are needed, which are in general cumbersome and time-consuming to digitally perform. Here we demonstrate a convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach that simultaneously performs auto-focusing and phase-recovery to significantly extend the depth-of-field (DOF) in holographic image reconstruction. For this, a CNN is trained by using pairs of randomly de-focused back-propagated holograms and their corresponding in-focus phase-recovered images. After this training phase, the CNN takes a single back-propagated hologram of a 3D sample as input to rapidly achieve phase-recovery and reconstruct an in focus image of the sample over a significantly extended DOF. This deep learning based DOF extension method is non-iterative, and significantly improves the algorithm time-complexity of holographic image reconstruction from O(nm) to O(1), where n refers to the number of individual object points or particles within the sample volume, and m represents the focusing search space within which each object point or particle needs to be individually focused. These results highlight some of the unique opportunities created by data-enabled statistical image reconstruction methods powered by machine learning, and we believe that the presented approach can be broadly applicable to computationally extend the DOF of other imaging modalities. 
### 416.Deep Pose Consensus Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08190.pdf)
> In this paper, we address the problem of estimating a 3D human pose from a single image, which is important but difficult to solve due to many reasons, such as self-occlusions, wild appearance changes, and inherent ambiguities of 3D estimation from a 2D cue. These difficulties make the problem ill-posed, which have become requiring increasingly complex estimators to enhance the performance. On the other hand, most existing methods try to handle this problem based on a single complex estimator, which might not be good solutions. In this paper, to resolve this issue, we propose a multiple-partial-hypothesis-based framework for the problem of estimating 3D human pose from a single image, which can be fine-tuned in an end-to-end fashion. We first select several joint groups from a human joint model using the proposed sampling scheme, and estimate the 3D poses of each joint group separately based on deep neural networks. After that, they are aggregated to obtain the final 3D poses using the proposed robust optimization formula. The overall procedure can be fine-tuned in an end-to-end fashion, resulting in better performance. In the experiments, the proposed framework shows the state-of-the-art performances on popular benchmark data sets, namely Human3.6M and HumanEva, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. 
### 417.Single-Shot Bidirectional Pyramid Networks for High-Quality Object  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08208.pdf)
> Recent years have witnessed many exciting achievements for object detection using deep learning techniques. Despite achieving significant progresses, most existing detectors are designed to detect objects with relatively low-quality prediction of locations, i.e., often trained with the threshold of Intersection over Union (IoU) set to 0.5 by default, which can yield low-quality or even noisy detections. It remains an open challenge for how to devise and train a high-quality detector that can achieve more precise localization (i.e., IoU$&gt;$0.5) without sacrificing the detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel single-shot detection framework of Bidirectional Pyramid Networks (BPN) towards high-quality object detection, which consists of two novel components: (i) a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid structure for more effective and robust feature representations; and (ii) a Cascade Anchor Refinement to gradually refine the quality of predesigned anchors for more effective training. Our experiments showed that the proposed BPN achieves the best performances among all the single-stage object detectors on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets, especially for high-quality detections. 
### 418.PersonLab: Person Pose Estimation and Instance Segmentation with a  Bottom-Up, Part-Based, Geometric Embedding Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08225.pdf)
> We present a box-free bottom-up approach for the tasks of pose estimation and instance segmentation of people in multi-person images using an efficient single-shot model. The proposed PersonLab model tackles both semantic-level reasoning and object-part associations using part-based modeling. Our model employs a convolutional network which learns to detect individual keypoints and predict their relative displacements, allowing us to group keypoints into person pose instances. Further, we propose a part-induced geometric embedding descriptor which allows us to associate semantic person pixels with their corresponding person instance, delivering instance-level person segmentations. Our system is based on a fully-convolutional architecture and allows for efficient inference, with runtime essentially independent of the number of people present in the scene. Trained on COCO data alone, our system achieves COCO test-dev keypoint average precision of 0.665 using single-scale inference and 0.687 using multi-scale inference, significantly outperforming all previous bottom-up pose estimation systems. We are also the first bottom-up method to report competitive results for the person class in the COCO instance segmentation task, achieving a person category average precision of 0.417. 
### 419.Unsupervised Adversarial Learning of 3D Human Pose from 2D Joint  Locations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08244.pdf)
> The task of three-dimensional (3D) human pose estimation from a single image can be divided into two parts: (1) Two-dimensional (2D) human joint detection from the image and (2) estimating a 3D pose from the 2D joints. Herein, we focus on the second part, i.e., a 3D pose estimation from 2D joint locations. The problem with existing methods is that they require either (1) a 3D pose dataset or (2) 2D joint locations in consecutive frames taken from a video sequence. We aim to solve these problems. For the first time, we propose a method that learns a 3D human pose without any 3D datasets. Our method can predict a 3D pose from 2D joint locations in a single image. Our system is based on the generative adversarial networks, and the networks are trained in an unsupervised manner. Our primary idea is that, if the network can predict a 3D human pose correctly, the 3D pose that is projected onto a 2D plane should not collapse even if it is rotated perpendicularly. We evaluated the performance of our method using Human3.6M and the MPII dataset and showed that our network can predict a 3D pose well even if the 3D dataset is not available during training. 
### 420.Show, Tell and Discriminate: Image Captioning by Self-retrieval with  Partially Labeled Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08314.pdf)
> The aim of image captioning is to generate captions by machine to describe image contents. Despite many efforts, generating discriminative captions for images remains non-trivial. Most traditional approaches imitate the language structure patterns, thus tend to fall into a stereotype of replicating frequent phrases or sentences and neglect unique aspects of each image. In this work, we propose an image captioning framework with a self-retrieval module as training guidance, which encourages generating discriminative captions. It brings unique advantages: (1) the self-retrieval guidance can act as a metric and an evaluator of caption discriminativeness to assure the quality of generated captions. (2) The correspondence between generated captions and images are naturally incorporated in the generation process without human annotations, and hence our approach could utilize a large amount of unlabeled images to boost captioning performance with no additional laborious annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed retrieval-guided method on COCO and Flickr30k captioning datasets, and show its superior captioning performance with more discriminative captions. 
### 421.Learning to Detect and Track Visible and Occluded Body Joints in a  Virtual World [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08319.pdf)
> Multi-People Tracking in an open-world setting requires a special effort in precise detection. Moreover, temporal continuity in the detection phase gains more importance when scene cluttering introduces the challenging problems of occluded targets. For the purpose, we propose a deep network architecture that jointly extracts people body parts and associates them across short temporal spans. Our model explicitly deals with occluded body parts, by hallucinating plausible solutions of not visible joints. We propose a new end-to-end architecture composed by four branches (\textit{visible heatmaps}, \textit{occluded heatmaps}, \textit{part affinity fields} and \textit{temporal affinity fields}) fed by a \textit{time linker} feature extractor. To overcome the lack of surveillance data with tracking, body part and occlusion annotations we created the vastest Computer Graphics dataset for people tracking in urban scenarios by exploiting a photorealistic videogame. It is up to now the vastest dataset (about 500.000 frames, more than 10 million body poses) of human body parts for people tracking in urban scenarios. Our architecture trained on virtual data exhibits good generalization capabilities also on public real tracking benchmarks, when image resolution and sharpness are high enough, producing reliable tracklets useful for further batch data association or re-id modules. 
### 422.Prioritized Multi-View Stereo Depth Map Generation Using Confidence  Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08323.pdf)
> In this work, we propose a novel approach to prioritize the depth map computation of multi-view stereo (MVS) to obtain compact 3D point clouds of high quality and completeness at low computational cost. Our prioritization approach operates before the MVS algorithm is executed and consists of two steps. In the first step, we aim to find a good set of matching partners for each view. In the second step, we rank the resulting view clusters (i.e. key views with matching partners) according to their impact on the fulfillment of desired quality parameters such as completeness, ground resolution and accuracy. Additional to geometric analysis, we use a novel machine learning technique for training a confidence predictor. The purpose of this confidence predictor is to estimate the chances of a successful depth reconstruction for each pixel in each image for one specific MVS algorithm based on the RGB images and the image constellation. The underlying machine learning technique does not require any ground truth or manually labeled data for training, but instead adapts ideas from depth map fusion for providing a supervision signal. The trained confidence predictor allows us to evaluate the quality of image constellations and their potential impact to the resulting 3D reconstruction and thus builds a solid foundation for our prioritization approach. In our experiments, we are thus able to reach more than 70% of the maximal reachable quality fulfillment using only 5% of the available images as key views. For evaluating our approach within and across different domains, we use two completely different scenarios, i.e. cultural heritage preservation and reconstruction of single family houses. 
### 423.Dichromatic Gray Pixel for Camera-agnostic Color Constancy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08326.pdf)
> We present a statistical color constancy method that relies on novel gray pixel detection and mean shift clustering. The method, called Mean Shifted Grey Pixel -- MSGP -- is compact, easy to compute and requires no training. Experiments on different datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the camera-agnostic scenario. In the setting where the camera is known, MSGP outperforms all statistical methods. 
### 424.What do Deep Networks Like to See? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08337.pdf)
> We propose a novel way to measure and understand convolutional neural networks by quantifying the amount of input signal they let in. To do this, an autoencoder (AE) was fine-tuned on gradients from a pre-trained classifier with fixed parameters. We compared the reconstructed samples from AEs that were fine-tuned on a set of image classifiers (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet-50, and Inception~v3) and found substantial differences. The AE learns which aspects of the input space to preserve and which ones to ignore, based on the information encoded in the backpropagated gradients. Measuring the changes in accuracy when the signal of one classifier is used by a second one, a relation of total order emerges. This order depends directly on each classifier's input signal but it does not correlate with classification accuracy or network size. Further evidence of this phenomenon is provided by measuring the normalized mutual information between original images and auto-encoded reconstructions from different fine-tuned AEs. These findings break new ground in the area of neural network understanding, opening a new way to reason, debug, and interpret their results. We present four concrete examples in the literature where observations can now be explained in terms of the input signal that a model uses. 
### 425.Found a good match: should I keep searching? - Accuracy and Performance  in Iris Matching Using 1-to-First Search [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08394.pdf)
> Iris recognition is used in many applications around the world, with enrollment sizes as large as over one billion persons in India's Aadhaar program. Large enrollment sizes can require special optimizations in order to achieve fast database searches. One such optimization that has been used in some operational scenarios is 1:First search. In this approach, instead of scanning the entire database, the search is terminated when the first sufficiently good match is found. This saves time, but ignores potentially better matches that may exist in the unexamined portion of the enrollments. At least one prominent and successful border-crossing program used this approach for nearly a decade, in order to allow users a fast "token-free" search. Our work investigates the search accuracy of 1:First and compares it to the traditional 1:N search. Several different scenarios are considered trying to emulate real environments as best as possible: a range of enrollment sizes, closed- and open-set configurations, two iris matchers, and different permutations of the galleries. Results confirm the expected accuracy degradation using 1:First search, and also allow us to identify acceptable working parameters where significant search time reduction is achieved, while maintaining accuracy similar to 1:N search. 
### 426.Densely Connected Pyramid Dehazing Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08396.pdf)
> We propose a new end-to-end single image dehazing method, called Densely Connected Pyramid Dehazing Network (DCPDN), which can jointly learn the transmission map, atmospheric light and dehazing all together. The end-to-end learning is achieved by directly embedding the atmospheric scattering model into the network, thereby ensuring that the proposed method strictly follows the physics-driven scattering model for dehazing. Inspired by the dense network that can maximize the information flow along features from different levels, we propose a new edge-preserving densely connected encoder-decoder structure with multi-level pyramid pooling module for estimating the transmission map. This network is optimized using a newly introduced edge-preserving loss function. To further incorporate the mutual structural information between the estimated transmission map and the dehazed result, we propose a joint-discriminator based on generative adversarial network framework to decide whether the corresponding dehazed image and the estimated transmission map are real or fake. An ablation study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module evaluated at both estimated transmission map and dehazed result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Code will be made available at: <a href="https://github.com/hezhangsprinter">this https URL</a> 
### 427.PlaneMatch: Patch Coplanarity Prediction for Robust RGB-D Reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08407.pdf)
> We introduce a novel RGB-D patch descriptor designed for detecting coplanar surfaces in SLAM reconstruction. The core of our method is a deep convolutional neural net that takes in RGB, depth, and normal information of a planar patch in an image and outputs a descriptor that can be used to find coplanar patches from other images.We train the network on 10 million triplets of coplanar and non-coplanar patches, and evaluate on a new coplanarity benchmark created from commodity RGB-D scans. Experiments show that our learned descriptor outperforms alternatives extended for this new task by a significant margin. In addition, we demonstrate the benefits of coplanarity matching in a robust RGBD reconstruction formulation.We find that coplanarity constraints detected with our method are sufficient to get reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art frameworks on most scenes, but outperform other methods on standard benchmarks when combined with a simple keypoint method. 
### 428.A Smoke Removal Method for Laparoscopic Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08410.pdf)
> In laparoscopic surgery, image quality can be severely degraded by surgical smoke, which not only introduces error for the image processing (used in image guided surgery), but also reduces the visibility of the surgeons. In this paper, we propose to enhance the laparoscopic images by decomposing them into unwanted smoke part and enhanced part using a variational approach. The proposed method relies on the observation that smoke has low contrast and low inter-channel differences. A cost function is defined based on this prior knowledge and is solved using an augmented Lagrangian method. The obtained unwanted smoke component is then subtracted from the original degraded image, resulting in the enhanced image. The obtained quantitative scores in terms of FADE, JNBM and RE metrics show that our proposed method performs rather well. Furthermore, the qualitative visual inspection of the results show that it removes smoke effectively from the laparoscopic images. 
### 429.Group Sparsity Residual with Non-Local Samples for Image Denoising [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08412.pdf)
> Inspired by group-based sparse coding, recently proposed group sparsity residual (GSR) scheme has demonstrated superior performance in image processing. However, one challenge in GSR is to estimate the residual by using a proper reference of the group-based sparse coding (GSC), which is desired to be as close to the truth as possible. Previous researches utilized the estimations from other algorithms (i.e., GMM or BM3D), which are either not accurate or too slow. In this paper, we propose to use the Non-Local Samples (NLS) as reference in the GSR regime for image denoising, thus termed GSR-NLS. More specifically, we first obtain a good estimation of the group sparse coefficients by the image nonlocal self-similarity, and then solve the GSR model by an effective iterative shrinkage algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GSR-NLS not only outperforms many state-of-the-art methods, but also delivers the competitive advantage of speed. 
### 430.Buried object detection from B-scan ground penetrating radar data using  Faster-RCNN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08414.pdf)
> In this paper, we adapt the Faster-RCNN framework for the detection of underground buried objects (i.e. hyperbola reflections) in B-scan ground penetrating radar (GPR) images. Due to the lack of real data for training, we propose to incorporate more simulated radargrams generated from different configurations using the gprMax toolbox. Our designed CNN is first pre-trained on the grayscale Cifar-10 database. Then, the Faster-RCNN framework based on the pre-trained CNN is trained and fine-tuned on both real and simulated GPR data. Preliminary detection results show that the proposed technique can provide significant improvements compared to classical computer vision methods and hence becomes quite promising to deal with this kind of specific GPR data even with few training samples. 
### 431.Guided Image Inpainting: Replacing an Image Region by Pulling Content  from Another Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08435.pdf)
> Deep generative models have shown success in automatically synthesizing missing image regions using surrounding context. However, users cannot directly decide what content to synthesize with such approaches. We propose an end-to-end network for image inpainting that uses a different image to guide the synthesis of new content to fill the hole. A key challenge addressed by our approach is synthesizing new content in regions where the guidance image and the context of the original image are inconsistent. We conduct four studies that demonstrate our results yield more realistic image inpainting results over seven baselines. 
### 432.A Comprehensive Analysis of Deep Regression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08450.pdf)
> Deep learning revolutionized data science, and recently, its popularity has grown exponentially, as did the amount of papers employing deep networks. Vision tasks such as human pose estimation did not escape this methodological change. The large number of deep architectures lead to a plethora of methods that are evaluated under different experimental protocols. Moreover, small changes in the architecture of the network, or in the data pre-processing procedure, together with the stochastic nature of the optimization methods, lead to notably different results, making extremely difficult to sift methods that significantly outperform others. Therefore, when proposing regression algorithms, practitioners proceed by trial-and-error. This situation motivated the current study, in which we perform a systematic evaluation and a statistical analysis of the performance of vanilla deep regression -- short for convolutional neural networks with a linear regression top layer --. Up to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive analysis of deep regression techniques. We perform experiments on three vision problems and report confidence intervals for the median performance as well as the statistical significance of the results, if any. Surprisingly, the variability due to different data pre-processing procedures generally eclipses the variability due to modifications in the network architecture. 
### 433.Clustering-driven Deep Embedding with Pairwise Constraints [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08457.pdf)
> Recently, there has been increasing interest to leverage the competence of neural networks to analyze data. In particular, new clustering methods that employ deep embeddings have been presented. In this paper, we depart from centroid-based models and suggest a new framework, called Clustering-driven deep embedding with PAirwise Constraints (CPAC), for non-parametric clustering using a neural network. We present a clustering-driven embedding based on a Siamese network that encourages pairs of data points to output similar representations in the latent space. Our pair-based model allows augmenting the information with labeled pairs to constitute a semi-supervised framework. Our approach is based on analyzing the losses associated with each pair to refine the set of constraints. We show that clustering performance increases when using this scheme, even with a limited amount of user queries. We demonstrate how our architecture is adapted for various types of data and present the first deep framework to cluster 3D shapes. 
### 434.Towards Universal Representation for Unseen Action Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08460.pdf)
> Unseen Action Recognition (UAR) aims to recognise novel action categories without training examples. While previous methods focus on inner-dataset seen/unseen splits, this paper proposes a pipeline using a large-scale training source to achieve a Universal Representation (UR) that can generalise to a more realistic Cross-Dataset UAR (CD-UAR) scenario. We first address UAR as a Generalised Multiple-Instance Learning (GMIL) problem and discover 'building-blocks' from the large-scale ActivityNet dataset using distribution kernels. Essential visual and semantic components are preserved in a shared space to achieve the UR that can efficiently generalise to new datasets. Predicted UR exemplars can be improved by a simple semantic adaptation, and then an unseen action can be directly recognised using UR during the test. Without further training, extensive experiments manifest significant improvements over the UCF101 and HMDB51 benchmarks. 
### 435.Branched Generative Adversarial Networks for Multi-Scale Image Manifold  Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08467.pdf)
> We introduce BranchGAN, a novel training method that enables unconditioned generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn image manifolds at multiple scales. What is unique about BranchGAN is that it is trained in multiple branches, progressively covering both the breadth and depth of the network, as resolutions of the training images increase to reveal finer-scale features. Specifically, each noise vector, as input to the generator network, is explicitly split into several sub-vectors, each corresponding to and trained to learn image representations at a particular scale. During training, we progressively "de-freeze" the sub-vectors, one at a time, as a new set of higher-resolution images is employed for training and more network layers are added. A consequence of such an explicit sub-vector designation is that we can directly manipulate and even combine latent (sub-vector) codes that are associated with specific feature scales. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our training method in multi-scale, disentangled learning of image manifolds and synthesis, without any extra labels and without compromising quality of the synthesized high-resolution images. We further demonstrate two new applications enabled by BranchGAN. 
### 436.KonIQ-10k: Towards an ecologically valid and large-scale IQA database [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08489.pdf)
> The main challenge in applying state-of-the-art deep learning methods to predict image quality in-the-wild is the relatively small size of existing quality scored datasets. The reason for the lack of larger datasets is the massive resources required in generating diverse and publishable content. We present a new systematic and scalable approach to create large-scale, authentic and diverse image datasets for Image Quality Assessment (IQA). We show how we built an IQA database, KonIQ-10k, consisting of 10,073 images, on which we performed very large scale crowdsourcing experiments in order to obtain reliable quality ratings from 1,467 crowd workers (1.2 million ratings). We argue for its ecological validity by analyzing the diversity of the dataset, by comparing it to state-of-the-art IQA databases, and by checking the reliability of our user studies. 
### 437.Group Normalization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08494.pdf)
> Batch Normalization (BN) is a milestone technique in the development of deep learning, enabling various networks to train. However, normalizing along the batch dimension introduces problems --- BN's error increases rapidly when the batch size becomes smaller, caused by inaccurate batch statistics estimation. This limits BN's usage for training larger models and transferring features to computer vision tasks including detection, segmentation, and video, which require small batches constrained by memory consumption. In this paper, we present Group Normalization (GN) as a simple alternative to BN. GN divides the channels into groups and computes within each group the mean and variance for normalization. GN's computation is independent of batch sizes, and its accuracy is stable in a wide range of batch sizes. On ResNet-50 trained in ImageNet, GN has 10.6% lower error than its BN counterpart when using a batch size of 2; when using typical batch sizes, GN is comparably good with BN and outperforms other normalization variants. Moreover, GN can be naturally transferred from pre-training to fine-tuning. GN can outperform its BN-based counterparts for object detection and segmentation in COCO, and for video classification in Kinetics, showing that GN can effectively replace the powerful BN in a variety of tasks. GN can be easily implemented by a few lines of code in modern libraries. 
### 438.Text2Shape: Generating Shapes from Natural Language by Learning Joint  Embeddings [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08495.pdf)
> We present a method for generating colored 3D shapes from natural language. To this end, we first learn joint embeddings of freeform text descriptions and colored 3D shapes. Our model combines and extends learning by association and metric learning approaches to learn implicit cross-modal connections, and produces a joint representation that captures the many-to-many relations between language and physical properties of 3D shapes such as color and shape. To evaluate our approach, we collect a large dataset of natural language descriptions for physical 3D objects in the ShapeNet dataset. With this learned joint embedding we demonstrate text-to-shape retrieval that outperforms baseline approaches. Using our embeddings with a novel conditional Wasserstein GAN framework, we generate colored 3D shapes from text. Our method is the first to connect natural language text with realistic 3D objects exhibiting rich variations in color, texture, and shape detail.

### 439.Generalized Scene Reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08496.pdf)
> A new passive approach called Generalized Scene Reconstruction (GSR) enables "generalized scenes" to be effectively reconstructed. Generalized scenes are defined to be "boundless" spaces that include non-Lambertian, partially transmissive, textureless and finely-structured matter. A new data structure called a plenoptic octree is introduced to enable efficient (database-like) light and matter field reconstruction in devices such as mobile phones, augmented reality (AR) glasses and drones. To satisfy threshold requirements for GSR accuracy, scenes are represented as systems of partially polarized light, radiometrically interacting with matter. To demonstrate GSR, a prototype imaging polarimeter is used to reconstruct (in generalized light fields) highly reflective, hail-damaged automobile body panels. Follow-on GSR experiments are described. 
### 440.Aligning Across Large Gaps in Time [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08542.pdf)
> We present a method of temporally-invariant image registration for outdoor scenes, with invariance across time of day, across seasonal variations, and across decade-long periods, for low- and high-texture scenes. Our method can be useful for applications in remote sensing, GPS-denied UAV localization, 3D reconstruction, and many others. Our method leverages a recently proposed approach to image registration, where fully-convolutional neural networks are used to create feature maps which can be registered using the Inverse-Composition Lucas-Kanade algorithm (ICLK). We show that invariance that is learned from satellite imagery can be transferable to time-lapse data captured by webcams mounted on buildings near ground-level. 
### 441.Automated Detection of Acute Leukemia using K-mean Clustering Algorithm [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08544.pdf)
> Leukemia is a hematologic cancer which develops in blood tissue and triggers rapid production of immature and abnormal shaped white blood cells. Based on statistics it is found that the leukemia is one of the leading causes of death in men and women alike. Microscopic examination of blood sample or bone marrow smear is the most effective technique for diagnosis of leukemia. Pathologists analyze microscopic samples to make diagnostic assessments on the basis of characteristic cell features. Recently, computerized methods for cancer detection have been explored towards minimizing human intervention and providing accurate clinical information. This paper presents an algorithm for automated image based acute leukemia detection systems. The method implemented uses basic enhancement, morphology, filtering and segmenting technique to extract region of interest using k-means clustering algorithm. The proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.8% and is tested with Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Naive Bayes Classifier on the data-set of 60 samples. 
### 442.Weighted Bilinear Coding over Salient Body Parts for Person  Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08580.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated dominant performance in person re-identification (Re-ID). Existing CNN based methods utilize global average pooling (GAP) to aggregate intermediate convolutional features for Re-ID. However, this strategy only considers the first-order statistics of local features and treats local features at different locations equally important, leading to sub-optimal feature representation. To deal with these issues, we propose a novel \emph{weighted bilinear coding} (WBC) model for local feature aggregation in CNN networks to pursue more representative and discriminative feature representations. In specific, bilinear coding is used to encode the channel-wise feature correlations to capture richer feature interactions. Meanwhile, a weighting scheme is applied on the bilinear coding to adaptively adjust the weights of local features at different locations based on their importance in recognition, further improving the discriminability of feature aggregation. To handle the spatial misalignment issue, we use a salient part net to derive salient body parts, and apply the WBC model on each part. The final representation, formed by concatenating the WBC eoncoded features of each part, is both discriminative and resistant to spatial misalignment. Experiments on three benchmarks including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 evidence the favorable performance of our method against other state-of-the-art methods. 
### 443.Maximum Consensus Parameter Estimation by Reweighted $\ell_1$ Methods [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08602.pdf)
> Robust parameter estimation in computer vision is frequently accomplished by solving the maximum consensus (MaxCon) problem. Widely used randomized methods for MaxCon, however, can only produce {random} approximate solutions, while global methods are too slow to exercise on realistic problem sizes. Here we analyse MaxCon as iterative reweighted algorithms on the data residuals. We propose a smooth surrogate function, the minimization of which leads to an extremely simple iteratively reweighted algorithm for MaxCon. We show that our algorithm is very efficient and in many cases, yields the global solution. This makes it an attractive alternative for randomized methods and global optimizers. The convergence analysis of our method and its fundamental differences from the other iteratively reweighted methods are also presented. 
### 444.A Quantization-Friendly Separable Convolution for MobileNets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08607.pdf)
> As deep learning (DL) is being rapidly pushed to edge computing, researchers invented various ways to make inference computation more efficient on mobile/IoT devices, such as network pruning, parameter compression, and etc. Quantization, as one of the key approaches, can effectively offload GPU, and make it possible to deploy DL on fixed-point pipeline. Unfortunately, not all existing networks design are friendly to quantization. For example, the popular lightweight MobileNetV1, while it successfully reduces parameter size and computation latency with separable convolution, our experiment shows its quantized models have large accuracy gap against its float point models. To resolve this, we analyzed the root cause of quantization loss and proposed a quantization-friendly separable convolution architecture. By evaluating the image classification task on ImageNet2012 dataset, our modified MobileNetV1 model can archive 8-bit inference top-1 accuracy in 68.03%, almost closed the gap to the float pipeline. 
### 445.X-ray-transform Invariant Anatomical Landmark Detection for Pelvic  Trauma Surgery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08608.pdf)
> X-ray image guidance enables percutaneous alternatives to complex procedures. Unfortunately, the indirect view onto the anatomy in addition to projective simplification substantially increase the task-load for the surgeon. Additional 3D information such as knowledge of anatomical landmarks can benefit surgical decision making in complicated scenarios. Automatic detection of these landmarks in transmission imaging is challenging since image-domain features characteristic to a certain landmark change substantially depending on the viewing direction. Consequently and to the best of our knowledge, the above problem has not yet been addressed. In this work, we present a method to automatically detect anatomical landmarks in X-ray images independent of the viewing direction. To this end, a sequential prediction framework based on convolutional layers is trained on synthetically generated data of the pelvic anatomy to predict 23 landmarks in single X-ray images. View independence is contingent on training conditions and, here, is achieved on a spherical segment covering (120 x 90) degrees in LAO/RAO and CRAN/CAUD, respectively, centered around AP. On synthetic data, the proposed approach achieves a mean prediction error of 5.6 +- 4.5 mm. We demonstrate that the proposed network is immediately applicable to clinically acquired data of the pelvis. In particular, we show that our intra-operative landmark detection together with pre-operative CT enables X-ray pose estimation which, ultimately, benefits initialization of image-based 2D/3D registration. 
### 446.Closing the Calibration Loop: An Inside-out-tracking Paradigm for  Augmented Reality in Orthopedic Surgery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08610.pdf)
> In percutaneous orthopedic interventions the surgeon attempts to reduce and fixate fractures in bony structures. The complexity of these interventions arises when the surgeon performs the challenging task of navigating surgical tools percutaneously only under the guidance of 2D interventional X-ray imaging. Moreover, the intra-operatively acquired data is only visualized indirectly on external displays. In this work, we propose a flexible Augmented Reality (AR) paradigm using optical see-through head mounted displays. The key technical contribution of this work includes the marker-less and dynamic tracking concept which closes the calibration loop between patient, C-arm and the surgeon. This calibration is enabled using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping of the environment of the operating theater. In return, the proposed solution provides in situ visualization of pre- and intra-operative 3D medical data directly at the surgical site. We demonstrate pre-clinical evaluation of a prototype system, and report errors for calibration and target registration. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed inside-out tracking system in achieving "bull's eye" view for C-arm-guided punctures. This AR solution provides an intuitive visualization of the anatomy and can simplify the hand-eye coordination for the orthopedic surgeon. 
### 447.Hardware based Spatio-Temporal Neural Processing Backend for Imaging  Sensors: Towards a Smart Camera [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08635.pdf)
> In this work we show how we can build a technology platform for cognitive imaging sensors using recent advances in recurrent neural network architectures and training methods inspired from biology. We demonstrate learning and processing tasks specific to imaging sensors, including enhancement of sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) purely through neural filtering beyond the fundamental limits sensor materials, and inferencing and spatio-temporal pattern recognition capabilities of these networks with applications in object detection, motion tracking and prediction. We then show designs of unit hardware cells built using complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and emerging materials technologies for ultra-compact and energy-efficient embedded neural processors for smart cameras. 
### 448.PDNet: Prior-model Guided Depth-enhanced Network for Salient Object  Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08636.pdf)
> Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have shown outstanding performance in many computer vision tasks including salient object detection. However, there still remains two issues needed to be addressed in deep learning based saliency detection. One is the lack of tremendous amount of annotated data to train a network. The other is the lack of robustness for extracting salient objects in images containing complex scenes. In this paper, we present a new architecture$ - $PDNet, a robust prior-model guided depth-enhanced network for RGB-D salient object detection. In contrast to existing works, in which RGB-D values of image pixels are fed directly to a network, the proposed architecture is composed of a master network for processing RGB values, and a sub-network making full use of depth cues and incorporate depth-based features into the master network. To overcome the limited size of the labeled RGB-D dataset for training, we employ a large conventional RGB dataset to pre-train the master network, which proves to contribute largely to the final accuracy. Extensive evaluations over five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 449.Lifting Layers: Analysis and Applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08660.pdf)
> The great advances of learning-based approaches in image processing and computer vision are largely based on deeply nested networks that compose linear transfer functions with suitable non-linearities. Interestingly, the most frequently used non-linearities in imaging applications (variants of the rectified linear unit) are uncommon in low dimensional approximation problems. In this paper we propose a novel non-linear transfer function, called lifting, which is motivated from a related technique in convex optimization. A lifting layer increases the dimensionality of the input, naturally yields a linear spline when combined with a fully connected layer, and therefore closes the gap between low and high dimensional approximation problems. Moreover, applying the lifting operation to the loss layer of the network allows us to handle non-convex and flat (zero-gradient) cost functions. We analyze the proposed lifting theoretically, exemplify interesting properties in synthetic experiments and demonstrate its effectiveness in deep learning approaches to image classification and denoising. 
### 450.Fast, Accurate, and Lightweight Super-Resolution with Cascading Residual  Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08664.pdf)
> In recent years, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to single-image super-resolution tasks. Despite their great performances, deep learning methods cannot be easily applied to real-world applications due to the requirement of heavy computation. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an accurate and lightweight deep network for image super-resolution. In detail, we design an architecture that implements a cascading mechanism upon a residual network. We also present variant models of the proposed cascading residual network to further improve efficiency. Our extensive experiments show that even with much fewer parameters and operations, our models achieve performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods. 
### 451.Pyramid Stereo Matching Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08669.pdf)
> Recent work has shown that depth estimation from a stereo pair of images can be formulated as a supervised learning task to be resolved with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, current architectures rely on patch-based Siamese networks, lacking the means to exploit context information for finding correspondence in illposed regions. To tackle this problem, we propose PSMNet, a pyramid stereo matching network consisting of two main modules: spatial pyramid pooling and 3D CNN. The spatial pyramid pooling module takes advantage of the capacity of global context information by aggregating context in different scales and locations to form a cost volume. The 3D CNN learns to regularize cost volume using stacked multiple hourglass networks in conjunction with intermediate supervision. The proposed approach was evaluated on several benchmark datasets. Our method ranked first in the KITTI 2012 and 2015 leaderboards before March 18, 2018. The codes of PSMNet are available at: <a href="https://github.com/JiaRenChang/PSMNet.">this https URL</a> 
### 452.Object Detection for Comics using Manga109 Annotations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08670.pdf)
> With the growth of digitized comics, image understanding techniques are becoming important. In this paper, we focus on object detection, which is a fundamental task of image understanding. Although convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based methods archived good performance in object detection for naturalistic images, there are two problems in applying these methods to the comic object detection task. First, there is no large-scale annotated comics dataset. The CNN-based methods require large-scale annotations for training. Secondly, the objects in comics are highly overlapped compared to naturalistic images. This overlap causes the assignment problem in the existing CNN-based methods. To solve these problems, we proposed a new annotation dataset and a new CNN model. We annotated an existing image dataset of comics and created the largest annotation dataset, named Manga109-annotations. For the assignment problem, we proposed a new CNN-based detector, SSD300-fork. We compared SSD300-fork with other detection methods using Manga109-annotations and confirmed that our model outperformed them based on the mAP score. 
### 453.Revisiting Single Image Depth Estimation: Toward Higher Resolution Maps  with Accurate Object Boundaries [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08673.pdf)
> We revisit the problem of estimating depth of a scene from its single RGB image. Despite the recent success of deep learning based methods, we show that there is still room for improvement in two aspects by training a deep network consisting of two sub-networks; a base network for providing an initial depth estimate, and a refinement network for refining it. First, spatial resolution of the estimated depth maps can be improved using skip connections among the sub-networks which are trained in a sequential fashion. Second, we can improve estimation accuracy of boundaries of objects in scenes by employing the proposed loss functions using depth gradients. Experimental results show that the proposed network and methods improve depth estimation performance of baseline networks, particularly for reconstruction of small objects and refinement of distortion of edges, and outperform the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. 
### 454.Learning Spatial-Temporal Regularized Correlation Filters for Visual  Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08679.pdf)
> Discriminative Correlation Filters (DCF) are efficient in visual tracking but suffer from unwanted boundary effects. Spatially Regularized DCF (SRDCF) has been suggested to resolve this issue by enforcing spatial penalty on DCF coefficients, which, inevitably, improves the tracking performance at the price of increasing complexity. To tackle online updating, SRDCF formulates its model on multiple training images, further adding difficulties in improving efficiency. In this work, by introducing temporal regularization to SRDCF with single sample, we present our spatial-temporal regularized correlation filters (STRCF). Motivated by online Passive-Agressive (PA) algorithm, we introduce the temporal regularization to SRDCF with single sample, thus resulting in our spatial-temporal regularized correlation filters (STRCF). The STRCF formulation can not only serve as a reasonable approximation to SRDCF with multiple training samples, but also provide a more robust appearance model than SRDCF in the case of large appearance variations. Besides, it can be efficiently solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). By incorporating both temporal and spatial regularization, our STRCF can handle boundary effects without much loss in efficiency and achieve superior performance over SRDCF in terms of accuracy and speed. Experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets: OTB-2015, Temple-Color, and VOT-2016. Compared with SRDCF, STRCF with hand-crafted features provides a 5 times speedup and achieves a gain of 5.4% and 3.6% AUC score on OTB-2015 and Temple-Color, respectively. Moreover, STRCF combined with CNN features also performs favorably against state-of-the-art CNN-based trackers and achieves an AUC score of 68.3% on OTB-2015. 
### 455.Region-filtering Correlation Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08687.pdf)
> Recently, correlation filters have demonstrated the excellent performance in visual tracking. However, the base training sample region is larger than the object region,including the Interference Region(IR). The IRs in training samples from cyclic shifts of the base training sample severely degrade the quality of a tracking model. In this paper, we propose the novel Region-filtering Correlation Tracking (RFCT) to address this problem. We immediately filter training samples by introducing a spatial map into the standard CF formulation. Compared with existing correlation filter trackers, our proposed tracker has the following advantages: (1) The correlation filter can be learned on a larger search region without the interference of the IR by a spatial map. (2) Due to processing training samples by a spatial map, it is more general way to control background information and target information in training samples. The values of the spatial map are not restricted, then a better spatial map can be explored. (3) The weight proportions of accurate filters are increased to alleviate model corruption. Experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets: OTB-2013 and OTB-2015. Quantitative evaluations on these benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RFCT algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods. 
### 456.Deep learning and its application to medical image segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08691.pdf)
> One of the most common tasks in medical imaging is semantic segmentation. Achieving this segmentation automatically has been an active area of research, but the task has been proven very challenging due to the large variation of anatomy across different patients. However, recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to significantly improve the performance of image recognition and semantic segmentation methods in the field of computer vision. Due to the data driven approaches of hierarchical feature learning in deep learning frameworks, these advances can be translated to medical images without much difficulty. Several variations of deep convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to medical images. Especially fully convolutional architectures have been proven efficient for segmentation of 3D medical images. In this article, we describe how to build a 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) that can process 3D images in order to produce automatic semantic segmentations. The model is trained and evaluated on a clinical computed tomography (CT) dataset and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-organ segmentation. 
### 457.An Incremental Boolean Tensor Factorization approach to model Change  Patterns of Objects in Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08696.pdf)
> Change detection process has recently progressed from a post-classification method to an expert knowledge interpretation process of the time-series data. The technique finds applications mainly in remote sensing images and can be utilized to analyze urbanization and monitor forest regions. In this paper, a framework to perform a knowledge based interpretation of the changes/no changes observed in a spatiotemporal domain using tensor based approaches is presented. An incremental approach to Boolean Tensor Factorization method is proposed in this work, which is adopted to model the change patterns of objects/classes as well as their associated features. The framework is evaluated under different datasets to visualize the performance for the dependency factors. The algorithm is also validated in comparison with the tradition Boolean Tensor Factorization method and the results are substantial. 
### 458.Optimizing the Trade-off between Single-Stage and Two-Stage Object  Detectors using Image Difficulty Prediction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08707.pdf)
> There are mainly two types of state-of-the-art object detectors. On one hand, we have two-stage detectors, such as Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) or Mask R-CNN, that (i) use a Region Proposal Network to generate regions of interests in the first stage and (ii) send the region proposals down the pipeline for object classification and bounding-box regression. Such models reach the highest accuracy rates, but are typically slower. On the other hand, we have single-stage detectors, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Singe Shot MultiBox Detector), that treat object detection as a simple regression problem by taking an input image and learning the class probabilities and bounding box coordinates. Such models reach lower accuracy rates, but are much faster than two-stage object detectors. In this paper, we propose to use an image difficulty predictor to achieve an optimal trade-off between accuracy and speed in object detection. The image difficulty predictor is applied on the test images to split them into easy versus hard images. Once separated, the easy images are sent to the faster single-stage detector, while the hard images are sent to the more accurate two-stage detector. Our experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that using image difficulty compares favorably to a random split of the images. Our method is flexible, in that it allows to choose a desired threshold for splitting the images into easy versus hard. 
### 459.Pose-Driven Deep Models for Person Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08709.pdf)
> Person re-identification (re-id) is the task of recognizing and matching persons at different locations recorded by cameras with non-overlapping views. One of the main challenges of re-id is the large variance in person poses and camera angles since neither of them can be influenced by the re-id system. In this work, an effective approach to integrate coarse camera view information as well as fine-grained pose information into a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for learning discriminative re-id embeddings is introduced. In most recent work pose information is either explicitly modeled within the re-id system or explicitly used for pre-processing, for example by pose-normalizing person images. In contrast, the proposed approach shows that a direct use of camera view as well as the detected body joint locations into a standard CNN can be used to significantly improve the robustness of learned re-id embeddings. On four challenging surveillance and video re-id datasets significant improvements over the current state of the art have been achieved. Furthermore, a novel reordering of the MARS dataset, called X-MARS is introduced to allow cross-validation of models trained for single-image re-id on tracklet data. 
### 460.CSfM: Community-based Structure from Motion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08716.pdf)
> Structure-from-Motion approaches could be broadly divided into two classes: incremental and global. While incremental manner is robust to outliers, it suffers from error accumulation and heavy computation load. The global manner has the advantage of simultaneously estimating all camera poses, but it is usually sensitive to epipolar geometry outliers. In this paper, we propose an adaptive community-based SfM (CSfM) method which takes both robustness and efficiency into consideration. First, the epipolar geometry graph is partitioned into separate communities. Then, the reconstruction problem is solved for each community in parallel. Finally, the reconstruction results are merged by a novel global similarity averaging method, which solves three convex $L1$ optimization problems. Experimental results show that our method performs better than many of the state-of-the-art global SfM approaches in terms of computational efficiency, while achieves similar or better reconstruction accuracy and robustness than many of the state-of-the-art incremental SfM approaches. 
### 461.A Deep Error Correction Network for Compressed Sensing MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08763.pdf)
> Compressed sensing for magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) exploits image sparsity properties to reconstruct MRI from very few Fourier k-space measurements. The goal is to minimize any structural errors in the reconstruction that could have a negative impact on its diagnostic quality. To this end, we propose a deep error correction network (DECN) for CS-MRI. The DECN model consists of three parts, which we refer to as modules: a guide, or template, module, an error correction module, and a data fidelity module. Existing CS-MRI algorithms can serve as the template module for guiding the reconstruction. Using this template as a guide, the error correction module learns a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map the k-space data in a way that adjusts for the reconstruction error of the template image. Our experimental results show the proposed DECN CS-MRI reconstruction framework can considerably improve upon existing inversion algorithms by supplementing with an error-correcting CNN. 
### 462.Learning Deep Context-Network Architectures for Image Annotation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08794.pdf)
> Context plays an important role in visual pattern recognition as it provides complementary clues for different learning tasks including image classification and annotation. In the particular scenario of kernel learning, the general recipe of context-based kernel design consists in learning positive semi-definite similarity functions that return high values not only when data share similar content but also similar context. However, in spite of having a positive impact on performance, the use of context in these kernel design methods has not been fully explored; indeed, context has been handcrafted instead of being learned. In this paper, we introduce a novel context-aware kernel design framework based on deep learning. Our method discriminatively learns spatial geometric context as the weights of a deep network (DN). The architecture of this network is fully determined by the solution of an objective function that mixes content, context and regularization, while the parameters of this network determine the most relevant (discriminant) parts of the learned context. We apply this context and kernel learning framework to image classification using the challenging ImageCLEF Photo Annotation benchmark; the latter shows that our deep context learning provides highly effective kernels for image classification as corroborated through extensive experiments. 
### 463.Geometric and Physical Constraints for Head Plane Crowd Density  Estimation in Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08805.pdf)
> State-of-the-art methods of people counting in crowded scenes rely on deep networks to estimate people density in the image plane. Perspective distortion effects are handled implicitly by either learning scale-invariant features or estimating density in patches of different sizes, neither of which accounts for the fact that scale changes must be consistent over the whole scene. In this paper, we show that feeding an explicit model of the scale changes to the network considerably increases performance. An added benefit is that it lets us reason in terms of number of people per square meter on the ground, allowing us to enforce physically-inspired temporal consistency constraints that do not have to be learned. This yields an algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art methods on crowded scenes, especially when perspective effects are strong. 
### 464.What Do We Understand About Convolutional Networks? [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08834.pdf)
> This document will review the most prominent proposals using multilayer convolutional architectures. Importantly, the various components of a typical convolutional network will be discussed through a review of different approaches that base their design decisions on biological findings and/or sound theoretical bases. In addition, the different attempts at understanding ConvNets via visualizations and empirical studies will be reviewed. The ultimate goal is to shed light on the role of each layer of processing involved in a ConvNet architecture, distill what we currently understand about ConvNets and highlight critical open problems. 
### 465.Effective deep learning training for single-image super-resolution in  endomicroscopy exploiting video-registration-based reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08840.pdf)
> Purpose: Probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (pCLE) is a recent imaging modality that allows performing in vivo optical biopsies. The design of pCLE hardware, and its reliance on an optical fibre bundle, fundamentally limits the image quality with a few tens of thousands fibres, each acting as the equivalent of a single-pixel detector, assembled into a single fibre bundle. Video-registration techniques can be used to estimate high-resolution (HR) images by exploiting the temporal information contained in a sequence of low-resolution (LR) images. However, the alignment of LR frames, required for the fusion, is computationally demanding and prone to artefacts. Methods: In this work, we propose a novel synthetic data generation approach to train exemplar-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). HR pCLE images with enhanced quality are recovered by the models trained on pairs of estimated HR images (generated by the video-registration algorithm) and realistic synthetic LR images. Performance of three different state-of-the-art DNNs techniques were analysed on a Smart Atlas database of 8806 images from 238 pCLE video sequences. The results were validated through an extensive Image Quality Assessment (IQA) that takes into account different quality scores, including a Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Results: Results indicate that the proposed solution produces an effective improvement in the quality of the obtained reconstructed image. Conclusion: The proposed training strategy and associated DNNs allows us to perform convincing super-resolution of pCLE images. 
### 466.Audio-Visual Event Localization in Unconstrained Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08842.pdf)
> In this paper, we introduce a novel problem of audio-visual event localization in unconstrained videos. We define an audio-visual event as an event that is both visible and audible in a video segment. We collect an Audio-Visual Event(AVE) dataset to systemically investigate three temporal localization tasks: supervised and weakly-supervised audio-visual event localization, and cross-modality localization. We develop an audio-guided visual attention mechanism to explore audio-visual correlations, propose a dual multimodal residual network (DMRN) to fuse information over the two modalities, and introduce an audio-visual distance learning network to handle the cross-modality localization. Our experiments support the following findings: joint modeling of auditory and visual modalities outperforms independent modeling, the learned attention can capture semantics of sounding objects, temporal alignment is important for audio-visual fusion, the proposed DMRN is effective in fusing audio-visual features, and strong correlations between the two modalities enable cross-modality localization. 
### 467.Dist-GAN: An Improved GAN using Distance Constraints [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08887.pdf)
> We introduce effective training algorithms for Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to alleviate mode collapse and gradient vanishing. In our system, we constrain the generator by an Autoencoder (AE). We propose a formulation to consider the reconstructed samples from AE as "real" samples for the discriminator. This couples the convergence of the AE with that of the discriminator, effectively slowing down the convergence of discriminator and reducing gradient vanishing. Importantly, we propose two novel distance constraints to improve the generator. First, we propose a latent-data distance constraint to enforce compatibility between the latent sample distances and the corresponding data sample distances. We use this constraint to explicitly prevent the generator from mode collapse. Second, we propose a discriminator-score distance constraint to align the distribution of the generated samples with that of the real samples through the discriminator score. We use this constraint to guide the generator to synthesize samples that resemble the real ones. Our proposed GAN using these distance constraints, namely Dist-GAN, can achieve better results than state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets: synthetic, MNIST, MNIST-1K, CelebA, CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets. Our code is published here (<a href="https://github.com/tntrung/gan">this https URL</a>) for research. 
### 468.Explicit Reasoning over End-to-End Neural Architectures for Visual  Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08896.pdf)
> Many vision and language tasks require commonsense reasoning beyond data-driven image and natural language processing. Here we adopt Visual Question Answering (VQA) as an example task, where a system is expected to answer a question in natural language about an image. Current state-of-the-art systems attempted to solve the task using deep neural architectures and achieved promising performance. However, the resulting systems are generally opaque and they struggle in understanding questions for which extra knowledge is required. In this paper, we present an explicit reasoning layer on top of a set of penultimate neural network based systems. The reasoning layer enables reasoning and answering questions where additional knowledge is required, and at the same time provides an interpretable interface to the end users. Specifically, the reasoning layer adopts a Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) based engine to reason over a basket of inputs: visual relations, the semantic parse of the question, and background ontological knowledge from word2vec and ConceptNet. Experimental analysis of the answers and the key evidential predicates generated on the VQA dataset validate our approach. 
### 469.Context Encoding for Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08904.pdf)
> Recent work has made significant progress in improving spatial resolution for pixelwise labeling with Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) framework by employing Dilated/Atrous convolution, utilizing multi-scale features and refining boundaries. In this paper, we explore the impact of global contextual information in semantic segmentation by introducing the Context Encoding Module, which captures the semantic context of scenes and selectively highlights class-dependent featuremaps. The proposed Context Encoding Module significantly improves semantic segmentation results with only marginal extra computation cost over FCN. Our approach has achieved new state-of-the-art results 51.7% mIoU on PASCAL-Context, 85.9% mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012. Our single model achieves a final score of 0.5567 on ADE20K test set, which surpass the winning entry of COCO-Place Challenge in 2017. In addition, we also explore how the Context Encoding Module can improve the feature representation of relatively shallow networks for the image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset. Our 14 layer network has achieved an error rate of 3.45%, which is comparable with state-of-the-art approaches with over 10 times more layers. The source code for the complete system are publicly available. 
### 470.Learning to Reconstruct Texture-less Deformable Surfaces from a Single  View [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08908.pdf)
> Recent years have seen the development of mature solutions for reconstructing deformable surfaces from a single image, provided that they are relatively well-textured. By contrast, recovering the 3D shape of texture-less surfaces remains an open problem, and essentially relates to Shape-from-Shading. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven approach to this problem. We introduce a general framework that can predict diverse 3D representations, such as meshes, normals, and depth maps. Our experiments show that meshes are ill-suited to handle texture-less 3D reconstruction in our context. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach generalizes well to unseen objects, and that it yields higher-quality reconstructions than a state-of-the-art SfS technique, particularly in terms of normal estimates. Our reconstructions accurately model the fine details of the surfaces, such as the creases of a T-Shirt worn by a person. 
### 471.Image Inpainting using Block-wise Procedural Training with Annealed  Adversarial Counterpart [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08943.pdf)
> Recent advances in deep generative models have shown promising potential in image inpanting, which refers to the task of predicting missing pixel values of an incomplete image using the known context. However, existing methods can be slow or generate unsatisfying results with easily detectable flaws. In addition, there is often perceivable discontinuity near the holes and require further post-processing to blend the results. We present a new approach to address the difficulty of training a very deep generative model to synthesize high-quality photo-realistic inpainting. Our model uses conditional generative adversarial networks (conditional GANs) as the backbone, and we introduce a novel block-wise procedural training scheme to stabilize the training while we increase the network depth. We also propose a new strategy called adversarial loss annealing to reduce the artifacts. We further describe several losses specifically designed for inpainting and show their effectiveness. Extensive experiments and user-study show that our approach outperforms existing methods in several tasks such as inpainting, face completion and image harmonization. Finally, we show our framework can be easily used as a tool for interactive guided inpainting, demonstrating its practical value to solve common real-world challenges. 
### 472.Deep Convolutional Compressed Sensing for LiDAR Depth Completion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08949.pdf)
> In this paper we consider the problem of estimating a dense depth map from a set of sparse LiDAR points. We use techniques from compressed sensing and the recently developed Alternating Direction Neural Networks (ADNNs) to create a deep recurrent auto-encoder for this task. Our architecture internally performs an algorithm for extracting multi-level convolutional sparse codes from the input which are then used to make a prediction. Our results demonstrate that with only two layers and 1800 parameters we are able to out perform all previously published results, including deep networks with orders of magnitude more parameters. 
### 473.Iterative Low-Rank Approximation for CNN Compression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08995.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks contain tens of millions of parameters, making them impossible to work efficiently on embedded devices. We propose iterative approach of applying low-rank approximation to compress deep convolutional neural networks. Since classification and object detection are the most favored tasks for embedded devices, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by compressing AlexNet, VGG-16, YOLOv2 and Tiny YOLO networks. Our results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to non-repetitive ones. We demonstrate higher compression ratio providing less accuracy loss. 
### 474.Pattern Analysis with Layered Self-Organizing Maps [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08996.pdf)
> This paper defines a new learning architecture, Layered Self-Organizing Maps (LSOMs), that uses the SOM and supervised-SOM learning algorithms. The architecture is validated with the MNIST database of hand-written digit images. LSOMs are similar to convolutional neural nets (covnets) in the way they sample data, but different in the way they represent features and learn. LSOMs analyze (or generate) image patches with maps of exemplars determined by the SOM learning algorithm rather than feature maps from filter-banks learned via backprop. <br />LSOMs provide an alternative to features derived from covnets. Multi-layer LSOMs are trained bottom-up, without the use of backprop and therefore may be of interest as a model of the visual cortex. The results show organization at multiple levels. The algorithm appears to be resource efficient in learning, classifying and generating images. Although LSOMs can be used for classification, their validation accuracy for these exploratory runs was well below the state of the art. The goal of this article is to define the architecture and display the structures resulting from its application to the MNIST images. 
### 475.LayoutNet: Reconstructing the 3D Room Layout from a Single RGB Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08999.pdf)
> We propose an algorithm to predict room layout from a single image that generalizes across panoramas and perspective images, cuboid layouts and more general layouts (e.g. L-shape room). Our method operates directly on the panoramic image, rather than decomposing into perspective images as do recent works. Our network architecture is similar to that of RoomNet, but we show improvements due to aligning the image based on vanishing points, predicting multiple layout elements (corners, boundaries, size and translation), and fitting a constrained Manhattan layout to the resulting predictions. Our method compares well in speed and accuracy to other existing work on panoramas, achieves among the best accuracy for perspective images, and can handle both cuboid-shaped and more general Manhattan layouts. 
### 476.Face Recognition with Hybrid Efficient Convolution Algorithms on FPGAs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09004.pdf)
> Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have become a Swiss knife in solving critical artificial intelligence tasks. However, deploying deep CNN models for latency-critical tasks remains to be challenging because of the complex nature of CNNs. Recently, FPGA has become a favorable device to accelerate deep CNNs thanks to its high parallel processing capability and energy efficiency. In this work, we explore different fast convolution algorithms including Winograd and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and find an optimal strategy to apply them together on different types of convolutions. We also propose an optimization scheme to exploit parallelism on novel CNN architectures such as Inception modules in GoogLeNet. We implement a configurable IP-based face recognition acceleration system based on FaceNet using High-Level Synthesis. Our implementation on a Xilinx Ultrascale device achieves 3.75x latency speedup compared to a high-end NVIDIA GPU and surpasses previous FPGA results significantly. 
### 477.Feature Transfer Learning for Deep Face Recognition with Long-Tail Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09014.pdf)
> Real-world face recognition datasets exhibit long-tail characteristics, which results in biased classifiers in conventionally-trained deep neural networks, or insufficient data when long-tail classes are ignored. In this paper, we propose to handle long-tail classes in the training of a face recognition engine by augmenting their feature space under a center-based feature transfer framework. A Gaussian prior is assumed across all the head (regular) classes and the variance from regular classes are transferred to the long-tail class representation. This encourages the long-tail distribution to be closer to the regular distribution, while enriching and balancing the limited training data. Further, an alternating training regimen is proposed to simultaneously achieve less biased decision boundaries and a more discriminative feature representation. We conduct empirical studies that mimic long-tail datasets by limiting the number of samples and the proportion of long-tail classes on the MS-Celeb-1M dataset. We compare our method with baselines not designed to handle long-tail classes and also with state-of-the-art methods on face recognition benchmarks. State-of-the-art results on LFW, IJB-A and MS-Celeb-1M datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature transfer approach and training strategy. Finally, our feature transfer allows smooth visual interpolation, which demonstrates disentanglement to preserve identity of a class while augmenting its feature space with non-identity variations. 
### 478.Realtime Time Synchronized Event-based Stereo [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09025.pdf)
> In this work, we propose a novel event based stereo method which addresses the problem of motion blur for a moving event camera. Our method uses the velocity of the camera and a range of disparities, to synchronize the positions of the events, as if they were captured at a single point in time. We represent these events using a pair of novel time synchronized event disparity volumes, which we show remove motion blur for pixels at the correct disparity in the volume, while further blurring pixels at the wrong disparity. We then apply a novel matching cost over these time synchronized event disparity volumes, which both rewards similarity between the volumes while penalizing blurriness. We show that our method outperforms more expensive, smoothing based event stereo methods, by evaluating on the Multi Vehicle Stereo Event Camera dataset.

> Based on a clear analysis of the latest Windows driver framework WDF, this paper has implemented a driver of the PCIe-SpaceWire interface card device and put forward a discussion about ensuring the stability of PCIe driver. At the same time, Qt and OpenGL are used to design the upper application. Finally, a functional verification of the control software is provided. 
### 480.A Single-shot Camera-Projector Calibration System For Imperfect Planar  Targets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09058.pdf)
> Existing camera-projector calibration methods typically warp feature points from a camera image to a projector image using estimated homographies, and often suffer from errors in camera parameters and noise due to imperfect planarity of the calibration target. In this paper we propose a simple yet robust solution that explicitly deals with these challenges. Following the structured light (SL) camera-project calibration framework, a carefully designed correspondence algorithm is built on top of the De Bruijn patterns. Such correspondence is then used for initial camera-projector calibration. Then, to gain more robustness against noises, especially those from an imperfect planar calibration board, a novel bundle adjustment algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the estimated camera and projector models. Aside from the robustness, our solution requires only one shot of SL pattern for each calibration board pose, which is much more convenient than multi-shot solutions in practice. Data validations are conducted on both synthetic and real datasets, and our method shows clear advantages over existing methods in all experiments. 
### 481.VOS-GAN: Adversarial Learning of Visual-Temporal Dynamics for  Unsupervised Dense Prediction in Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09092.pdf)
> Recent GAN-based video generation approaches model videos as the combination of a time-independent scene component and a time-varying motion component, thus factorizing the generation problem into generating background and foreground separately. One of the main limitations of current approaches is that both factors are learned by mapping one source latent space to videos, which complicates the generation task as a single data point must be informative of both background and foreground content. In this paper we propose a GAN framework for video generation that, instead, employs two latent spaces in order to structure the generative process in a more natural way: 1) a latent space to generate the static visual content of a scene (background), which remains the same for the whole video, and 2) a latent space where motion is encoded as a trajectory between sampled points and whose dynamics are modeled through an RNN encoder (jointly trained with the generator and the discriminator) and then mapped by the generator to visual objects' motion. Additionally, we extend current video discrimination approaches by incorporating in the learning procedure motion estimation and, leveraging the peculiarity of the generation process, unsupervised pixel-wise dense predictions. Extensive performance evaluation showed that our approach is able to a) synthesize more realistic videos than state-of-the-art methods, b) learn effectively both local and global video dynamics, as demonstrated by the results achieved on a video action recognition task over the UCF-101 dataset, and c) accurately perform unsupervised video object segmentation on standard video benchmarks, such as DAVIS, SegTrack and F4K-Fish. 
### 482.Predicting Gaze in Egocentric Video by Learning Task-dependent Attention  Transition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09125.pdf)
> We present a new computational model for gaze prediction in egocentric videos by exploring patterns in temporal shift of gaze fixations (attention transition) that are dependent on egocentric manipulation tasks. Our assumption is that the high-level context of how a task is completed in a certain way has a strong influence on attention transition and should be modeled for gaze prediction in natural dynamic scenes. Specifically, we propose a hybrid model based on deep neural networks which integrates task-dependent attention transition with bottom-up saliency prediction. In particular, the task-dependent attention transition is learned with a recurrent neural network to exploit the temporal context of gaze fixations, e.g. looking at a cup after moving gaze away from a grasped bottle. Experiments on public egocentric activity datasets show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art gaze prediction methods and is able to learn meaningful transition of human attention. 
### 483.Merging and Evolution: Improving Convolutional Neural Networks for  Mobile Applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09127.pdf)
> Compact neural networks are inclined to exploit "sparsely-connected" convolutions such as depthwise convolution and group convolution for employment in mobile applications. Compared with standard "fully-connected" convolutions, these convolutions are more computationally economical. However, "sparsely-connected" convolutions block the inter-group information exchange, which induces severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we present two novel operations named merging and evolution to leverage the inter-group information. Our key idea is encoding the inter-group information with a narrow feature map, then combining the generated features with the original network for better representation. Taking advantage of the proposed operations, we then introduce the Merging-and-Evolution (ME) module, an architectural unit specifically designed for compact networks. Finally, we propose a family of compact neural networks called MENet based on ME modules. Extensive experiments on ILSVRC 2012 dataset and PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset demonstrate that MENet consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art compact networks under different computational budgets. For instance, under the computational budget of 140 MFLOPs, MENet surpasses ShuffleNet by 1% and MobileNet by 1.95% on ILSVRC 2012 top-1 accuracy, while by 2.3% and 4.1% on PASCAL VOC 2007 mAP, respectively. 
### 484.Multi-Level Factorisation Net for Person Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09132.pdf)
> Key to effective person re-identification (Re-ID) is modelling discriminative and view-invariant factors of person appearance at both high and low semantic levels. Recently developed deep Re-ID models either learn a holistic single semantic level feature representation and/or require laborious human annotation of these factors as attributes. We propose Multi-Level Factorisation Net (MLFN), a novel network architecture that factorises the visual appearance of a person into latent discriminative factors at multiple semantic levels without manual annotation. MLFN is composed of multiple stacked blocks. Each block contains multiple factor modules to model latent factors at a specific level, and factor selection modules that dynamically select the factor modules to interpret the content of each input image. The outputs of the factor selection modules also provide a compact latent factor descriptor that is complementary to the conventional deeply learned features. MLFN achieves state-of-the-art results on three Re-ID datasets, as well as compelling results on the general object categorisation CIFAR-100 dataset. 
### 485.Noise generation for compression algorithms [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09165.pdf)
> In various Computer Vision and Signal Processing applications, noise is typically perceived as a drawback of the image capturing system that ought to be removed. We, on the other hand, claim that image noise, just as texture, is important for visual perception and, therefore, critical for lossy compression algorithms that tend to make decompressed images look less realistic by removing small image details. In this paper we propose a physically and biologically inspired technique that learns a noise model at the encoding step of the compression algorithm and then generates the appropriate amount of additive noise at the decoding step. Our method can significantly increase the realism of the decompressed image at the cost of few bytes of additional memory space regardless of the original image size. The implementation of our method is open-sourced and available at <a href="https://github.com/google/pik.">this https URL</a> 
### 486.Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation from Brain MRI via Fully  Convolutional Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09172.pdf)
> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that leads to lesions in the central nervous system. Magnetic resonance (MR) images provide sufficient imaging contrast to visualize and detect lesions, particularly those in the white matter. Quantitative measures based on various features of lesions have been shown to be useful in clinical trials for evaluating therapies. Therefore robust and accurate segmentation of white matter lesions from MR images can provide important information about the disease status and progression. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to segment white matter lesions from multi-contrast MR images. The proposed CNN based method contains two convolutional pathways. The first pathway consists of multiple parallel convolutional filter banks catering to multiple MR modalities. In the second pathway, the outputs of the first one are concatenated and another set of convolutional filters are applied. The output of this last pathway produces a membership function for lesions that may be thresholded to obtain a binary segmentation. The proposed method is evaluated on a dataset of 100 MS patients, as well as the ISBI 2015 challenge data consisting of 14 patients. The comparison is performed against four publicly available MS lesion segmentation methods. Significant improvement in segmentation quality over the competing methods is demonstrated on various metrics, such as Dice and false positive ratio. While evaluating on the ISBI 2015 challenge data, our method produces a score of 90.48, where a score of 90 is considered to be comparable to a human rater. 
### 487.FaceForensics: A Large-scale Video Dataset for Forgery Detection in  Human Faces [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09179.pdf)
> With recent advances in computer vision and graphics, it is now possible to generate videos with extremely realistic synthetic faces, even in real time. Countless applications are possible, some of which raise a legitimate alarm, calling for reliable detectors of fake videos. In fact, distinguishing between original and manipulated video can be a challenge for humans and computers alike, especially when the videos are compressed or have low resolution, as it often happens on social networks. Research on the detection of face manipulations has been seriously hampered by the lack of adequate datasets. To this end, we introduce a novel face manipulation dataset of about half a million edited images (from over 1000 videos). The manipulations have been generated with a state-of-the-art face editing approach. It exceeds all existing video manipulation datasets by at least an order of magnitude. Using our new dataset, we introduce benchmarks for classical image forensic tasks, including classification and segmentation, considering videos compressed at various quality levels. In addition, we introduce a benchmark evaluation for creating indistinguishable forgeries with known ground truth; for instance with generative refinement models. 
### 488.Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: from Simulation Engine to the RealWorld [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09180.pdf)
> Large-scale labeled training datasets have enabled deep neural networks to excel on a wide range of benchmark vision tasks. However, in many applications it is prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to obtain large quantities of labeled data. To cope with limited labeled training data, many have attempted to directly apply models trained on a large-scale labeled source domain to another sparsely labeled target domain. Unfortunately, direct transfer across domains often performs poorly due to domain shift and dataset bias. Domain adaptation is the machine learning paradigm that aims to learn a model from a source domain that can perform well on a different (but related) target domain. In this paper, we summarize and compare the latest unsupervised domain adaptation methods in computer vision applications. We classify the non-deep approaches into sample re-weighting and intermediate subspace transformation categories, while the deep strategy includes discrepancy-based methods, adversarial generative models, adversarial discriminative models and reconstruction-based methods. We also discuss some potential directions. 
### 489.Learning Type-Aware Embeddings for Fashion Compatibility [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09196.pdf)
> Outfits in online fashion data are composed of items of many different types (e.g. top, bottom, shoes) that share some stylistic relationship with one another. A representation for building outfits requires a method that can learn both notions of similarity (for example, when two tops are interchangeable) and compatibility (items of possibly different type that can go together in an outfit). This paper presents an approach to learning an image embedding that respects item type, and jointly learns notions of item similarity and compatibility in an end-to-end model. To evaluate the learned representation, we crawled 68,306 outfits created by users on the Polyvore website. Our approach obtains 3-5% improvement over the state-of-the-art on outfit compatibility prediction and fill-in-the-blank tasks using our dataset, as well as an established smaller dataset, while supporting a variety of useful queries. 
### 490.Unsupervised Depth Estimation, 3D Face Rotation and Replacement [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09202.pdf)
> We present an unsupervised approach for learning to estimate three dimensional (3D) facial structure from a single image while also predicting 3D viewpoint transformations that match a desired pose and facial geometry. We achieve this by inferring the depth of facial keypoints of an input image in an unsupervised manner, without using any form of ground-truth depth information. We show how it is possible to use these depths as intermediate computations within a new backpropable loss to predict the parameters of a 3D affine transformation matrix that maps inferred 3D keypoints of an input face to the corresponding 2D keypoints on a desired target facial geometry or pose. Our resulting approach can therefore be used to infer plausible 3D transformations from one face pose to another, allowing faces to be frontalized, transformed into 3D models or even warped to another pose and facial geometry. Lastly, we identify certain shortcomings with our formulation, and explore adversarial image translation techniques as a post-processing step to re-synthesize complete head shots for faces re-targeted to different poses or identities. 
### 491.Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: A Multi-task Learning-based Method [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09208.pdf)
> This paper presents a novel multi-task learning-based method for unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, the source and target domain classifiers are jointly learned by considering the geometry of target domain and the divergence between the source and target domains based on the concept of multi-task learning. Two novel algorithms are proposed upon the method using Regularized Least Squares and Support Vector Machines respectively. Experiments on both synthetic and real world cross domain recognition tasks have shown that the proposed methods outperform several state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods. 
### 492.Importance Weighted Adversarial Nets for Partial Domain Adaptation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09210.pdf)
> This paper proposes an importance weighted adversarial nets-based method for unsupervised domain adaptation, specific for partial domain adaptation where the target domain has less number of classes compared to the source domain. Previous domain adaptation methods generally assume the identical label spaces, such that reducing the distribution divergence leads to feasible knowledge transfer. However, such an assumption is no longer valid in a more realistic scenario that requires adaptation from a larger and more diverse source domain to a smaller target domain with less number of classes. This paper extends the adversarial nets-based domain adaptation and proposes a novel adversarial nets-based partial domain adaptation method to identify the source samples that are potentially from the outlier classes and, at the same time, reduce the shift of shared classes between domains. 
### 493.Image Recognition Using Scale Recurrent Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09218.pdf)
> Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) has been widely used for image recognition with great success. However, there are a number of limitations of the current CNN based image recognition paradigm. First, the receptive field of CNN is generally fixed, which limits its recognition capacity when the input image is very large. Second, it lacks the computational scalability for dealing with images with different sizes. Third, it is quite different from human visual system for image recognition, which involves both feadforward and recurrent proprocessing. This paper proposes a different paradigm of image recognition, which can take advantages of variable scales of the input images, has more computational scalabilities, and is more similar to image recognition by human visual system. It is based on recurrent neural network (RNN) defined on image scale with an embeded base CNN, which is named Scale Recurrent Neural Network(SRNN). This RNN based approach makes it easier to deal with images with variable sizes, and allows us to borrow existing RNN techniques, such as LSTM and GRU, to further enhance the recognition accuracy. Our experiments show that the recognition accuracy of a base CNN can be significantly boosted using the proposed SRNN models. It also significantly outperforms the scale ensemble method, which integrate the results of performing CNN to the input image at different scales, although the computational overhead of using SRNN is negligible. 
### 494.Detecting Heads using Feature Refine Net and Cascaded Multi-Scale  Architecture [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09256.pdf)
> This paper presents a method that can accurately detect heads especially small heads under the indoor scene. To achieve this, we propose a novel method, Feature Refine Net (FRN), and a cascaded multi-scale architecture. FRN exploits the multi-scale hierarchical features created by deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed channel weighting method enables FRN to make use of features alternatively and effectively. To improve the performance of small head detection, we propose a cascaded multi-scale architecture which has two detectors. One called global detector is responsible for detecting large objects and acquiring the global distribution information. The other called local detector is designed for small objects detection and makes use of the information provided by global detector. Due to the lack of head detection datasets, we have collected and labeled a new large dataset named SCUT-HEAD which includes 4405 images with 111251 heads annotated. Experiments show that our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on SCUT-HEAD. 
### 495.Deep Depth Completion of a Single RGB-D Image [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09326.pdf)
> The goal of our work is to complete the depth channel of an RGB-D image. Commodity-grade depth cameras often fail to sense depth for shiny, bright, transparent, and distant surfaces. To address this problem, we train a deep network that takes an RGB image as input and predicts dense surface normals and occlusion boundaries. Those predictions are then combined with raw depth observations provided by the RGB-D camera to solve for depths for all pixels, including those missing in the original observation. This method was chosen over others (e.g., inpainting depths directly) as the result of extensive experiments with a new depth completion benchmark dataset, where holes are filled in training data through the rendering of surface reconstructions created from multiview RGB-D scans. Experiments with different network inputs, depth representations, loss functions, optimization methods, inpainting methods, and deep depth estimation networks show that our proposed approach provides better depth completions than these alternatives. 
### 496.StarMap for Category-Agnostic Keypoint and Viewpoint Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09331.pdf)
> Semantic keypoints provide concise abstractions for a variety of visual understanding tasks. Existing methods define semantic keypoints separately for each category with a fixed number of semantic labels in fixed indices. As a result, this keypoint representation is in-feasible when objects have a varying number of parts, e.g. chairs with varying number of legs. We propose a category-agnostic keypoint representation, which combines a multi-peak heatmap (StarMap) for all the keypoints and their corresponding features as 3D locations in the canonical viewpoint (CanViewFeature) defined for each instance. Our intuition is that the 3D locations of the keypoints in canonical object views contain rich semantic and compositional information. Using our flexible representation, we demonstrate competitive performance in keypoint detection and localization compared to category-specific state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we show that when augmented with an additional depth channel (DepthMap) to lift the 2D keypoints to 3D, our representation can achieve state-of-the-art results in viewpoint estimation. Finally, we show that our category-agnostic keypoint representation can be generalized to novel categories. 
### 497.DeepVesselNet: Vessel Segmentation, Centerline Prediction, and  Bifurcation Detection in 3-D Angiographic Volumes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09340.pdf)
> We present DeepVesselNet, an architecture tailored to the challenges to be addressed when extracting vessel networks and corresponding features in 3-D angiography using deep learning. We discuss the problems of low execution speed and high memory requirements associated with full 3-D convolutional networks, high class imbalance arising from low percentage (less than 3%) of vessel voxels, and unavailability of accurately annotated training data - and offer solutions that are the building blocks of DeepVesselNet. <br />First, we formulate 2-D orthogonal cross-hair filters which make use of 3-D context information. Second, we introduce a class balancing cross-entropy score with false positive rate correction to handle the high class imbalance and high false positive rate problems associated with existing loss functions. Finally, we generate synthetic dataset using a computational angiogenesis model, capable of generating vascular networks under physiological constraints on local network structure and topology, and use these data for transfer learning. <br />DeepVesselNet is optimized for segmenting vessels, predicting centerlines, and localizing bifurcations. We test the performance on a range of angiographic volumes including clinical Time-of-Flight MRA data of the human brain, as well as synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy scans of the rat brain. Our experiments show that, by replacing 3-D filters with 2-D orthogonal cross-hair filters in our network, speed is improved by 23% while accuracy is maintained. Our class balancing metric is crucial for training the network and pre-training with synthetic data helps in early convergence of the training process. 
### 498.Learning-Based Quality Control for Cardiac MR Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09354.pdf)
> The effectiveness of a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scan depends on the ability of the operator to correctly tune the acquisition parameters to the subject being scanned and on the potential occurrence of imaging artefacts such as cardiac and respiratory motion. In clinical practice, a quality control step is performed by visual assessment of the acquired images: however, this procedure is strongly operator-dependent, cumbersome and sometimes incompatible with the time constraints in clinical settings and large-scale studies. We propose a fast, fully-automated, learning-based quality control pipeline for CMR images, specifically for short-axis image stacks. Our pipeline performs three important quality checks: 1) heart coverage estimation, 2) inter-slice motion detection, 3) image contrast estimation in the cardiac region. The pipeline uses a hybrid decision forest method - integrating both regression and structured classification models - to extract landmarks as well as probabilistic segmentation maps from both long- and short-axis images as a basis to perform the quality checks. The technique was tested on up to 3000 cases from the UK Biobank study and validated against manual annotations and visual inspections performed by expert interpreters. The results show the capability of the proposed pipeline to correctly detect incomplete or corrupted scans, allowing their exclusion from the analysed dataset or the triggering of a new acquisition. 
### 499.A Face Recognition Signature Combining Patch-based Features with Soft  Facial Attributes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09359.pdf)
> This paper focuses on improving face recognition performance with a new signature combining implicit facial features with explicit soft facial attributes. This signature has two components: the existing patch-based features and the soft facial attributes. A deep convolutional neural network adapted from state-of-the-art networks is used to learn the soft facial attributes. Then, a signature matcher is introduced that merges the contributions of both patch-based features and the facial attributes. In this matcher, the matching scores computed from patch-based features and the facial attributes are combined to obtain a final matching score. The matcher is also extended so that different weights are assigned to different facial attributes. The proposed signature and matcher have been evaluated with the UR2D system on the UHDB31 and IJB-A datasets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed signature achieve better performance than using only patch-based features. The Rank-1 accuracy is improved significantly by 4% and 0.37% on the two datasets when compared with the UR2D system. 
### 500.Correcting differences in multi-site neuroimaging data using Generative  Adversarial Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09375.pdf)
> Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain has been used to investigate a wide range of neurological disorders, but data acquisition can be expensive, time-consuming, and inconvenient. Multi-site studies present a valuable opportunity to advance research by pooling data in order to increase sensitivity and statistical power. However images derived from MRI are susceptible to both obvious and non-obvious differences between sites which can introduce bias and subject variance, and so reduce statistical power. To rectify these differences, we propose a data driven approach using a deep learning architecture known as generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs learn to estimate two distributions, and can then be used to transform examples from one distribution into the other distribution. Here we transform T1-weighted brain images collected from two different sites into MR images from the same site. We evaluate whether our model can reduce site-specific differences without loss of information related to gender (male, female) or clinical diagnosis (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, healthy). When trained appropriately, our model is able to normalise imaging sets to a common scanner set with less information loss compared to current approaches. An important advantage is our method can be treated as a black box that does not require any knowledge of the sources of bias but only needs at least two distinct imaging sets. 
### 501.Precision Sugarcane Monitoring Using SVM Classifier [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09413.pdf)
> India is agriculture based economy and sugarcane is one of the major crops produced in northern India. Productivity of sugarcane decreases due to inappropriate soil conditions and infections caused by various types of diseases , timely and accurate disease diagnosis, plays an important role towards optimizing crop yield. This paper presents a system model for monitoring of sugarcane crop, the proposed model continuously monitor parameters (temperature, humidity and moisture) responsible for healthy growth of the crop in addition KNN clustering along with SVM classifier is utilized for infection identification if any through images obtained at regular intervals. The data has been transmitted wirelessly from the site to the control unit. Model achieves an accuracy of 96% on a sample of 200 images, the model was tested at Lolai, near Malhaur, Gomti Nagar Extension. 
### 502.Deep Faster Detection of Faint Edges in Noisy Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09420.pdf)
> Detection of faint edges in noisy images is a challenging problem studied in the last decades. \cite{ofir2016fast} introduced a fast method to detect faint edges in the highest accuracy among all the existing approaches. Their complexity is nearly linear in the image's pixels and their runtime is seconds for a noisy image. By utilizing the U-net architecture \cite{unet}, we show in this paper that their method can be dramatically improved in both aspects of run time and accuracy. By training the network on a dataset of binary images, we develop a method for faint edge detection that works in a linear complexity. Our runtime on a noisy image is milliseconds on a GPU. Even though our method is orders of magnitude faster, we still achieve higher accuracy of detection under many challenging scenarios. 
### 503.Cascaded multi-scale and multi-dimension convolutional neural network  for stereo matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09437.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks(CNN) have been shown to perform better than the conventional stereo algorithms for stereo estimation. Numerous efforts focus on the pixel-wise matching cost computation, which is the important building block for many start-of-the-art algorithms. However, those architectures are limited to small and single scale receptive fields and use traditional methods for cost aggregation or even ignore cost aggregation. Differently we take them both into consideration. Firstly, we propose a new multi-scale matching cost computation sub-network, in which two different sizes of receptive fields are implemented parallelly. In this way, the network can make the best use of both variants and balance the trade-off between the increase of receptive field and the loss of detail. Furthermore, we show that our multi-dimension aggregation sub-network which containing 2D convolution and 3D convolution operations can provide rich context and semantic information for estimating an accurate initial disparity. Finally, experiments on challenging stereo benchmark KITTI demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve competitive results even without any additional post-processing. 
### 504.REST: Real-to-Synthetic Transform for Illumination Invariant Camera  Localization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09448.pdf)
> Accurate camera localization is an essential part of tracking systems. However, localization results are greatly affected by illumination. Including data collected under various lighting conditions can improve the robustness of the localization algorithm to lighting variation. However, this is very tedious and time consuming. By using synthesized images it is possible to easily accumulate a large variety of views under varying illumination and weather conditions. Despite continuously improving processing power and rendering algorithms, synthesized images do not perfectly match real images of the same scene, i.e. there exists a gap between real and synthesized images that also affects the accuracy of camera localization. To reduce the impact of this gap, we introduce "REal-to-Synthetic Transform (REST)." REST is an autoencoder-like network that converts real features to their synthetic counterpart. The converted features can then be matched against the accumulated database for robust camera localization. In our experiments REST improved feature matching accuracy under variable lighting conditions by approximately 30%. Moreover, our system outperforms state of the art CNN-based camera localization methods trained with synthetic images. We believe our method could be used to initialize local tracking and to simplify data accumulation for lighting robust localization. 
### 505.CNN in MRF: Video Object Segmentation via Inference in A CNN-Based  Higher-Order Spatio-Temporal MRF [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09453.pdf)
> This paper addresses the problem of video object segmentation, where the initial object mask is given in the first frame of an input video. We propose a novel spatio-temporal Markov Random Field (MRF) model defined over pixels to handle this problem. Unlike conventional MRF models, the spatial dependencies among pixels in our model are encoded by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, for a given object, the probability of a labeling to a set of spatially neighboring pixels can be predicted by a CNN trained for this specific object. As a result, higher-order, richer dependencies among pixels in the set can be implicitly modeled by the CNN. With temporal dependencies established by optical flow, the resulting MRF model combines both spatial and temporal cues for tackling video object segmentation. However, performing inference in the MRF model is very difficult due to the very high-order dependencies. To this end, we propose a novel CNN-embedded algorithm to perform approximate inference in the MRF. This algorithm proceeds by alternating between a temporal fusion step and a feed-forward CNN step. When initialized with an appearance-based one-shot segmentation CNN, our model outperforms the winning entries of the DAVIS 2017 Challenge, without resorting to model ensembling or any dedicated detectors. 
### 506.Fast and Accurate Single Image Super-Resolution via Information  Distillation Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09454.pdf)
> Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been demonstrated remarkable progress on single image super-resolution. However, as the depth and width of the networks increase, CNN-based super-resolution methods have been faced with the challenges of computational complexity and memory consumption in practice. In order to solve the above questions, we propose a deep but compact convolutional network to directly reconstruct the high resolution image from the original low resolution image. In general, the proposed model consists of three parts, which are feature extraction block, stacked information distillation blocks and reconstruction block respectively. By combining an enhancement unit with a compression unit into a distillation block, the local long and short-path features can be effectively extracted. Specifically, the proposed enhancement unit mixes together two different types of features and the compression unit distills more useful information for the sequential blocks. In addition, the proposed network has the advantage of fast execution due to the comparatively few numbers of filters per layer and the use of group convolution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods, especially in terms of time performance. 
### 507.Regularizing Deep Hashing Networks Using GAN Generated Fake Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09466.pdf)
> Recently, deep-networks-based hashing (deep hashing) has become a leading approach for large-scale image retrieval. It aims to learn a compact bitwise representation for images via deep networks, so that similar images are mapped to nearby hash codes. Since a deep network model usually has a large number of parameters, it may probably be too complicated for the training data we have, leading to model over-fitting. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple two-stage pipeline to learn deep hashing models, by regularizing the deep hashing networks using fake images. The first stage is to generate fake images from the original training set without extra data, via a generative adversarial network (GAN). In the second stage, we propose a deep architec- ture to learn hash functions, in which we use a maximum-entropy based loss to incorporate the newly created fake images by the GAN. We show that this loss acts as a strong regularizer of the deep architecture, by penalizing low-entropy output hash codes. This loss can also be interpreted as a model ensemble by simultaneously training many network models with massive weight sharing but over different training sets. Empirical evaluation results on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method has superior performance gains over state-of-the-art hashing methods. 
### 508.Image Set Classification for Low Resolution Surveillance [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09470.pdf)
> This paper proposes a novel image set classification technique based on the concept of linear regression. Unlike most other approaches, the proposed technique does not involve any training or feature extraction. The gallery image sets are represented as subspaces in a high dimensional space. Class specific gallery subspaces are used to estimate regression models for each image of the test image set. Images of the test set are then projected on the gallery subspaces. Residuals, calculated using the Euclidean distance between the original and the projected test images, are used as the distance metric. Three different strategies are devised to decide on the final class of the test image set. We performed extensive evaluations of the proposed technique under the challenges of low resolution, noise and less gallery data for the tasks of surveillance, video based face recognition and object recognition. Experiments show that the proposed technique achieves a better classification accuracy and a faster execution time under the challenging testing conditions. 
### 509.Semantic See-Through Rendering on Light Fields [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09474.pdf)
> We present a novel semantic light field (LF) refocusing technique that can achieve unprecedented see-through quality. Different from prior art, our semantic see-through (SST) differentiates rays in their semantic meaning and depth. Specifically, we combine deep learning and stereo matching to provide each ray a semantic label. We then design tailored weighting schemes for blending the rays. Although simple, our solution can effectively remove foreground residues when focusing on the background. At the same time, SST maintains smooth transitions in varying focal depths. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and new real indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our technique. 
### 510.Unsupervised Learning and Segmentation of Complex Activities from Video [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09490.pdf)
> This paper presents a new method for unsupervised segmentation of complex activities from video into multiple steps, or sub-activities, without any textual input. We propose an iterative discriminative-generative approach which alternates between discriminatively learning the appearance of sub-activities from the videos' visual features to sub-activity labels and generatively modelling the temporal structure of sub-activities using a Generalized Mallows Model. In addition, we introduce a model for background to account for frames unrelated to the actual activities. Our approach is validated on the challenging Breakfast Actions and Inria Instructional Videos datasets and outperforms both unsupervised and weakly-supervised state of the art. 
### 511.Latency and Throughput Characterization of Convolutional Neural Networks  for Mobile Computer Vision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09492.pdf)
> We study performance characteristics of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for mobile computer vision systems. CNNs have proven to be a powerful and efficient approach to implement such systems. However, the system performance depends largely on the utilization of hardware accelerators, which are able to speed up the execution of the underlying mathematical operations tremendously through massive parallelism. Our contribution is performance characterization of multiple CNN-based models for object recognition and detection with several different hardware platforms and software frameworks, using both local (on-device) and remote (network-side server) computation. The measurements are conducted using real workloads and real processing platforms. On the platform side, we concentrate especially on TensorFlow and TensorRT. Our measurements include embedded processors found on mobile devices and high-performance processors that can be used on the network side of mobile systems. We show that there exists significant latency--throughput trade-offs but the behavior is very complex. We demonstrate and discuss several factors that affect the performance and yield this complex behavior. 
### 512.Long-term Tracking in the Wild: A Benchmark [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09502.pdf)
> We introduce the OxUvA dataset and benchmark for evaluating single-object tracking algorithms. Benchmarks have enabled great strides in the field of object tracking by defining standardized evaluations on large sets of diverse videos. However, these works have focused exclusively on sequences that are just tens of seconds in length and in which the target is always visible. Consequently, most researchers have designed methods tailored to this "short-term" scenario, which is poorly representative of practitioners' needs. Aiming to address this disparity, we compile a long-term, large-scale tracking dataset of sequences with average length greater than two minutes and with frequent target object disappearance. The OxUvA dataset is much larger than the object tracking datasets of recent years: it comprises 366 sequences spanning 14 hours of video. We assess the performance of several algorithms, considering both the ability to locate the target and to determine whether it is present or absent. Our goal is to offer the community a large and diverse benchmark to enable the design and evaluation of tracking methods ready to be used "in the wild".

### 513.On Regularized Losses for Weakly-supervised CNN Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09569.pdf)
> Minimization of regularized losses is a principled approach to weak supervision well-established in deep learning, in general. However, it is largely overlooked in semantic segmentation currently dominated by methods mimicking full supervision via "fake" fully-labeled training masks (proposals) generated from available partial input. To obtain such full masks the typical methods explicitly use standard regularization techniques for "shallow" segmentation, e.g. graph cuts or dense CRFs. In contrast, we integrate such standard regularizers directly into the loss functions over partial input. This approach simplifies weakly-supervised training by avoiding extra MRF/CRF inference steps or layers explicitly generating full masks, while improving both the quality and efficiency of training. This paper proposes and experimentally compares different losses integrating MRF/CRF regularization terms. We juxtapose our regularized losses with earlier proposal-generation methods using explicit regularization steps or layers. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in semantic segmentation with near full-supervision quality. 
### 514.Efficient Image Dataset Classification Difficulty Estimation for  Predicting Deep-Learning Accuracy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09588.pdf)
> In the deep-learning community new algorithms are published at an incredible pace. Therefore, solving an image classification problem for new datasets becomes a challenging task, as it requires to re-evaluate published algorithms and their different configurations in order to find a close to optimal classifier. To facilitate this process, before biasing our decision towards a class of neural networks or running an expensive search over the network space, we propose to estimate the classification difficulty of the dataset. Our method computes a single number that characterizes the dataset difficulty 27x faster than training state-of-the-art networks. The proposed method can be used in combination with network topology and hyper-parameter search optimizers to efficiently drive the search towards promising neural-network configurations. 
### 515.One-Shot Segmentation in Clutter [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09597.pdf)
> We tackle the problem of one-shot segmentation: finding and segmenting a previously unseen object in a cluttered scene based on a single instruction example. We propose a novel dataset, which we call $\textit{cluttered Omniglot}$. Using a baseline architecture combining a Siamese embedding for detection with a U-net for segmentation we show that increasing levels of clutter make the task progressively harder. Using oracle models with access to various amounts of ground-truth information, we evaluate different aspects of the problem and show that in this kind of visual search task, detection and segmentation are two intertwined problems, the solution to each of which helps solving the other. We therefore introduce $\textit{MaskNet}$, an improved model that attends to multiple candidate locations, generates segmentation proposals to mask out background clutter and selects among the segmented objects. Our findings suggest that such image recognition models based on an iterative refinement of object detection and foreground segmentation may provide a way to deal with highly cluttered scenes. 
### 516.Metric Learning with Dynamically Generated Pairwise Constraints for Ear  Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09630.pdf)
> Ear recognition task is known as predicting whether two ear images belong to the same person or not. In this paper, we present a novel metric learning method for ear recognition. This method is formulated as a pairwise constrained optimization problem. In each training cycle, this method selects the nearest similar and dissimilar neighbors of each sample to construct the pairwise constraints, and then solve the optimization problem by the iterated Bregman projections. Experiments are conducted on AMI, USTB II and WPUT databases. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve promising recognition rates in ear recognition, and its training process is much more efficient than the other competing metric learning methods. 
### 517.BAGAN: Data Augmentation with Balancing GAN [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09655.pdf)
> Image classification datasets are often imbalanced, characteristic that negatively affects the accuracy of deep-learning classifiers. In this work we propose balancing GAN (BAGAN) as an augmentation tool to restore balance in imbalanced datasets. This is challenging because the few minority-class images may not be enough to train a GAN. We overcome this issue by including during the adversarial training all available images of majority and minority classes. The generative model learns useful features from majority classes and uses these to generate images for minority classes. We apply class conditioning in the latent space to drive the generation process towards a target class. The generator in the GAN is initialized with the encoder module of an autoencoder that enables us to learn an accurate class-conditioning in the latent space. We compare the proposed methodology with state-of-the-art GANs and demonstrate that BAGAN generates images of superior quality when trained with an imbalanced dataset. 
### 518.A multilayer backpropagation saliency detection algorithm and its  applications [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09659.pdf)
> Saliency detection is an active topic in the multimedia field. Most previous works on saliency detection focus on 2D images. However, these methods are not robust against complex scenes which contain multiple objects or complex backgrounds. Recently, depth information supplies a powerful cue for saliency detection. In this paper, we propose a multilayer backpropagation saliency detection algorithm based on depth mining by which we exploit depth cue from three different layers of images. The proposed algorithm shows a good performance and maintains the robustness in complex situations. Experiments' results show that the proposed framework is superior to other existing saliency approaches. Besides, we give two innovative applications by this algorithm, such as scene reconstruction from multiple images and small target object detection in video. 
### 519.On the Intrinsic Dimensionality of Face Representation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09672.pdf)
> The two underlying factors that determine the efficacy of face representations are, the embedding function to represent a face image and the dimensionality of the representation, e.g. the number of features. While the design of the embedding function has been well studied, relatively little is known about the compactness of such representations. For instance, what is the minimal number of degrees of freedom or intrinsic dimensionality of a given face representation? Can we find a mapping from the ambient representation to this minimal intrinsic space that retains it's full utility? This paper addresses both of these questions. Given a face representation, (1) we leverage intrinsic geodesic distances induced by a neighborhood graph to empirically estimate it's intrinsic dimensionality, (2) develop a neural network based non-linear mapping that transforms the ambient representation to the minimal intrinsic space of that dimensionality, and (3) validate the veracity of the mapping through face matching in the intrinsic space. Experiments on benchmark face datasets (LFW, IJB-A, IJB-B, PCSO and CASIA) indicate that, (1) the intrinsic dimensionality of deep neural network representation is significantly lower than the dimensionality of the ambient features. For instance, Facenet's 128-d representation has an intrinsic dimensionality in the range of 9-12, and (2) the neural network based mapping is able to provide face representations of significantly lower dimensionality while being as discriminative (TAR @ 0.1% FAR of 84.67%, 90.40% at 10 and 20 dimensions, respectively vs 95.50% at 128 ambient dimension on the LFW dataset) as the corresponding ambient representation. 
### 520.Efficient Interactive Annotation of Segmentation Datasets with  Polygon-RNN++ [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09693.pdf)
> Manually labeling datasets with object masks is extremely time consuming. In this work, we follow the idea of Polygon-RNN to produce polygonal annotations of objects interactively using humans-in-the-loop. We introduce several important improvements to the model: 1) we design a new CNN encoder architecture, 2) show how to effectively train the model with Reinforcement Learning, and 3) significantly increase the output resolution using a Graph Neural Network, allowing the model to accurately annotate high-resolution objects in images. Extensive evaluation on the Cityscapes dataset shows that our model, which we refer to as Polygon-RNN++, significantly outperforms the original model in both automatic (10% absolute and 16% relative improvement in mean IoU) and interactive modes (requiring 50% fewer clicks by annotators). We further analyze the cross-domain scenario in which our model is trained on one dataset, and used out of the box on datasets from varying domains. The results show that Polygon-RNN++ exhibits powerful generalization capabilities, achieving significant improvements over existing pixel-wise methods. Using simple online fine-tuning we further achieve a high reduction in annotation time for new datasets, moving a step closer towards an interactive annotation tool to be used in practice. 
### 521.On the Importance of Stereo for Accurate Depth Estimation: An Efficient  Semi-Supervised Deep Neural Network Approach [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09719.pdf)
> We revisit the problem of visual depth estimation in the context of autonomous vehicles. Despite the progress on monocular depth estimation in recent years, we show that the gap between monocular and stereo depth accuracy remains large$-$a particularly relevant result due to the prevalent reliance upon monocular cameras by vehicles that are expected to be self-driving. We argue that the challenges of removing this gap are significant, owing to fundamental limitations of monocular vision. As a result, we focus our efforts on depth estimation by stereo. We propose a novel semi-supervised learning approach to training a deep stereo neural network, along with a novel architecture containing a machine-learned argmax layer and a custom runtime (that will be shared publicly) that enables a smaller version of our stereo DNN to run on an embedded GPU. Competitive results are shown on the KITTI 2015 stereo dataset. We also evaluate the recent progress of stereo algorithms by measuring the impact upon accuracy of various design criteria. 
### 522.3D Human Pose Estimation in the Wild by Adversarial Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09722.pdf)
> Recently, remarkable advances have been achieved in 3D human pose estimation from monocular images because of the powerful Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). Despite their success on large-scale datasets collected in the constrained lab environment, it is difficult to obtain the 3D pose annotations for in-the-wild images. Therefore, 3D human pose estimation in the wild is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning framework, which distills the 3D human pose structures learned from the fully annotated dataset to in-the-wild images with only 2D pose annotations. Instead of defining hard-coded rules to constrain the pose estimation results, we design a novel multi-source discriminator to distinguish the predicted 3D poses from the ground-truth, which helps to enforce the pose estimator to generate anthropometrically valid poses even with images in the wild. We also observe that a carefully designed information source for the discriminator is essential to boost the performance. Thus, we design a geometric descriptor, which computes the pairwise relative locations and distances between body joints, as a new information source for the discriminator. The efficacy of our adversarial learning framework with the new geometric descriptor has been demonstrated through extensive experiments on widely used public benchmarks. Our approach significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 523.Predicting the Future with Transformational States [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09760.pdf)
> An intelligent observer looks at the world and sees not only what is, but what is moving and what can be moved. In other words, the observer sees how the present state of the world can transform in the future. We propose a model that predicts future images by learning to represent the present state and its transformation given only a sequence of images. To do so, we introduce an architecture with a latent state composed of two components designed to capture (i) the present image state and (ii) the transformation between present and future states, respectively. We couple this latent state with a recurrent neural network (RNN) core that predicts future frames by transforming past states into future states by applying the accumulated state transformation with a learned operator. We describe how this model can be integrated into an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses weighted residual connections to integrate representations of the past with representations of the future. Qualitatively, our approach generates image sequences that are stable and capture realistic motion over multiple predicted frames, without requiring adversarial training. Quantitatively, our method achieves prediction results comparable to state-of-the-art results on standard image prediction benchmarks (Moving MNIST, KTH, and UCF101). 
### 524.Transferable Joint Attribute-Identity Deep Learning for Unsupervised  Person Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09786.pdf)
> Most existing person re-identification (re-id) methods require supervised model learning from a separate large set of pairwise labelled training data for every single camera pair. This significantly limits their scalability and usability in real-world large scale deployments with the need for performing re-id across many camera views. To address this scalability problem, we develop a novel deep learning method for transferring the labelled information of an existing dataset to a new unseen (unlabelled) target domain for person re-id without any supervised learning in the target domain. Specifically, we introduce an Transferable Joint Attribute-Identity Deep Learning (TJ-AIDL) for simultaneously learning an attribute-semantic and identitydiscriminative feature representation space transferrable to any new (unseen) target domain for re-id tasks without the need for collecting new labelled training data from the target domain (i.e. unsupervised learning in the target domain). Extensive comparative evaluations validate the superiority of this new TJ-AIDL model for unsupervised person re-id over a wide range of state-of-the-art methods on four challenging benchmarks including VIPeR, PRID, Market-1501, and DukeMTMC-ReID. 
### 525.Women also Snowboard: Overcoming Bias in Captioning Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09797.pdf)
> Most machine learning methods are known to capture and exploit biases of the training data. While some biases are beneficial for learning, others are harmful. Specifically, image captioning models tend to exaggerate biases present in training data (e.g., if a word is present in 60% of training sentences, it might be predicted in 70% of sentences at test time). This can lead to incorrect captions in domains where unbiased captions are desired, or required, due to over-reliance on the learned prior and image context. In this work we investigate generation of gender-specific caption words (e.g. man, woman) based on the person's appearance or the image context. We introduce a new Equalizer model that ensures equal gender probability when gender evidence is occluded in a scene and confident predictions when gender evidence is present. The resulting model is forced to look at a person rather than use contextual cues to make a gender-specific predictions. The losses that comprise our model, the Appearance Confusion Loss and the Confident Loss, are general, and can be added to any description model in order to mitigate impacts of unwanted bias in a description dataset. Our proposed model has lower error than prior work when describing images with people and mentioning their gender and more closely matches the ground truth ratio of sentences including women to sentences including men. We also show that unlike other approaches, our model is indeed more often looking at people when predicting their gender. 
### 526.Generating Talking Face Landmarks from Speech [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09803.pdf)
> The presence of a corresponding talking face has been shown to significantly improve speech intelligibility in noisy conditions and for hearing impaired population. In this paper, we present a system that can generate landmark points of a talking face from an acoustic speech in real time. The system uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) network and is trained on frontal videos of 27 different speakers with automatically extracted face landmarks. After training, it can produce talking face landmarks from the acoustic speech of unseen speakers and utterances. The training phase contains three key steps. We first transform landmarks of the first video frame to pin the two eye points into two predefined locations and apply the same transformation on all of the following video frames. We then remove the identity information by transforming the landmarks into a mean face shape across the entire training dataset. Finally, we train an LSTM network that takes the first- and second-order temporal differences of the log-mel spectrogram as input to predict face landmarks in each frame. We evaluate our system using the mean-squared error (MSE) loss of landmarks of lips between predicted and ground-truth landmarks as well as their first- and second-order temporal differences. We further evaluate our system by conducting subjective tests, where the subjects try to distinguish the real and fake videos of talking face landmarks. Both tests show promising results. 
### 527.Low-Shot Learning for the Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing  Imagery [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09824.pdf)
> Recent advances in computer vision using deep learning with RGB imagery (e.g., object recognition and detection) have been made possible thanks to the development of large annotated RGB image datasets. In contrast, multispectral image (MSI) and hyperspectral image (HSI) datasets contain far fewer labeled images, in part due to the wide variety of sensors used. These annotations are especially limited for semantic segmentation, or pixel-wise classification, of remote sensing imagery because it is labor intensive to generate image annotations. Low-shot learning algorithms can make effective inferences despite smaller amounts of annotated data. In this paper, we study low-shot learning using self-taught feature learning for semantic segmentation. We introduce 1) an improved self-taught feature learning framework for HSI and MSI data and 2) a semi-supervised classification algorithm. When these are combined, they achieve state-of-the-art performance on remote sensing datasets that have little annotated training data available. These low-shot learning frameworks will reduce the manual image annotation burden and improve semantic segmentation performance for remote sensing imagery. 
### 528.Neural Baby Talk [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09845.pdf)
> We introduce a novel framework for image captioning that can produce natural language explicitly grounded in entities that object detectors find in the image. Our approach reconciles classical slot filling approaches (that are generally better grounded in images) with modern neural captioning approaches (that are generally more natural sounding and accurate). Our approach first generates a sentence `template' with slot locations explicitly tied to specific image regions. These slots are then filled in by visual concepts identified in the regions by object detectors. The entire architecture (sentence template generation and slot filling with object detectors) is end-to-end differentiable. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed model on different image captioning tasks. On standard image captioning and novel object captioning, our model reaches state-of-the-art on both COCO and Flickr30k datasets. We also demonstrate that our model has unique advantages when the train and test distributions of scene compositions -- and hence language priors of associated captions -- are different. Code has been made available at: <a href="https://github.com/jiasenlu/NeuralBabyTalk">this https URL</a> 
### 529.Attributes as Operators: Factorizing Unseen Attribute-Object  Compositions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09851.pdf)
> We present a new approach to modeling visual attributes. Prior work casts attributes in a similar role as objects, learning a latent representation where properties (e.g., sliced) are recognized by classifiers much in the way objects (e.g., apple) are. However, this common approach fails to separate the attributes observed during training from the objects with which they are composed, making it ineffectual when encountering new attribute-object compositions. Instead, we propose to model attributes as operators. Our approach learns a semantic embedding that explicitly factors out attributes from their accompanying objects, and also benefits from novel regularizers expressing attribute operators' effects (e.g., blunt should undo the effects of sharp). Not only does our approach align conceptually with the linguistic role of attributes as modifiers, but it also generalizes to recognize unseen compositions of objects and attributes. We validate our approach on two challenging datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show that not only can our model recognize unseen compositions robustly in an open-world setting, it can also generalize to compositions where objects themselves were unseen during training. 
### 530.WebSeg: Learning Semantic Segmentation from Web Searches [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09859.pdf)
> In this paper, we improve semantic segmentation by automatically learning from Flickr images associated with a particular keyword, without relying on any explicit user annotations, thus substantially alleviating the dependence on accurate annotations when compared to previous weakly supervised methods. <br />To solve such a challenging problem, we leverage several low-level cues (such as saliency, edges, etc.) to help generate a proxy ground truth. Due to the diversity of web-crawled images, we anticipate a large amount of 'label noise' in which other objects might be present. We design an online noise filtering scheme which is able to deal with this label noise, especially in cluttered images. We use this filtering strategy as an auxiliary module to help assist the segmentation network in learning cleaner proxy annotations. Extensive experiments on the popular PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic segmentation benchmark show surprising good results in both our WebSeg (mIoU = 57.0%) and weakly supervised (mIoU = 63.3%) settings. 
### 531.Three Birds One Stone: A Unified Framework for Salient Object  Segmentation, Edge Detection and Skeleton Extraction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09860.pdf)
> In this paper, we aim at solving pixel-wise binary problems, including salient object segmentation, skeleton extraction, and edge detection, by introducing a unified architecture. Previous works have proposed tailored methods for solving each of the three tasks independently. Here, we show that these tasks share some similarities that can be exploited for developing a unified framework. In particular, we introduce a horizontal cascade, each component of which is densely connected to the outputs of previous component. Stringing these components together allows us to effectively exploit features across different levels hierarchically to effectively address the multiple pixel-wise binary regression tasks. To assess the performance of our proposed network on these tasks, we carry out exhaustive evaluations on multiple representative datasets. Although these tasks are inherently very different, we show that our unified approach performs very well on all of them and works far better than current single-purpose state-of-the-art methods. All the code in this paper will be publicly available. 
### 532.Towards Human-Machine Cooperation: Self-supervised Sample Mining for  Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09867.pdf)
> Though quite challenging, leveraging large-scale unlabeled or partially labeled images in a cost-effective way has increasingly attracted interests for its great importance to computer vision. To tackle this problem, many Active Learning (AL) methods have been developed. However, these methods mainly define their sample selection criteria within a single image context, leading to the suboptimal robustness and impractical solution for large-scale object detection. In this paper, aiming to remedy the drawbacks of existing AL methods, we present a principled Self-supervised Sample Mining (SSM) process accounting for the real challenges in object detection. Specifically, our SSM process concentrates on automatically discovering and pseudo-labeling reliable region proposals for enhancing the object detector via the introduced cross image validation, i.e., pasting these proposals into different labeled images to comprehensively measure their values under different image contexts. By resorting to the SSM process, we propose a new AL framework for gradually incorporating unlabeled or partially labeled data into the model learning while minimizing the annotating effort of users. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks clearly demonstrate our proposed framework can achieve the comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods with significantly fewer annotations. 
### 533.Diversity Regularized Spatiotemporal Attention for Video-based Person  Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09882.pdf)
> Video-based person re-identification matches video clips of people across non-overlapping cameras. Most existing methods tackle this problem by encoding each video frame in its entirety and computing an aggregate representation across all frames. In practice, people are often partially occluded, which can corrupt the extracted features. Instead, we propose a new spatiotemporal attention model that automatically discovers a diverse set of distinctive body parts. This allows useful information to be extracted from all frames without succumbing to occlusions and misalignments. The network learns multiple spatial attention models and employs a diversity regularization term to ensure multiple models do not discover the same body part. Features extracted from local image regions are organized by spatial attention model and are combined using temporal attention. As a result, the network learns latent representations of the face, torso and other body parts using the best available image patches from the entire video sequence. Extensive evaluations on three datasets show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by large margins on multiple metrics. 
### 534.Multi-Scale Structure-Aware Network for Human Pose Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09894.pdf)
> We develop a robust multi-scale structure-aware neural network for human pose estimation. This method improves the recent deep conv-deconv hourglass models with four key improvements: (1) multi-scale supervision to strengthen contextual feature learning in matching body keypoints by combining feature heatmaps across scales, (2) multi-scale regression network at the end to globally optimize the structural matching of the multi-scale features, (3) structure-aware loss used in the intermediate supervision and at the regression to improve the matching of keypoints and respective neighbors to infer a higher-order matching configurations, and (4) a keypoint masking training scheme that can effectively fine-tune our network to robustly localize occluded keypoints via adjacent matches. Our method can effectively improve state-of-the-art pose estimation methods that suffer from difficulties in scale varieties, occlusions, and complex multi-person scenarios. This multi-scale supervision tightly integrates with the regression network to effectively (i) localize keypoints using the ensemble of multi-scale features, and (ii) infer global pose configuration by maximizing structural consistencies across multiple keypoints and scales. The keypoint masking training enhances these advantages to focus learning on hard occlusion samples. Our method achieves the leading position in the MPII challenge leaderboard among the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 535.Compassionately Conservative Balanced Cuts for Image Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09903.pdf)
> The Normalized Cut (NCut) objective function, widely used in data clustering and image segmentation, quantifies the cost of graph partitioning in a way that biases clusters or segments that are balanced towards having lower values than unbalanced partitionings. However, this bias is so strong that it avoids any singleton partitions, even when vertices are very weakly connected to the rest of the graph. Motivated by the B\"uhler-Hein family of balanced cut costs, we propose the family of Compassionately Conservative Balanced (CCB) Cut costs, which are indexed by a parameter that can be used to strike a compromise between the desire to avoid too many singleton partitions and the notion that all partitions should be balanced. We show that CCB-Cut minimization can be relaxed into an orthogonally constrained $\ell_{\tau}$-minimization problem that coincides with the problem of computing Piecewise Flat Embeddings (PFE) for one particular index value, and we present an algorithm for solving the relaxed problem by iteratively minimizing a sequence of reweighted Rayleigh quotients (IRRQ). Using images from the BSDS500 database, we show that image segmentation based on CCB-Cut minimization provides better accuracy with respect to ground truth and greater variability in region size than NCut-based image segmentation. 
### 536.A Divide-and-Conquer Approach to Compressed Sensing MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09909.pdf)
> Compressed sensing (CS) theory assures us that we can accurately reconstruct magnetic resonance images using fewer k-space measurements than the Nyquist sampling rate requires. In traditional CS-MRI inversion methods, the fact that the energy within the Fourier measurement domain is distributed non-uniformly is often neglected during reconstruction. As a result, more densely sampled low-frequency information tends to dominate penalization schemes for reconstructing MRI at the expense of high-frequency details. In this paper, we propose a new framework for CS-MRI inversion in which we decompose the observed k-space data into "subspaces" via sets of filters in a lossless way, and reconstruct the images in these various spaces individually using off-the-shelf algorithms. We then fuse the results to obtain the final reconstruction. In this way we are able to focus reconstruction on frequency information within the entire k-space more equally, preserving both high and low frequency details. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in CS-MRI in terms of quantitative performance, and often improves an algorithm's results qualitatively compared with it's direct application to k-space. 
### 537.Diagonalwise Refactorization: An Efficient Training Method for Depthwise  Convolutions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09926.pdf)
> Depthwise convolutions provide significant performance benefits owing to the reduction in both parameters and mult-adds. However, training depthwise convolution layers with GPUs is slow in current deep learning frameworks because their implementations cannot fully utilize the GPU capacity. To address this problem, in this paper we present an efficient method (called diagonalwise refactorization) for accelerating the training of depthwise convolution layers. Our key idea is to rearrange the weight vectors of a depthwise convolution into a large diagonal weight matrix so as to convert the depthwise convolution into one single standard convolution, which is well supported by the cuDNN library that is highly-optimized for GPU computations. We have implemented our training method in five popular deep learning frameworks. Evaluation results show that our proposed method gains $15.4\times$ training speedup on Darknet, $8.4\times$ on Caffe, $5.4\times$ on PyTorch, $3.5\times$ on MXNet, and $1.4\times$ on TensorFlow, compared to their original implementations of depthwise convolutions. 
### 538.Image Semantic Transformation: Faster, Lighter and Stronger [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09932.pdf)
> We propose Image-Semantic-Transformation-Reconstruction-Circle(ISTRC) model, a novel and powerful method using facenet's Euclidean latent space to understand the images. As the name suggests, ISTRC construct the circle, able to perfectly reconstruct images. One powerful Euclidean latent space embedded in ISTRC is FaceNet's last layer with the power of distinguishing and understanding images. Our model will reconstruct the images and manipulate Euclidean latent vectors to achieve semantic transformations and semantic images arthimetic calculations. In this paper, we show that ISTRC performs 10 high-level semantic transformations like "Male and female","add smile","open mouth", "deduct beard or add mustache", "bigger/smaller nose", "make older and younger", "bigger lips", "bigger eyes", "bigger/smaller mouths" and "more attractive". It just takes 3 hours(GTX 1080) to train the models of 10 semantic transformations. 
### 539.Dual Attention Matching Network for Context-Aware Feature Sequence based  Person Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09937.pdf)
> Typical person re-identification (ReID) methods usually describe each pedestrian with a single feature vector and match them in a task-specific metric space. However, the methods based on a single feature vector are not sufficient enough to overcome visual ambiguity, which frequently occurs in real scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable framework, called Dual ATtention Matching network (DuATM), to learn context-aware feature sequences and perform attentive sequence comparison simultaneously. The core component of our DuATM framework is a dual attention mechanism, in which both intra-sequence and inter-sequence attention strategies are used for feature refinement and feature-pair alignment, respectively. Thus, detailed visual cues contained in the intermediate feature sequences can be automatically exploited and properly compared. We train the proposed DuATM network as a siamese network via a triplet loss assisted with a de-correlation loss and a cross-entropy loss. We conduct extensive experiments on both image and video based ReID benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 540.Recent Developments from Attribute Profiles for Remote Sensing Image  Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10036.pdf)
> Morphological attribute profiles (APs) are among the most effective methods to model the spatial and contextual information for the analysis of remote sensing images, especially for classification task. Since their first introduction to this field in early 2010's, many research studies have been contributed not only to exploit and adapt their use to different applications, but also to extend and improve their performance for better dealing with more complex data. In this paper, we revisit and discuss different developments and extensions from APs which have drawn significant attention from researchers in the past few years. These studies are analyzed and gathered based on the concept of multi-stage AP construction. In our experiments, a comparative study on classification results of two remote sensing data is provided in order to show their significant improvements compared to the originally proposed APs. 
### 541.Learning Depth from Single Images with Deep Neural Network Embedding  Focal Length [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10039.pdf)
> Learning depth from a single image, as an important issue in scene understanding, has attracted a lot of attention in the past decade. The accuracy of the depth estimation has been improved from conditional Markov random fields, non-parametric methods, to deep convolutional neural networks most recently. However, there exist inherent ambiguities in recovering 3D from a single 2D image. In this paper, we first prove the ambiguity between the focal length and monocular depth learning, and verify the result using experiments, showing that the focal length has a great influence on accurate depth recovery. In order to learn monocular depth by embedding the focal length, we propose a method to generate synthetic varying-focal-length dataset from fixed-focal-length datasets, and a simple and effective method is implemented to fill the holes in the newly generated images. For the sake of accurate depth recovery, we propose a novel deep neural network to infer depth through effectively fusing the middle-level information on the fixed-focal-length dataset, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods built on pre-trained VGG. Furthermore, the newly generated varying-focal-length dataset is taken as input to the proposed network in both learning and inference phases. Extensive experiments on the fixed- and varying-focal-length datasets demonstrate that the learned monocular depth with embedded focal length is significantly improved compared to that without embedding the focal length information. 
### 542.Tensor graph convolutional neural network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10071.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel tensor graph convolutional neural network (TGCNN) to conduct convolution on factorizable graphs, for which here two types of problems are focused, one is sequential dynamic graphs and the other is cross-attribute graphs. Especially, we propose a graph preserving layer to memorize salient nodes of those factorized subgraphs, i.e. cross graph convolution and graph pooling. For cross graph convolution, a parameterized Kronecker sum operation is proposed to generate a conjunctive adjacency matrix characterizing the relationship between every pair of nodes across two subgraphs. Taking this operation, then general graph convolution may be efficiently performed followed by the composition of small matrices, which thus reduces high memory and computational burden. Encapsuling sequence graphs into a recursive learning, the dynamics of graphs can be efficiently encoded as well as the spatial layout of graphs. To validate the proposed TGCNN, experiments are conducted on skeleton action datasets as well as matrix completion dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that our method can achieve more competitive performance with the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 543.A Framework for Evaluating 6-DOF Object Trackers [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10075.pdf)
> We present a challenging and realistic novel dataset for evaluating 6-DOF object tracking algorithms. Existing datasets show serious limitations---notably, unrealistic synthetic data, or real data with large fiducial markers---preventing the community from obtaining an accurate picture of the state-of-the-art. Using a data acquisition pipeline based on a commercial motion capture system for acquiring accurate ground truth poses of real objects with respect to a Kinect V2 camera, we build a dataset which contains a total of 297 calibrated sequences. They are acquired in three different scenarios to evaluate the performance of trackers: stability, robustness to occlusion and accuracy during challenging interactions between a person and the object. We conduct an extensive study of a deep 6-DOF tracking architecture and determine a set of optimal parameters. We enhance the architecture and the training methodology to train a 6-DOF tracker that can robustly generalize to objects never seen during training, and demonstrate favorable performance compared to previous approaches trained specifically on the objects to track. 
### 544.DeepJDOT: Deep Joint Distribution Optimal Transport for Unsupervised  Domain Adaptation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10081.pdf)
> In computer vision, one is often confronted with problems of domain shifts, which occur when one applies a classifier trained on a source dataset to target data sharing similar characteristics (e.g. same classes), but also different latent data structures (e.g. different acquisition conditions). In such a situation, the model will perform poorly on the new data, since the classifier is specialized to recognize visual cues specific to the source domain. In this work we explore a solution, named DeepJDOT, to tackle this problem: through a measure of discrepancy on joint deep representations/labels based on optimal transport, we not only learn new data representations aligned between the source and target domain, but also simultaneously preserve the discriminative information used by the classifier. We applied DeepJDOT to a series of visual recognition tasks, where it compares favorably against state-of-the-art deep domain adaptation methods. 
### 545.Efficient parametrization of multi-domain deep neural networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10082.pdf)
> A practical limitation of deep neural networks is their high degree of specialization to a single task and visual domain. Recently, inspired by the successes of transfer learning, several authors have proposed to learn instead universal, fixed feature extractors that, used as the first stage of any deep network, work well for several tasks and domains simultaneously. Nevertheless, such universal features are still somewhat inferior to specialized networks. <br />To overcome this limitation, in this paper we propose to consider instead universal parametric families of neural networks, which still contain specialized problem-specific models, but differing only by a small number of parameters. We study different designs for such parametrizations, including series and parallel residual adapters, joint adapter compression, and parameter allocations, and empirically identify the ones that yield the highest compression. We show that, in order to maximize performance, it is necessary to adapt both shallow and deep layers of a deep network, but the required changes are very small. We also show that these universal parametrization are very effective for transfer learning, where they outperform traditional fine-tuning techniques. 
### 546.Point Convolutional Neural Networks by Extension Operators [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10091.pdf)
> This paper presents Point Convolutional Neural Networks (PCNN): a novel framework for applying convolutional neural networks to point clouds. The framework consists of two operators: extension and restriction, mapping point cloud functions to volumetric functions and vise-versa. A point cloud convolution is defined by pull-back of the Euclidean volumetric convolution via an extension-restriction mechanism. <br />The point cloud convolution is computationally efficient, invariant to the order of points in the point cloud, robust to different samplings and varying densities, and translation invariant, that is the same convolution kernel is used at all points. PCNN generalizes image CNNs and allows readily adapting their architectures to the point cloud setting. <br />Evaluation of PCNN on three central point cloud learning benchmarks convincingly outperform competing point cloud learning methods, and the vast majority of methods working with more informative shape representations such as surfaces and/or normals. 
### 547.A New Target-specific Object Proposal Generation Method for Visual  Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10098.pdf)
> Object proposal generation methods have been widely applied to many computer vision tasks. However, existing object proposal generation methods often suffer from the problems of motion blur, low contrast, deformation, etc., when they are applied to video related tasks. In this paper, we propose an effective and highly accurate target-specific object proposal generation (TOPG) method, which takes full advantage of the context information of a video to alleviate these problems. Specifically, we propose to generate target-specific object proposals by integrating the information of two important objectness cues: colors and edges, which are complementary to each other for different challenging environments in the process of generating object proposals. As a result, the recall of the proposed TOPG method is significantly increased. Furthermore, we propose an object proposal ranking strategy to increase the rank accuracy of the generated object proposals. The proposed TOPG method has yielded significant recall gain (about 20%-60% higher) compared with several state-of-the-art object proposal methods on several challenging visual tracking datasets. Then, we apply the proposed TOPG method to the task of visual tracking and propose a TOPG-based tracker (called as TOPGT), where TOPG is used as a sample selection strategy to select a small number of high-quality target candidates from the generated object proposals. Since the object proposals generated by the proposed TOPG cover many hard negative samples and positive samples, these object proposals can not only be used for training an effective classifier, but also be used as target candidates for visual tracking. Experimental results show the superior performance of TOPGT for visual tracking compared with several other state-of-the-art visual trackers (about 3%-11% higher than the winner of the VOT2015 challenge in term of distance precision). 
### 548.Random Polyhedral Scenes: An Image Generator for Active Vision System  Experiments [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10100.pdf)
> We present a Polyhedral Scene Generator system which creates a random scene based on a few user parameters, renders the scene from random view points and creates a dataset containing the renderings and corresponding annotation files. We hope that this generator will enable research on how a program could parse a scene if it had multiple viewpoints to consider. For ambiguous scenes, typically people move their head or change their position to see the scene from different angles as well as seeing how it changes while they move; this research field is called active perception. The random scene generator presented is designed to support research in this field by generating images of scenes with known complexity characteristics and with verifiable properties with respect to the distribution of features across a population. Thus, it is well-suited for research in active perception without the requirement of a live 3D environment and mobile sensing agent, including comparative performance evaluations. The system is publicly available at <a href="https://polyhedral.eecs.yorku.ca.">this https URL</a> 
### 549.A Fast Face Detection Method via Convolutional Neural Network [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10103.pdf)
> Current face or object detection methods via convolutional neural network (such as OverFeat, R-CNN and DenseNet) explicitly extract multi-scale features based on an image pyramid. However, such a strategy increases the computational burden for face detection. In this paper, we propose a fast face detection method based on discriminative complete features (DCFs) extracted by an elaborately designed convolutional neural network, where face detection is directly performed on the complete feature maps. DCFs have shown the ability of scale invariance, which is beneficial for face detection with high speed and promising performance. Therefore, extracting multi-scale features on an image pyramid employed in the conventional methods is not required in the proposed method, which can greatly improve its efficiency for face detection. Experimental results on several popular face detection datasets show the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed method for face detection. 
### 550.Event-based Dynamic Face Detection and Tracking Based on Activity [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10106.pdf)
> We present the first purely event-based approach for face detection using an ATIS, a neuromorphic camera. We look for pairs of blinking eyes by comparing local activity across the input frame to a predefined range, which is defined by the number of events per second in a specific location. If within range, the signal is checked for additional constraints such as duration, synchronicity and distance between the eyes. After a valid blink is registered, we await a second blink in the same spot to initiate Gaussian trackers above the eyes. Based on their position, a bounding box around the estimated outlines of the face is drawn. The face can then be tracked until it is occluded. 
### 551.Learning distributions of shape trajectories from longitudinal datasets:  a hierarchical model on a manifold of diffeomorphisms [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10119.pdf)
> We propose a method to learn a distribution of shape trajectories from longitudinal data, i.e. the collection of individual objects repeatedly observed at multiple time-points. The method allows to compute an average spatiotemporal trajectory of shape changes at the group level, and the individual variations of this trajectory both in terms of geometry and time dynamics. First, we formulate a non-linear mixed-effects statistical model as the combination of a generic statistical model for manifold-valued longitudinal data, a deformation model defining shape trajectories via the action of a finite-dimensional set of diffeomorphisms with a manifold structure, and an efficient numerical scheme to compute parallel transport on this manifold. Second, we introduce a MCMC-SAEM algorithm with a specific approach to shape sampling, an adaptive scheme for proposal variances, and a log-likelihood tempering strategy to estimate our model. Third, we validate our algorithm on 2D simulated data, and then estimate a scenario of alteration of the shape of the hippocampus 3D brain structure during the course of Alzheimer's disease. The method shows for instance that hippocampal atrophy progresses more quickly in female subjects, and occurs earlier in APOE4 mutation carriers. We finally illustrate the potential of our method for classifying pathological trajectories versus normal ageing. 
### 552.End-to-End Learning of Driving Models with Surround-View Cameras and  Route Planners [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10158.pdf)
> For human drivers, having rear and side-view mirrors is vital for safe driving. They deliver a more complete view of what is happening around the car. Human drivers also heavily exploit their mental map for navigation. Nonetheless, several methods have been published that learn driving models with only a front-facing camera and without a route planner. This lack of information renders the self-driving task quite intractable. We investigate the problem in a more realistic setting, which consists of a surround-view camera system with eight cameras, a route planner, and a CAN bus reader. In particular, we develop a sensor setup that provides data for a 360-degree view of the area surrounding the vehicle, the driving route to the destination, and low-level driving maneuvers (e.g. steering angle and speed) by human drivers. With such a sensor setup we collect a new driving dataset, covering diverse driving scenarios and varying weather/illumination conditions. Finally, we learn a novel driving model by integrating information from the surround-view cameras and the route planner. Two route planners are exploited: 1) by representing the planned routes on OpenStreetMap as a stack of GPS coordinates, and 2) by rendering the planned routes on TomTom Go Mobile and recording the progression into a video. Our experiments show that: 1) 360-degree surround-view cameras help avoid failures made with a single front-view camera, in particular for city driving and intersection scenarios; and 2) route planners help the driving task significantly, especially for steering angle prediction. 
### 553.HDM-Net: Monocular Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction with Learned Deformation  Model [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10193.pdf)
> Monocular dense 3D reconstruction of deformable objects is a hard ill-posed problem in computer vision. Current techniques either require dense correspondences and rely on motion and deformation cues, or assume a highly accurate reconstruction (referred to as a template) of at least a single frame given in advance and operate in the manner of non-rigid tracking. Accurate computation of dense point tracks often requires multiple frames and might be computationally expensive. Availability of a template is a very strong prior which restricts system operation to a pre-defined environment and scenarios. In this work, we propose a new hybrid approach for monocular non-rigid reconstruction which we call Hybrid Deformation Model Network (HDM-Net). In our approach, deformation model is learned by a deep neural network, with a combination of domain-specific loss functions. We train the network with multiple states of a non-rigidly deforming structure with a known shape at rest. HDM-Net learns different reconstruction cues including texture-dependent surface deformations, shading and contours. We show generalisability of HDM-Net to states not presented in the training dataset, with unseen textures and under new illumination conditions. Experiments with noisy data and a comparison with other methods demonstrate robustness and accuracy of the proposed approach and suggest possible application scenarios of the new technique in interventional diagnostics and augmented reality. 
### 554.Adaptive Affinity Fields for Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10335.pdf)
> Semantic segmentation has made much progress with increasingly powerful pixel-wise classifiers and incorporating structural priors via Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We propose a simpler alternative that learns to verify the spatial structure of segmentation during training only. Unlike existing approaches that enforce semantic labels on individual pixels and match labels between neighbouring pixels, we propose the concept of Adaptive Affinity Fields (AAF) to capture and match the semantic relations between neighbouring pixels in the label space. We use adversarial learning to select the optimal affinity field size for each semantic category. It is formulated as a minimax problem, optimizing our segmentation neural network in a best worst-case learning scenario. AAF is versatile for representing structures as a collection of pixel-centric relations, easier to train than GAN and more efficient than CRF without run-time inference. Our extensive evaluations on PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and GTA5 datasets demonstrate its above-par segmentation performance and robust generalization across domains. 
### 555.Graph Convolutions on Spectral Embeddings: Learning of Cortical Surface  Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10336.pdf)
> Neuronal cell bodies mostly reside in the cerebral cortex. The study of this thin and highly convoluted surface is essential for understanding how the brain works. The analysis of surface data is, however, challenging due to the high variability of the cortical geometry. This paper presents a novel approach for learning and exploiting surface data directly across surface domains. Current approaches rely on geometrical simplifications, such as spherical inflations, a popular but costly process. For instance, the widely used FreeSurfer takes about 3 hours to parcellate brain surfaces on a standard machine. Direct learning of surface data via graph convolutions would provide a new family of fast algorithms for processing brain surfaces. However, the current limitation of existing state-of-the-art approaches is their inability to compare surface data across different surface domains. Surface bases are indeed incompatible between brain geometries. This paper leverages recent advances in spectral graph matching to transfer surface data across aligned spectral domains. This novel approach enables a direct learning of surface data across compatible surface bases. It exploits spectral filters over intrinsic representations of surface neighborhoods. We illustrate the benefits of this approach with an application to brain parcellation. We validate the algorithm over 101 manually labeled brain surfaces. The results show a significant improvement in labeling accuracy over recent Euclidean approaches, while gaining a drastic speed improvement over conventional methods. 
### 556.Structural inpainting [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10348.pdf)
> Scene-agnostic visual inpainting remains very challenging despite progress in patch-based methods. Recently, Pathak et al. 2016 have introduced convolutional "context encoders" (CEs) for unsupervised feature learning through image completion tasks. With the additional help of adversarial training, CEs turned out to be a promising tool to complete complex structures in real inpainting problems. In the present paper we propose to push further this key ability by relying on perceptual reconstruction losses at training time. We show on a wide variety of visual scenes the merit of the approach for structural inpainting, and confirm it through a user study. Combined with the optimization-based refinement of Yang et al. 2016 with neural patches, our context encoder opens up new opportunities for prior-free visual inpainting. 
### 557.ClickBAIT-v2: Training an Object Detector in Real-Time [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10358.pdf)
> Modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and object detection are often trained offline on large static datasets. Some applications, however, will require training in real-time on live video streams with a human-in-the-loop. We refer to this class of problem as time-ordered online training (ToOT). These problems will require a consideration of not only the quantity of incoming training data, but the human effort required to annotate and use it. We demonstrate and evaluate a system tailored to training an object detector on a live video stream with minimal input from a human operator. We show that we can obtain bounding box annotation from weakly-supervised single-point clicks through interactive segmentation. Furthermore, by exploiting the time-ordered nature of the video stream through object tracking, we can increase the average training benefit of human interactions by 3-4 times. 
### 558.Referring Relationships [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10362.pdf)
> Images are not simply sets of objects: each image represents a web of interconnected relationships. These relationships between entities carry semantic meaning and help a viewer differentiate between instances of an entity. For example, in an image of a soccer match, there may be multiple persons present, but each participates in different relationships: one is kicking the ball, and the other is guarding the goal. In this paper, we formulate the task of utilizing these "referring relationships" to disambiguate between entities of the same category. We introduce an iterative model that localizes the two entities in the referring relationship, conditioned on one another. We formulate the cyclic condition between the entities in a relationship by modelling predicates that connect the entities as shifts in attention from one entity to another. We demonstrate that our model can not only outperform existing approaches on three datasets --- CLEVR, VRD and Visual Genome --- but also that it produces visually meaningful predicate shifts, as an instance of interpretable neural networks. Finally, we show that by modelling predicates as attention shifts, we can even localize entities in the absence of their category, allowing our model to find completely unseen categories. 
### 559.InLoc: Indoor Visual Localization with Dense Matching and View Synthesis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10368.pdf)
> We seek to predict the 6 degree-of-freedom (6DoF) pose of a query photograph with respect to a large indoor 3D map. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we develop a new large-scale visual localization method targeted for indoor environments. The method proceeds along three steps: (i) efficient retrieval of candidate poses that ensures scalability to large-scale environments, (ii) pose estimation using dense matching rather than local features to deal with textureless indoor scenes, and (iii) pose verification by virtual view synthesis to cope with significant changes in viewpoint, scene layout, and occluders. Second, we collect a new dataset with reference 6DoF poses for large-scale indoor localization. Query photographs are captured by mobile phones at a different time than the reference 3D map, thus presenting a realistic indoor localization scenario. Third, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art indoor localization approaches on this new challenging data. 
### 560.Automatic Stroke Lesions Segmentation in Diffusion-Weighted MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10385.pdf)
> Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWI) is widely used for early cerebral infarct detection caused by ischemic stroke. Manual segmentation is done by a radiologist as a common clinical process, nonetheless, challenges of cerebral infarct segmentation come from low resolution and uncertain boundaries. Many segmentation techniques have been proposed and proved by manual segmentation as gold standard. In order to reduce human error in research operation and clinical process, we adopt a semi-automatic segmentation as gold standard using Fluid-Attenuated Inversion-Recovery (FLAIR) Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) from the same patient under controlled environment. Extensive testing is performed on popular segmentation algorithms including Otsu method, Fuzzy C-means, Hill-climbing based segmentation, and Growcut. The selected segmentation techniques have been validated by accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using leave-one-out cross-validation to determine the possibility of each techniques first then maximizes the accuracy from the training set. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of selected methods. 
### 561.Lip Movements Generation at a Glance [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10404.pdf)
> Cross-modality generation is an emerging topic that aims to synthesize data in one modality based on information in a different modality. In this paper, we consider a task of such: given an arbitrary audio speech and one lip image of arbitrary target identity, generate synthesized lip movements of the target identity saying the speech. To perform well in this task, it inevitably requires a model to not only consider the retention of target identity, photo-realistic of synthesized images, consistency and smoothness of lip images in a sequence, but more importantly, learn the correlations between audio speech and lip movements. To solve the collective problems, we explore the best modeling of the audio-visual correlations in building and training a lip-movement generator network. Specifically, we devise a method to fuse audio and image embeddings to generate multiple lip images at once and propose a novel correlation loss to synchronize lip changes and speech changes. Our final model utilizes a combination of four losses for a comprehensive consideration in generating lip movements; it is trained in an end-to-end fashion and is robust to lip shapes, view angles and different facial characteristics. Thoughtful experiments on three datasets ranging from lab-recorded to lips in-the-wild show that our model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods extended to this task. 
### 562.3DMV: Joint 3D-Multi-View Prediction for 3D Semantic Scene Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10409.pdf)
> We present 3DMV, a novel method for 3D semantic scene segmentation of RGB-D scans in indoor environments using a joint 3D-multi-view prediction network. In contrast to existing methods that either use geometry or RGB data as input for this task, we combine both data modalities in a joint, end-to-end network architecture. Rather than simply projecting color data into a volumetric grid and operating solely in 3D -- which would result in insufficient detail -- we first extract feature maps from associated RGB images. These features are then mapped into the volumetric feature grid of a 3D network using a differentiable backprojection layer. Since our target is 3D scanning scenarios with possibly many frames, we use a multi-view pooling approach in order to handle a varying number of RGB input views. This learned combination of RGB and geometric features with our joint 2D-3D architecture achieves significantly better results than existing baselines. For instance, our final result on the ScanNet 3D segmentation benchmark increases from 52.8\% to 75\% accuracy compared to existing volumetric architectures. 
### 563.The HAM10000 Dataset: A Large Collection of Multi-Source Dermatoscopic  Images of Common Pigmented Skin Lesions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10417.pdf)
> Training of neural networks for automated diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions is hampered by the small size and lack of diversity of available datasets of dermatoscopic images. We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations acquired and stored by different modalities. Given this diversity we had to apply different acquisition and cleaning methods and developed semi-automatic workflows utilizing specifically trained neural networks. The final dataset consists of 11788 dermatoscopic images, of which 10010 will be released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and will be publicly available through the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts. Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions. More than 50% of lesions have been confirmed by pathology, the ground truth for the rest of the cases was either follow-up, expert consensus, or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy. 
### 564.The Effects of JPEG and JPEG2000 Compression on Attacks using  Adversarial Examples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10418.pdf)
> Adversarial examples are known to have a negative effect on the performance of classifiers which have otherwise good performance on undisturbed images. These examples are generated by adding non-random noise to the testing samples in order to make classifier misclassify the given data. Adversarial attacks use these intentionally generated examples and they pose a security risk to the machine learning based systems. To be immune to such attacks, it is desirable to have a pre-processing mechanism which removes these effects causing misclassification while keeping the content of the image. JPEG and JPEG2000 are well-known image compression techniques which suppress the high-frequency content taking the human visual system into account. JPEG has been also shown to be an effective method for reducing adversarial noise. In this paper, we propose applying JPEG2000 compression as an alternative and systematically compare the classification performance of adversarial images compressed using JPEG and JPEG2000 at different target PSNR values and maximum compression levels. Our experiments show that JPEG2000 is more effective in reducing adversarial noise as it allows higher compression rates with less distortion and it does not introduce blocking artifacts. 
### 565.Robust Video Content Alignment and Compensation for Rain Removal in a  CNN Framework [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10433.pdf)
> Rain removal is important for improving the robustness of outdoor vision based systems. Current rain removal methods show limitations either for complex dynamic scenes shot from fast moving cameras, or under torrential rain fall with opaque occlusions. We propose a novel derain algorithm, which applies superpixel (SP) segmentation to decompose the scene into depth consistent units. Alignment of scene contents are done at the SP level, which proves to be robust towards rain occlusion and fast camera motion. Two alignment output tensors, i.e., optimal temporal match tensor and sorted spatial-temporal match tensor, provide informative clues for rain streak location and occluded background contents to generate an intermediate derain output. These tensors will be subsequently prepared as input features for a convolutional neural network to restore high frequency details to the intermediate output for compensation of mis-alignment blur. Extensive evaluations show that up to 5 dB reconstruction PSNR advantage is achieved over state-of-the-art methods. Visual inspection shows that much cleaner rain removal is achieved especially for highly dynamic scenes with heavy and opaque rainfall from a fast moving camera. 
### 566.Exploiting Recurrent Neural Networks and Leap Motion Controller for Sign  Language and Semaphoric Gesture Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10435.pdf)
> In human interactions, hands are a powerful way of expressing information that, in some cases, can be used as a valid substitute for voice, as it happens in Sign Language. Hand gesture recognition has always been an interesting topic in the areas of computer vision and multimedia. These gestures can be represented as sets of feature vectors that change over time. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are suited to analyse this type of sets thanks to their ability to model the long term contextual information of temporal sequences. In this paper, a RNN is trained by using as features the angles formed by the finger bones of human hands. The selected features, acquired by a Leap Motion Controller (LMC) sensor, have been chosen because the majority of human gestures produce joint movements that generate truly characteristic corners. A challenging subset composed by a large number of gestures defined by the American Sign Language (ASL) is used to test the proposed solution and the effectiveness of the selected angles. Moreover, the proposed method has been compared to other state of the art works on the SHREC dataset, thus demonstrating its superiority in hand gesture recognition accuracy. 
### 567.Learning Pixel-level Semantic Affinity with Image-level Supervision for  Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10464.pdf)
> The deficiency of segmentation labels is one of the main obstacles to semantic segmentation in the wild. To alleviate this issue, we present a novel framework that generates segmentation labels of images given their image-level class labels. In this weakly supervised setting, trained models have been known to segment local discriminative parts rather than the entire object area. Our solution is to propagate such local responses to nearby areas which belong to the same semantic entity. To this end, we propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN) called AffinityNet that predicts semantic affinity between a pair of adjacent image coordinates. The semantic propagation is then realized by random walk with the affinities predicted by AffinityNet. More importantly, the supervision employed to train AffinityNet is given by the initial discriminative part segmentation, which is incomplete as a segmentation annotation but sufficient for learning semantic affinities within small image areas. Thus the entire framework relies only on image-level class labels and does not require any extra data or annotations. On the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, a DNN learned with segmentation labels generated by our method outperforms previous models trained with the same level of supervision, and is even as competitive as those relying on stronger supervision. 
### 568.Objects Localisation from Motion with Constraints [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10474.pdf)
> This paper presents a method to estimate the 3D object position and occupancy given a set of object detections in multiple images and calibrated cameras. This problem is modelled as the estimation of a set of quadrics given 2D conics fit to the object bounding boxes. Although a closed form solution has been recently proposed, the resulting quadrics can be inaccurate or even be non valid ellipsoids in presence of noisy and inaccurate detections. This effect is especially important in case of small baselines, resulting in dramatic failures. To cope with this problem, we propose a set of linear constraints by matching the centres of the reprojected quadrics with the centres of the observed conics. These constraints can be solved with a linear system thus providing a more computationally efficient solution with respect to a non-linear alternative. Experiments on real data show that the proposed approach improves significantly the accuracy and the validity of the ellipsoids. 
### 569.Context-aware Deep Feature Compression for High-speed Visual Tracking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10537.pdf)
> We propose a new context-aware correlation filter based tracking framework to achieve both high computational speed and state-of-the-art performance among real-time trackers. The major contribution to the high computational speed lies in the proposed deep feature compression that is achieved by a context-aware scheme utilizing multiple expert auto-encoders; a context in our framework refers to the coarse category of the tracking target according to appearance patterns. In the pre-training phase, one expert auto-encoder is trained per category. In the tracking phase, the best expert auto-encoder is selected for a given target, and only this auto-encoder is used. To achieve high tracking performance with the compressed feature map, we introduce extrinsic denoising processes and a new orthogonality loss term for pre-training and fine-tuning of the expert auto-encoders. We validate the proposed context-aware framework through a number of experiments, where our method achieves a comparable performance to state-of-the-art trackers which cannot run in real-time, while running at a significantly fast speed of over 100 fps. 
### 570.FPGA Implementations of 3D-SIMD Processor Architecture for Deep Neural  Networks Using Relative Indexed Compressed Sparse Filter Encoding Format and  Stacked Filters Stationary Flow [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10548.pdf)
> It is a challenging task to deploy computationally and memory intensive State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) on embedded systems with limited hardware resources and power budgets. Recently developed techniques like Deep Compression make it possible to fit large DNNs, such as AlexNet and VGGNet, fully in on-chip SRAM. But sparse networks compressed using existing encoding formats, like CSR or CSC, complex the computation at runtime due to their irregular memory access characteristics. In [1], we introduce a computation dataflow, stacked filters stationary dataflow (SFS), and a corresponding data encoding format, relative indexed compressed sparse filter format (CSF), to make the best of data sparsity, and simplify data handling at execution time. In this paper we present FPGA implementations of these methods. We implement several compact streaming fully connected (FC) and Convolutional (CONV) neural network processors to show their efficiency. Comparing with the state-of-the-art results [2,3,4], our methods achieve at least 2x improvement for computation efficiency per PE on most layers. Especially, our methods achieve 8x improvement on AlexNet layer CONV4 with 384 filters, and 11x improvement on VGG16 layer CONV5-3 with 512 filters. 
### 571.ELEGANT: Exchanging Latent Encodings with GAN for Transferring Multiple  Face Attributes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10562.pdf)
> Recent studies on face attribute transfer have achieved great success. A lot of models are able to transfer face attributes with an input image. However, they suffer from three limitations: (1) incapability of generating image by exemplars; (2) being unable to transfer multiple face attributes simultaneously; (3) low quality of generated images, such as low-resolution or artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model which receives two images of opposite attributes as inputs. Our model can transfer exactly the same type of attributes from one image to another by exchanging certain part of their encodings. All the attributes are encoded in a disentangled manner in the latent space, which enables us to manipulate several attributes simultaneously. Besides, our model learns the residual images so as to facilitate training on higher resolution images. With the help of multi-scale discriminators for adversarial training, it can even generate high-quality images with finer details and less artifacts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on overcoming the above three limitations by comparing with other methods on the CelebA face database. A pytorch implementation is available at <a href="https://github.com/Prinsphield/ELEGANT.">this https URL</a> 
### 572.Image Generation and Translation with Disentangled Representations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10567.pdf)
> Generative models have made significant progress in the tasks of modeling complex data distributions such as natural images. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and auto-encoders lead to the possibility of training on big data sets in an unsupervised manner. However, for many generative models it is not possible to specify what kind of image should be generated and it is not possible to translate existing images into new images of similar domains. Furthermore, models that can perform image-to-image translation often need distinct models for each domain, making it hard to scale these systems to multiple domain image-to-image translation. We introduce a model that can do both, controllable image generation and image-to-image translation between multiple domains. We split our image representation into two parts encoding unstructured and structured information respectively. The latter is designed in a disentangled manner, so that different parts encode different image characteristics. We train an encoder to encode images into these representations and use a small amount of labeled data to specify what kind of information should be encoded in the disentangled part. A generator is trained to generate images from these representations using the characteristics provided by the disentangled part of the representation. Through this we can control what kind of images the generator generates, translate images between different domains, and even learn unknown data-generating factors while only using one single model. 
### 573.Stochastic Variational Inference with Gradient Linearization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10586.pdf)
> Variational inference has experienced a recent surge in popularity owing to stochastic approaches, which have yielded practical tools for a wide range of model classes. A key benefit is that stochastic variational inference obviates the tedious process of deriving analytical expressions for closed-form variable updates. Instead, one simply needs to derive the gradient of the log-posterior, which is often much easier. Yet for certain model classes, the log-posterior itself is difficult to optimize using standard gradient techniques. One such example are random field models, where optimization based on gradient linearization has proven popular, since it speeds up convergence significantly and can avoid poor local optima. In this paper we propose stochastic variational inference with gradient linearization (SVIGL). It is similarly convenient as standard stochastic variational inference - all that is required is a local linearization of the energy gradient. Its benefit over stochastic variational inference with conventional gradient methods is a clear improvement in convergence speed, while yielding comparable or even better variational approximations in terms of KL divergence. We demonstrate the benefits of SVIGL in three applications: Optical flow estimation, Poisson-Gaussian denoising, and 3D surface reconstruction. 
### 574.Video Representation Learning Using Discriminative Pooling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10628.pdf)
> Popular deep models for action recognition in videos generate independent predictions for short clips, which are then pooled heuristically to assign an action label to the full video segment. As not all frames may characterize the underlying action---indeed, many are common across multiple actions---pooling schemes that impose equal importance on all frames might be unfavorable. In an attempt to tackle this problem, we propose discriminative pooling, based on the notion that among the deep features generated on all short clips, there is at least one that characterizes the action. To this end, we learn a (nonlinear) hyperplane that separates this unknown, yet discriminative, feature from the rest. Applying multiple instance learning in a large-margin setup, we use the parameters of this separating hyperplane as a descriptor for the full video segment. Since these parameters are directly related to the support vectors in a max-margin framework, they serve as robust representations for pooling of the features. We formulate a joint objective and an efficient solver that learns these hyperplanes per video and the corresponding action classifiers over the hyperplanes. Our pooling scheme is end-to-end trainable within a deep framework. We report results from experiments on three benchmark datasets spanning a variety of challenges and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across these tasks. 
### 575.Person re-identification with fusion of hand-crafted and deep pose-based  body region features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10630.pdf)
> Person re-identification (re-ID) aims to accurately re- trieve a person from a large-scale database of images cap- tured across multiple cameras. Existing works learn deep representations using a large training subset of unique per- sons. However, identifying unseen persons is critical for a good re-ID algorithm. Moreover, the misalignment be- tween person crops to detection errors or pose variations leads to poor feature matching. In this work, we present a fusion of handcrafted features and deep feature representa- tion learned using multiple body parts to complement the global body features that achieves high performance on un- seen test images. Pose information is used to detect body regions that are passed through Convolutional Neural Net- works (CNN) to guide feature learning. Finally, a metric learning step enables robust distance matching on a dis- criminative subspace. Experimental results on 4 popular re-ID benchmark datasets namely VIPer, DukeMTMC-reID, Market-1501 and CUHK03 show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in image-based per- son re-identification. 
### 576.Motion Guided LIDAR-camera Autocalibration and Accelerated Depth Super  Resolution [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10681.pdf)
> In this work we propose a novel motion guided method for automatic and targetless calibration of a LiDAR and camera and use the LiDAR points projected on the image for real-time super-resolution depth estimation. The calibration parameters are estimated by optimizing a cost function that penalizes the difference in the motion vectors obtained from LiDAR and camera data separately. For super-resolution, we propose a simple, yet effective and time efficient formulation that minimizes depth gradients subject to an equality constraint involving measured LiDAR data. We perform experiments on real data obtained in urban environments and demonstrate that the proposed calibration technique is robust and the real-time depth super-resolution reconstruction outperforms the quality of state of the art approaches. 
### 577.Pose2Seg: Human Instance Segmentation Without Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10683.pdf)
> The general method of image instance segmentation is to perform the object detection first, and then segment the object from the detection bounding-box. More recently, deep learning methods like Mask R-CNN perform them jointly. However, little research takes into account the uniqueness of the "1human" category, which can be well defined by the pose skeleton. In this paper, we present a brand new pose-based instance segmentation framework for humans which separates instances based on human pose, not proposal region detection. We demonstrate that our pose-based framework can achieve similar accuracy to the detection-based approach, and can moreover better handle occlusion, which is the most challenging problem in the detection-based framework. 
### 578.Weakly-Supervised Action Segmentation with Iterative Soft Boundary  Assignment [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10699.pdf)
> In this work, we address the task of weakly-supervised human action segmentation in long, untrimmed videos. Recent methods have relied on expensive learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). However, these methods suffer from expensive computational cost, thus are unable to be deployed in large scale. To overcome the limitations, the keys to our design are efficiency and scalability. We propose a novel action modeling framework, which consists of a new temporal convolutional network, named Temporal Convolutional Feature Pyramid Network (TCFPN), for predicting frame-wise action labels, and a novel training strategy for weakly-supervised sequence modeling, named Iterative Soft Boundary Assignment (ISBA), to align action sequences and update the network in an iterative fashion. The proposed framework is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, Breakfast and Hollywood Extended, with four different evaluation metrics. Extensive experimental results show that our methods achieve competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. 
### 579.End-to-End Multi-Task Learning with Attention [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10704.pdf)
> In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning architecture, which incorporates recent advances in attention mechanisms. Our approach, the Multi-Task Attention Network (MTAN), consists of a single shared network containing a global feature pool, together with task-specific soft-attention modules, which are trainable in an end-to-end manner. These attention modules allow for learning of task-specific features from the global pool, whilst simultaneously allowing for features to be shared across different tasks. The architecture can be built upon any feed-forward neural network, is simple to implement, and is parameter efficient. Experiments on the CityScapes dataset show that our method outperforms several baselines in both single-task and multi-task learning, and is also more robust to the various weighting schemes in the multi-task loss function. We further explore the effectiveness of our method through experiments over a range of task complexities, and show how our method scales well with task complexity compared to baselines. 
### 580.Adversarial Network Compression [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10750.pdf)
> Neural network compression has recently received much attention due to the computational requirements of modern deep models. In this work, our objective is to transfer knowledge from a deep and accurate model to a smaller one. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we propose an adversarial network compression approach to train the small student network to mimic the large teacher, without the need for labels during training; (ii) we introduce a regularization scheme to prevent a trivially-strong discriminator without reducing the network capacity and (iii) our approach generalizes on different teacher-student models. <br />In an extensive evaluation on five standard datasets, we show that our student has small accuracy drop, achieves better performance than other knowledge transfer approaches and it surpasses the performance of the same network trained with labels. In addition, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results compared to other compression strategies. 
### 581.TrackingNet: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Object Tracking in  the Wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10794.pdf)
> Despite the numerous developments in object tracking, further development of current tracking algorithms is limited by small and mostly saturated datasets. As a matter of fact, data-hungry trackers based on deep-learning currently rely on object detection datasets due to the scarcity of dedicated large-scale tracking datasets. In this work, we present TrackingNet, the first large-scale dataset and benchmark for object tracking in the wild. We provide more than 30K videos with more than 14 million dense bounding box annotations. Our dataset covers a wide selection of object classes in broad and diverse context. By releasing such a large-scale dataset, we expect deep trackers to further improve and generalize. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark composed of 500 novel videos, modeled with a distribution similar to our training dataset. By sequestering the annotation of the test set and providing an online evaluation server, we provide a fair benchmark for future development of object trackers. Deep trackers fine-tuned on a fraction of our dataset improve their performance by up to 1.6% on OTB100 and up to 1.7% on TrackingNet Test. We provide an extensive benchmark on TrackingNet by evaluating more than 20 trackers. Our results suggest that object tracking in the wild is far from being solved. 
### 582.Learning to Become an Expert: Deep Networks Applied To Super-Resolution  Microscopy [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10806.pdf)
> With super-resolution optical microscopy, it is now possible to observe molecular interactions in living cells. The obtained images have a very high spatial precision but their overall quality can vary a lot depending on the structure of interest and the imaging parameters. Moreover, evaluating this quality is often difficult for non-expert users. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning the quality function of super- resolution images from scores provided by experts. More specifically, we are proposing a system based on a deep neural network that can provide a quantitative quality measure of a STED image of neuronal structures given as input. We conduct a user study in order to evaluate the quality of the predictions of the neural network against those of a human expert. Results show the potential while highlighting some of the limits of the proposed approach. 
### 583.Who Let The Dogs Out? Modeling Dog Behavior From Visual Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10827.pdf)
> We introduce the task of directly modeling a visually intelligent agent. Computer vision typically focuses on solving various subtasks related to visual intelligence. We depart from this standard approach to computer vision; instead we directly model a visually intelligent agent. Our model takes visual information as input and directly predicts the actions of the agent. Toward this end we introduce DECADE, a large-scale dataset of ego-centric videos from a dog's perspective as well as her corresponding movements. Using this data we model how the dog acts and how the dog plans her movements. We show under a variety of metrics that given just visual input we can successfully model this intelligent agent in many situations. Moreover, the representation learned by our model encodes distinct information compared to representations trained on image classification, and our learned representation can generalize to other domains. In particular, we show strong results on the task of walkable surface estimation by using this dog modeling task as representation learning. 
### 584.Deep Learning Object Detection Methods for Ecological Camera Trap Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10842.pdf)
> Deep learning methods for computer vision tasks show promise for automating the data analysis of camera trap images. Ecological camera traps are a common approach for monitoring an ecosystem's animal population, as they provide continual insight into an environment without being intrusive. However, the analysis of camera trap images is expensive, labour intensive, and time consuming. Recent advances in the field of deep learning for object detection show promise towards automating the analysis of camera trap images. Here, we demonstrate their capabilities by training and comparing two deep learning object detection classifiers, Faster R-CNN and YOLO v2.0, to identify, quantify, and localize animal species within camera trap images using the Reconyx Camera Trap and the self-labeled Gold Standard Snapshot Serengeti data sets. When trained on large labeled datasets, object recognition methods have shown success. We demonstrate their use, in the context of realistically sized ecological data sets, by testing if object detection methods are applicable for ecological research scenarios when utilizing transfer learning. Faster R-CNN outperformed YOLO v2.0 with average accuracies of 93.0\% and 76.7\% on the two data sets, respectively. Our findings show promising steps towards the automation of the labourious task of labeling camera trap images, which can be used to improve our understanding of the population dynamics of ecosystems across the planet. 
### 585.Deep Photometric Stereo on a Sunny Day [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10850.pdf)
> Photometric Stereo in outdoor illumination remains a challenging, ill-posed problem. Indeed, it has been shown that the scene structure cannot be recovered unambiguously from the photometric cues alone when it is lit by the sun over the course of a single day. In this paper, we present a CNN-based technique for photometric stereo on a single sunny day. We solve the ambiguity issue by combining photometric cues with prior knowledge on material properties, local surface geometry and the natural variations in outdoor lighting. To train the CNN, we create a dataset of realistic synthetic renders with both diffuse and specular materials. Given eight outdoor images taken during a single sunny day, our method robustly estimates the scene surface normals. Our approach does not require precise geolocation to work and significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on images with real lighting. This shows that our CNN can combine efficiently learned priors and photometric cues available during a single sunny day. 
### 586.Features for Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking and Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10859.pdf)
> Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking (MTMCT) tracks many people through video taken from several cameras. Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) retrieves from a gallery images of people similar to a person query image. We learn good features for both MTMCT and Re-ID with a convolutional neural network. Our contributions include an adaptive weighted triplet loss for training and a new technique for hard-identity mining. Our method outperforms the state of the art both on the DukeMTMC benchmarks for tracking, and on the Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-ReID benchmarks for Re-ID. We examine the correlation between good Re-ID and good MTMCT scores, and perform ablation studies to elucidate the contributions of the main components of our system. Code is available. 
### 587.Memory Warps for Learning Long-Term Online Video Representations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10861.pdf)
> This paper proposes a novel memory-based online video representation that is efficient, accurate and predictive. This is in contrast to prior works that often rely on computationally heavy 3D convolutions, ignore actual motion when aligning features over time, or operate in an off-line mode to utilize future frames. In particular, our memory (i) holds the feature representation, (ii) is spatially warped over time to compensate for observer and scene motions, (iii) can carry long-term information, and (iv) enables predicting feature representations in future frames. By exploring a variant that operates at multiple temporal scales, we efficiently learn across even longer time horizons. We apply our online framework to object detection in videos, obtaining a large 2.3 times speed-up and losing only 0.9% mAP on ImageNet-VID dataset, compared to prior works that even use future frames. Finally, we demonstrate the predictive property of our representation in two novel detection setups, where features are propagated over time to (i) significantly enhance a real-time detector by more than 10% mAP in a multi-threaded online setup and to (ii) anticipate objects in future frames. 
### 588.A Survey on Deep Learning Methods for Robot Vision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10862.pdf)
> Deep learning has allowed a paradigm shift in pattern recognition, from using hand-crafted features together with statistical classifiers to using general-purpose learning procedures for learning data-driven representations, features, and classifiers together. The application of this new paradigm has been particularly successful in computer vision, in which the development of deep learning methods for vision applications has become a hot research topic. Given that deep learning has already attracted the attention of the robot vision community, the main purpose of this survey is to address the use of deep learning in robot vision. To achieve this, a comprehensive overview of deep learning and its usage in computer vision is given, that includes a description of the most frequently used neural models and their main application areas. Then, the standard methodology and tools used for designing deep-learning based vision systems are presented. Afterwards, a review of the principal work using deep learning in robot vision is presented, as well as current and future trends related to the use of deep learning in robotics. This survey is intended to be a guide for the developers of robot vision systems. 
### 589.Human Emotional Facial Expression Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10864.pdf)
> An automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) model with Adaboost face detector, feature selection based on manifold learning and synergetic prototype based classifier has been proposed. Improved feature selection method and proposed classifier can achieve favorable effectiveness to performance FER in reasonable processing time. 
### 590.Learning to Look around Objects for Top-View Representations of Outdoor  Scenes [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10870.pdf)
> Given a single RGB image of a complex outdoor road scene in the perspective view, we address the novel problem of estimating an occlusion-reasoned semantic scene layout in the top-view. This challenging problem not only requires an accurate understanding of both the 3D geometry and the semantics of the visible scene, but also of occluded areas. We propose a convolutional neural network that learns to predict occluded portions of the scene layout by looking around foreground objects like cars or pedestrians. But instead of hallucinating RGB values, we show that directly predicting the semantics and depths in the occluded areas enables a better transformation into the top-view. We further show that this initial top-view representation can be significantly enhanced by learning priors and rules about typical road layouts from simulated or, if available, map data. Crucially, training our model does not require costly or subjective human annotations for occluded areas or the top-view, but rather uses readily available annotations for standard semantic segmentation. We extensively evaluate and analyze our approach on the KITTI and Cityscapes data sets. 
### 591.Social GAN: Socially Acceptable Trajectories with Generative Adversarial  Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10892.pdf)
> Understanding human motion behavior is critical for autonomous moving platforms (like self-driving cars and social robots) if they are to navigate human-centric environments. This is challenging because human motion is inherently multimodal: given a history of human motion paths, there are many socially plausible ways that people could move in the future. We tackle this problem by combining tools from sequence prediction and generative adversarial networks: a recurrent sequence-to-sequence model observes motion histories and predicts future behavior, using a novel pooling mechanism to aggregate information across people. We predict socially plausible futures by training adversarially against a recurrent discriminator, and encourage diverse predictions with a novel variety loss. Through experiments on several datasets we demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior work in terms of accuracy, variety, collision avoidance, and computational complexity. 
### 592.Deep Texture Manifold for Ground Terrain Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10896.pdf)
> We present a texture network called Deep Encoding Pooling Network (DEP) for the task of ground terrain recognition. Recognition of ground terrain is an important task in establishing robot or vehicular control parameters, as well as for localization within an outdoor environment. The architecture of DEP integrates orderless texture details and local spatial information and the performance of DEP surpasses state-of-the-art methods for this task. The GTOS database (comprised of over 30,000 images of 40 classes of ground terrain in outdoor scenes) enables supervised recognition. For evaluation under realistic conditions, we use test images that are not from the existing GTOS dataset, but are instead from hand-held mobile phone videos of similar terrain. This new evaluation dataset, GTOS-mobile, consists of 81 videos of 31 classes of ground terrain such as grass, gravel, asphalt and sand. The resultant network shows excellent performance not only for GTOS-mobile, but also for more general databases (MINC and DTD). Leveraging the discriminant features learned from this network, we build a new texture manifold called DEP-manifold. We learn a parametric distribution in feature space in a fully supervised manner, which gives the distance relationship among classes and provides a means to implicitly represent ambiguous class boundaries. The source code and database are publicly available. 
### 593.Motion-Appearance Co-Memory Networks for Video Question Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10906.pdf)
> Video Question Answering (QA) is an important task in understanding video temporal structure. We observe that there are three unique attributes of video QA compared with image QA: (1) it deals with long sequences of images containing richer information not only in quantity but also in variety; (2) motion and appearance information are usually correlated with each other and able to provide useful attention cues to the other; (3) different questions require different number of frames to infer the answer. Based these observations, we propose a motion-appearance comemory network for video QA. Our networks are built on concepts from Dynamic Memory Network (DMN) and introduces new mechanisms for video QA. Specifically, there are three salient aspects: (1) a co-memory attention mechanism that utilizes cues from both motion and appearance to generate attention; (2) a temporal conv-deconv network to generate multi-level contextual facts; (3) a dynamic fact ensemble method to construct temporal representation dynamically for different questions. We evaluate our method on TGIF-QA dataset, and the results outperform state-of-the-art significantly on all four tasks of TGIF-QA. 
### 594.Deep Unsupervised Saliency Detection: A Multiple Noisy Labeling  Perspective [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10910.pdf)
> The success of current deep saliency detection methods heavily depends on the availability of large-scale supervision in the form of per-pixel labeling. Such supervision, while labor-intensive and not always possible, tends to hinder the generalization ability of the learned models. By contrast, traditional handcrafted features based unsupervised saliency detection methods, even though have been surpassed by the deep supervised methods, are generally dataset-independent and could be applied in the wild. This raises a natural question that "Is it possible to learn saliency maps without using labeled data while improving the generalization ability?". To this end, we present a novel perspective to unsupervised saliency detection through learning from multiple noisy labeling generated by "weak" and "noisy" unsupervised handcrafted saliency methods. Our end-to-end deep learning framework for unsupervised saliency detection consists of a latent saliency prediction module and a noise modeling module that work collaboratively and are optimized jointly. Explicit noise modeling enables us to deal with noisy saliency maps in a probabilistic way. Extensive experimental results on various benchmarking datasets show that our model not only outperforms all the unsupervised saliency methods with a large margin but also achieves comparable performance with the recent state-of-the-art supervised deep saliency methods. 
### 595.Adversarial Binary Coding for Efficient Person Re-identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10914.pdf)
> Person re-identification (ReID) aims at matching persons across different views/scenes. In addition to accuracy, the matching efficiency has received more and more attention because of demanding applications using large-scale data. Several binary coding based methods have been proposed for efficient ReID, which either learn projections to map high-dimensional features to compact binary codes, or directly adopt deep neural networks by simply inserting an additional fully-connected layer with tanh-like activations. However, the former approach requires time-consuming hand-crafted feature extraction and complicated (discrete) optimizations; the latter lacks the necessary discriminative information greatly due to the straightforward activation functions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for efficient ReID inspired by the recent advances in adversarial learning. Specifically, instead of learning explicit projections or adding fully-connected mapping layers, the proposed Adversarial Binary Coding (ABC) framework guides the extraction of binary codes implicitly and effectively. The discriminability of the extracted codes is further enhanced by equipping the ABC with a deep triplet network for the ReID task. More importantly, the ABC and triplet network are simultaneously optimized in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on three large-scale ReID benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods. 
### 596.B-DCGAN:Evaluation of Binarized DCGAN for FPGA [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10930.pdf)
> We are trying to implement deep neural networks in the edge computing environment for real-world applications such as the IoT(Internet of Things), the FinTech etc., for the purpose of utilizing the significant achievement of Deep Learning in recent years. Especially, we now focus algorithm implementation on FPGA, because FPGA is one of the promising devices for low-cost and low-power implementation of the edge computer. In this work, we introduce Binary-DCGAN(B-DCGAN) - Deep Convolutional GAN model with binary weights and activations, and with using integer-valued operations in forward pass(train-time and run-time). And we show how to implement B-DCGAN on FPGA(Xilinx Zynq). Using the B-DCGAN, we do feasibility study of FPGA's characteristic and performance for Deep Learning. Because the binarization and using integer-valued operation reduce the memory capacity and the number of the circuit gates, it is very effective for FPGA implementation. On the other hand, the quality of generated data from the model will be decreased by these reductions. So we investigate the influence of these reductions. 
### 597.Learning Free-Form Deformations for 3D Object Reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10932.pdf)
> Representing 3D shape in deep learning frameworks in an accurate, efficient and compact manner still remains an open challenge. Most existing work addresses this issue by employing voxel-based representations. While these approaches benefit greatly from advances in computer vision by generalizing 2D convolutions to the 3D setting, they also have several considerable drawbacks. The computational complexity of voxel-encodings grows cubically with the resolution thus limiting such representations to low-resolution 3D reconstruction. In an attempt to solve this problem, point cloud representations have been proposed. Although point clouds are more efficient than voxel representations as they only cover surfaces rather than volumes, they do not encode detailed geometric information about relationships between points. In this paper we propose a method to learn free-form deformations (FFD) for the task of 3D reconstruction from a single image. By learning to deform points sampled from a high-quality mesh, our trained model can be used to produce arbitrarily dense point clouds or meshes with fine-grained geometry. We evaluate our proposed framework on both synthetic and real-world data and achieve state-of-the-art results on point-cloud and volumetric metrics. Additionally, we qualitatively demonstrate its applicability to label transferring for 3D semantic segmentation. 
### 598.Context-aware Synthesis for Video Frame Interpolation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10967.pdf)
> Video frame interpolation algorithms typically estimate optical flow or its variations and then use it to guide the synthesis of an intermediate frame between two consecutive original frames. To handle challenges like occlusion, bidirectional flow between the two input frames is often estimated and used to warp and blend the input frames. However, how to effectively blend the two warped frames still remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a context-aware synthesis approach that warps not only the input frames but also their pixel-wise contextual information and uses them to interpolate a high-quality intermediate frame. Specifically, we first use a pre-trained neural network to extract per-pixel contextual information for input frames. We then employ a state-of-the-art optical flow algorithm to estimate bidirectional flow between them and pre-warp both input frames and their context maps. Finally, unlike common approaches that blend the pre-warped frames, our method feeds them and their context maps to a video frame synthesis neural network to produce the interpolated frame in a context-aware fashion. Our neural network is fully convolutional and is trained end to end. Our experiments show that our method can handle challenging scenarios such as occlusion and large motion and outperforms representative state-of-the-art approaches. 
### 599.A real-time warning system for rear-end collision based on random forest  classifier [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10988.pdf)
> Rear-end collision warning system has a great role to enhance the driving safety. In this system some measures are used to estimate the dangers and the system warns drivers to be more cautious. The real-time processes should be executed in such system, to remain enough time and distance to avoid collision with the front vehicle. To this end, in this paper a new system is developed by using random forest classifier. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, vehicles trajectory data of 100 car's database from Virginia tech transportation institute are used and the methods are compared based on their accuracy and their processing time. By using TOPSIS multi-criteria selection method, we show that the results of the implemented classifier is better than the results of different classifiers including Bayesian network, naive Bayes, MLP neural network, support vector machine, nearest neighbor, rule-based methods and decision tree. The presented experiments reveals that the random forest is an acceptable algorithm for the proposed driver assistant system with 88.4% accuracy for detecting warning situations and 94.7% for detecting safe situations. 
### 600.Structured Attention Guided Convolutional Neural Fields for Monocular  Depth Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11029.pdf)
> Recent works have shown the benefit of integrating Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) models into deep architectures for improving pixel-level prediction tasks. Following this line of research, in this paper we introduce a novel approach for monocular depth estimation. Similarly to previous works, our method employs a continuous CRF to fuse multi-scale information derived from different layers of a front-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Differently from past works, our approach benefits from a structured attention model which automatically regulates the amount of information transferred between corresponding features at different scales. Importantly, the proposed attention model is seamlessly integrated into the CRF, allowing end-to-end training of the entire architecture. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method which is competitive with previous methods on the KITTI benchmark and outperforms the state of the art on the NYU Depth V2 dataset. 
### 601.Non-Linear Temporal Subspace Representations for Activity Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11064.pdf)
> Representations that can compactly and effectively capture the temporal evolution of semantic content are important to computer vision and machine learning algorithms that operate on multi-variate time-series data. We investigate such representations motivated by the task of human action recognition. Here each data instance is encoded by a multivariate feature (such as via a deep CNN) where action dynamics are characterized by their variations in time. As these features are often non-linear, we propose a novel pooling method, kernelized rank pooling, that represents a given sequence compactly as the pre-image of the parameters of a hyperplane in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, projections of data onto which captures their temporal order. We develop this idea further and show that such a pooling scheme can be cast as an order-constrained kernelized PCA objective. We then propose to use the parameters of a kernelized low-rank feature subspace as the representation of the sequences. We cast our formulation as an optimization problem on generalized Grassmann manifolds and then solve it efficiently using Riemannian optimization techniques. We present experiments on several action recognition datasets using diverse feature modalities and demonstrate state-of-the-art results. 
### 602.Asymmetric Similarity Loss Function to Balance Precision and Recall in  Highly Unbalanced Deep Medical Image Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11078.pdf)
> Fully convolutional deep neural networks have been asserted to be fast and precise frameworks with great potential in image segmentation. One of the major challenges in utilizing such networks raises when data is unbalanced, which is common in many medical imaging applications such as lesion segmentation where lesion class voxels are often much lower in numbers than non-lesion voxels. A trained network with unbalanced data may make predictions with high precision and low recall, being severely biased towards the non-lesion class which is particularly undesired in medical applications where false negatives are actually more important than false positives. Various methods have been proposed to address this problem including two step training, sample re-weighting, balanced sampling, and similarity loss functions. In this paper we developed a patch-wise 3D densely connected network with an asymmetric loss function, where we used large overlapping image patches for intrinsic and extrinsic data augmentation, a patch selection algorithm, and a patch prediction fusion strategy based on B-spline weighted soft voting to take into account the uncertainty of prediction in patch borders. We applied this method to lesion segmentation based on the MSSEG 2016 and ISBI 2015 challenges, where we achieved average Dice similarity coefficient of 69.9% and 65.74%, respectively. In addition to the proposed loss, we trained our network with focal and generalized Dice loss functions. Significant improvement in $F_1$ and $F_2$ scores and the APR curve was achieved in test using the asymmetric similarity loss layer and our 3D patch prediction fusion. The asymmetric similarity loss based on $F_\beta$ scores generalizes the Dice similarity coefficient and can be effectively used with the patch-wise strategy developed here to train fully convolutional deep neural networks for highly unbalanced image segmentation. 
### 603.3D Consistent Biventricular Myocardial Segmentation Using Deep Learning  for Mesh Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11080.pdf)
> We present a novel automated method to segment the myocardium of both left and right ventricles in MRI volumes. The segmentation is consistent in 3D across the slices such that it can be directly used for mesh generation. Two specific neural networks with multi-scale coarse-to-fine prediction structure are proposed to cope with the small training dataset and trained using an original loss function. The former segments a slice in the middle of the volume. Then the latter iteratively propagates the slice segmentations towards the base and the apex, in a spatially consistent way. We perform 5-fold cross-validation on the 15 cases from STACOM to validate the method. For training, we use real cases and their synthetic variants generated by combining motion simulation and image synthesis. Accurate and consistent testing results are obtained. 
### 604.Webcam-based Eye Gaze Tracking under Natural Head Movement [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11088.pdf)
> This manuscript investigates and proposes a visual gaze tracker that tackles the problem using only an ordinary web camera and no prior knowledge in any sense (scene set-up, camera intrinsic and/or extrinsic parameters). The tracker we propose is based on the observation that our desire to grant the freedom of natural head movement to the user requires 3D modeling of the scene set-up. Although, using a single low resolution web camera bounds us in dimensions (no depth can be recovered), we propose ways to cope with this drawback and model the scene in front of the user. We tackle this three-dimensional problem by realizing that it can be viewed as series of two-dimensional special cases. Then, we propose a procedure that treats each movement of the user's head as a special two-dimensional case, hence reducing the complexity of the problem back to two dimensions. Furthermore, the proposed tracker is calibration free and discards this tedious part of all previously mentioned trackers. <br />Experimental results show that the proposed tracker achieves good results, given the restrictions on it. We can report that the tracker commits a mean error of (56.95, 70.82) pixels in x and y direction, respectively, when the user's head is as static as possible (no chin-rests are used). Furthermore, we can report that the proposed tracker commits a mean error of (87.18, 103.86) pixels in x and y direction, respectively, under natural head movement. 
### 605.Mining on Manifolds: Metric Learning without Labels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11095.pdf)
> In this work we present a novel unsupervised framework for hard training example mining. The only input to the method is a collection of images relevant to the target application and a meaningful initial representation, provided e.g. by pre-trained CNN. Positive examples are distant points on a single manifold, while negative examples are nearby points on different manifolds. Both types of examples are revealed by disagreements between Euclidean and manifold similarities. The discovered examples can be used in training with any discriminative loss. The method is applied to unsupervised fine-tuning of pre-trained networks for fine-grained classification and particular object retrieval. Our models are on par or are outperforming prior models that are fully or partially supervised. 
### 606.Learning Deep Models for Face Anti-Spoofing: Binary or Auxiliary  Supervision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11097.pdf)
> Face anti-spoofing is the crucial step to prevent face recognition systems from a security breach. Previous deep learning approaches formulate face anti-spoofing as a binary classification problem. Many of them struggle to grasp adequate spoofing cues and generalize poorly. In this paper, we argue the importance of auxiliary supervision to guide the learning toward discriminative and generalizable cues. A CNN-RNN model is learned to estimate the face depth with pixel-wise supervision, and to estimate rPPG signals with sequence-wise supervision. Then we fuse the estimated depth and rPPG to distinguish live vs. spoof faces. In addition, we introduce a new face anti-spoofing database that covers a large range of illumination, subject, and pose variations. Experimental results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both intra-database and cross-database testing. 
### 607.Bag of Recurrence Patterns Representation for Time-Series Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11111.pdf)
> Time-Series Classification (TSC) has attracted a lot of attention in pattern recognition, because wide range of applications from different domains such as finance and health informatics deal with time-series signals. Bag of Features (BoF) model has achieved a great success in TSC task by summarizing signals according to the frequencies of "feature words" of a data-learned dictionary. This paper proposes embedding the Recurrence Plots (RP), a visualization technique for analysis of dynamic systems, in the BoF model for TSC. While the traditional BoF approach extracts features from 1D signal segments, this paper uses the RP to transform time-series into 2D texture images and then applies the BoF on them. Image representation of time-series enables us to explore different visual descriptors that are not available for 1D signals and to treats TSC task as a texture recognition problem. Experimental results on the UCI time-series classification archive demonstrates a significant accuracy boost by the proposed Bag of Recurrence patterns (BoR), compared not only to the existing BoF models, but also to the state-of-the art algorithms. 
### 608.Learning Kinematic Descriptions using SPARE: Simulated and Physical  ARticulated Extendable dataset [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11147.pdf)
> Next generation robots will need to understand intricate and articulated objects as they cooperate in human environments. To do so, these robots will need to move beyond their current abilities--- working with relatively simple objects in a task-indifferent manner--- toward more sophisticated abilities that dynamically estimate the properties of complex, articulated objects. To that end, we make two compelling contributions toward general articulated (physical) object understanding in this paper. First, we introduce a new dataset, SPARE: Simulated and Physical ARticulated Extendable dataset. SPARE is an extendable open-source dataset providing equivalent simulated and physical instances of articulated objects (kinematic chains), providing the greater research community with a training and evaluation tool for methods generating kinematic descriptions of articulated objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first joint visual and physical (3D-printable) dataset for the Vision community. Second, we present a deep neural network that can predit the number of links and the length of the links of an articulated object. These new ideas outperform classical approaches to understanding kinematic chains, such tracking-based methods, which fail in the case of occlusion and do not leverage multiple views when available. 
### 609.Security Consideration For Deep Learning-Based Image Forensics [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11157.pdf)
> Recently, image forensics community has paied attention to the research on the design of effective algorithms based on deep learning technology and facts proved that combining the domain knowledge of image forensics and deep learning would achieve more robust and better performance than the traditional schemes. Instead of improving it, in this paper, the safety of deep learning based methods in the field of image forensics is taken into account. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first work focusing on this topic. Specifically, we experimentally find that the method using deep learning would fail when adding the slight noise into the images (adversarial images). Furthermore, two kinds of strategys are proposed to enforce security of deep learning-based method. Firstly, an extra penalty term to the loss function is added, which is referred to the 2-norm of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input images, and then an novel training method are adopt to train the model by fusing the normal and adversarial images. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve good performance even in the case of adversarial images and provide a safety consideration for deep learning-based image forensics 
### 610.Towards Open-Set Identity Preserving Face Synthesis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11182.pdf)
> We propose a framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks to disentangle the identity and attributes of faces, such that we can conveniently recombine different identities and attributes for identity preserving face synthesis in open domains. Previous identity preserving face synthesis processes are largely confined to synthesizing faces with known identities that are already in the training dataset. To synthesize a face with identity outside the training dataset, our framework requires one input image of that subject to produce an identity vector, and any other input face image to extract an attribute vector capturing, e.g., pose, emotion, illumination, and even the background. We then recombine the identity vector and the attribute vector to synthesize a new face of the subject with the extracted attribute. Our proposed framework does not need to annotate the attributes of faces in any way. It is trained with an asymmetric loss function to better preserve the identity and stabilize the training process. It can also effectively leverage large amounts of unlabeled training face images to further improve the fidelity of the synthesized faces for subjects that are not presented in the labeled training face dataset. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. We also present its usage in a much broader set of applications including face frontalization, face attribute morphing, and face adversarial example detection. 
### 611.Unsupervised Textual Grounding: Linking Words to Image Concepts [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11185.pdf)
> Textual grounding, i.e., linking words to objects in images, is a challenging but important task for robotics and human-computer interaction. Existing techniques benefit from recent progress in deep learning and generally formulate the task as a supervised learning problem, selecting a bounding box from a set of possible options. To train these deep net based approaches, access to a large-scale datasets is required, however, constructing such a dataset is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, we develop a completely unsupervised mechanism for textual grounding using hypothesis testing as a mechanism to link words to detected image concepts. We demonstrate our approach on the ReferIt Game dataset and the Flickr30k data, outperforming baselines by 7.98% and 6.96% respectively. 
### 612.Two can play this Game: Visual Dialog with Discriminative Question  Generation and Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11186.pdf)
> Human conversation is a complex mechanism with subtle nuances. It is hence an ambitious goal to develop artificial intelligence agents that can participate fluently in a conversation. While we are still far from achieving this goal, recent progress in visual question answering, image captioning, and visual question generation shows that dialog systems may be realizable in the not too distant future. To this end, a novel dataset was introduced recently and encouraging results were demonstrated, particularly for question answering. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple symmetric discriminative baseline, that can be applied to both predicting an answer as well as predicting a question. We show that this method performs on par with the state of the art, even memory net based methods. In addition, for the first time on the visual dialog dataset, we assess the performance of a system asking questions, and demonstrate how visual dialog can be generated from discriminative question generation and question answering. 
### 613.MaskRNN: Instance Level Video Object Segmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11187.pdf)
> Instance level video object segmentation is an important technique for video editing and compression. To capture the temporal coherence, in this paper, we develop MaskRNN, a recurrent neural net approach which fuses in each frame the output of two deep nets for each object instance -- a binary segmentation net providing a mask and a localization net providing a bounding box. Due to the recurrent component and the localization component, our method is able to take advantage of long-term temporal structures of the video data as well as rejecting outliers. We validate the proposed algorithm on three challenging benchmark datasets, the DAVIS-2016 dataset, the DAVIS-2017 dataset, and the Segtrack v2 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all of them. 
### 614.Generative Modeling using the Sliced Wasserstein Distance [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11188.pdf)
> Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) are very successful at modeling distributions from given samples, even in the high-dimensional case. However, their formulation is also known to be hard to optimize and often not stable. While this is particularly true for early GAN formulations, there has been significant empirically motivated and theoretically founded progress to improve stability, for instance, by using the Wasserstein distance rather than the Jenson-Shannon divergence. Here, we consider an alternative formulation for generative modeling based on random projections which, in its simplest form, results in a single objective rather than a saddle-point formulation. By augmenting this approach with a discriminator we improve its accuracy. We found our approach to be significantly more stable compared to even the improved Wasserstein GAN. Further, unlike the traditional GAN loss, the loss formulated in our method is a good measure of the actual distance between the distributions and, for the first time for GAN training, we are able to show estimates for the same. 
### 615.Iterative Visual Reasoning Beyond Convolutions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11189.pdf)
> We present a novel framework for iterative visual reasoning. Our framework goes beyond current recognition systems that lack the capability to reason beyond stack of convolutions. The framework consists of two core modules: a local module that uses spatial memory to store previous beliefs with parallel updates; and a global graph-reasoning module. Our graph module has three components: a) a knowledge graph where we represent classes as nodes and build edges to encode different types of semantic relationships between them; b) a region graph of the current image where regions in the image are nodes and spatial relationships between these regions are edges; c) an assignment graph that assigns regions to classes. Both the local module and the global module roll-out iteratively and cross-feed predictions to each other to refine estimates. The final predictions are made by combining the best of both modules with an attention mechanism. We show strong performance over plain ConvNets, \eg achieving an $8.4\%$ absolute improvement on ADE measured by per-class average precision. Analysis also shows that the framework is resilient to missing regions for reasoning. 
### 616.Interpretable and Globally Optimal Prediction for Textual Grounding  using Image Concepts [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11209.pdf)
> Textual grounding is an important but challenging task for human-computer interaction, robotics and knowledge mining. Existing algorithms generally formulate the task as selection from a set of bounding box proposals obtained from deep net based systems. In this work, we demonstrate that we can cast the problem of textual grounding into a unified framework that permits efficient search over all possible bounding boxes. Hence, the method is able to consider significantly more proposals and doesn't rely on a successful first stage hypothesizing bounding box proposals. Beyond, we demonstrate that the trained parameters of our model can be used as word-embeddings which capture spatial-image relationships and provide interpretability. Lastly, at the time of submission, our approach outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods on the Flickr 30k Entities and the ReferItGame dataset by 3.08% and 7.77% respectively. 
### 617.Joint Person Segmentation and Identification in Synchronized First- and  Third-person Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11217.pdf)
> In a world of pervasive cameras, public spaces are often captured from multiple perspectives by cameras of different types, both fixed and mobile. An important problem is to organize these heterogeneous collections of videos by finding connections between them, such as identifying correspondences between the people appearing in the videos and the people holding or wearing the cameras. In this paper, we wish to solve two specific problems: (1) given two or more synchronized third-person videos of a scene, produce a pixel-level segmentation of each visible person and identify corresponding people across different views (i.e., determine who in camera A corresponds with whom in camera B), and (2) given one or more synchronized third-person videos as well as a first-person video taken by a mobile or wearable camera, segment and identify the camera wearer in the third-person videos. Unlike previous work which requires ground truth bounding boxes to estimate the correspondences, we perform person segmentation and identification jointly. We find that solving these two problems simultaneously is mutually beneficial, because better fine-grained segmentation allows us to better perform matching across views, and information from multiple views helps us perform more accurate segmentation. We evaluate our approach on two challenging datasets of interacting people captured from multiple wearable cameras, and show that our proposed method performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art on both person segmentation and identification. 
### 618.The Price is Right: Predicting Prices with Product Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11227.pdf)
> In this work, we build an ensemble of machine learning models to predict the price of a product given its image, and visualize the features that result in higher or lower price predictions. We collect two novel datasets of product images and their MSRP prices for this purpose: a bicycle dataset and a car dataset. We set baselines for price regression using linear regression on histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and convolutional neural network (CNN) features, and a baseline for price segment classification using a multiclass SVM. For our main models, we train several deep CNNs using both transfer learning and our own architectures, for both regression and classification. We achieve strong results on both datasets, with deep CNNs significantly outperforming other models in a variety of metrics. Finally, we use several recently-developed methods to visualize the image features that result in higher or lower prices. 
### 619.Euphrates: Algorithm-SoC Co-Design for Low-Power Mobile Continuous  Vision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11232.pdf)
> Continuous computer vision (CV) tasks increasingly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, CNNs have massive compute demands that far exceed the performance and energy constraints of mobile devices. In this paper, we propose and develop an algorithm-architecture co-designed system, Euphrates, that simultaneously improves the energy-efficiency and performance of continuous vision tasks. <br />Our key observation is that changes in pixel data between consecutive frames represents visual motion. We first propose an algorithm that leverages this motion information to relax the number of expensive CNN inferences required by continuous vision applications. We co-design a mobile System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architecture to maximize the efficiency of the new algorithm. The key to our architectural augmentation is to co-optimize different SoC IP blocks in the vision pipeline collectively. Specifically, we propose to expose the motion data that is naturally generated by the Image Signal Processor (ISP) early in the vision pipeline to the CNN engine. Measurement and synthesis results show that Euphrates achieves up to 66% SoC-level energy savings (4 times for the vision computations), with only 1% accuracy loss. 
### 620.Improve the performance of transfer learning without fine-tuning using  dissimilarity-based multi-view learning for breast cancer histology images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11241.pdf)
> Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and leading cancer-related death causes for women. In the context of ICIAR 2018 Grand Challenge on Breast Cancer Histology Images, we compare one handcrafted feature extractor and five transfer learning feature extractors based on deep learning. We find out that the deep learning networks pretrained on ImageNet have better performance than the popular handcrafted features used for breast cancer histology images. The best feature extractor achieves an average accuracy of 79.30%. To improve the classification performance, a random forest dissimilarity based integration method is used to combine different feature groups together. When the five deep learning feature groups are combined, the average accuracy is improved to 82.90% (best accuracy 85.00%). When handcrafted features are combined with the five deep learning feature groups, the average accuracy is improved to 87.10% (best accuracy 93.00%). 
### 621.DIY Human Action Data Set Generation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11264.pdf)
> The recent successes in applying deep learning techniques to solve standard computer vision problems has aspired researchers to propose new computer vision problems in different domains. As previously established in the field, training data itself plays a significant role in the machine learning process, especially deep learning approaches which are data hungry. In order to solve each new problem and get a decent performance, a large amount of data needs to be captured which may in many cases pose logistical difficulties. Therefore, the ability to generate de novo data or expand an existing data set, however small, in order to satisfy data requirement of current networks may be invaluable. Herein, we introduce a novel way to partition an action video clip into action, subject and context. Each part is manipulated separately and reassembled with our proposed video generation technique. Furthermore, our novel human skeleton trajectory generation along with our proposed video generation technique, enables us to generate unlimited action recognition training data. These techniques enables us to generate video action clips from an small set without costly and time-consuming data acquisition. Lastly, we prove through extensive set of experiments on two small human action recognition data sets, that this new data generation technique can improve the performance of current action recognition neural nets. 
### 622.Two-Stream Neural Networks for Tampered Face Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11276.pdf)
> We propose a two-stream network for face tampering detection. We train GoogLeNet to detect tampering artifacts in a face classification stream, and train a patch based triplet network to leverage features capturing local noise residuals and camera characteristics as a second stream. In addition, we use two different online face swapping applications to create a new dataset that consists of 2010 tampered images, each of which contains a tampered face. We evaluate the proposed two-stream network on our newly collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. 
### 623.Revisiting Oxford and Paris: Large-Scale Image Retrieval Benchmarking [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11285.pdf)
> In this paper we address issues with image retrieval benchmarking on standard and popular Oxford 5k and Paris 6k datasets. In particular, annotation errors, the size of the dataset, and the level of challenge are addressed: new annotation for both datasets is created with an extra attention to the reliability of the ground truth. Three new protocols of varying difficulty are introduced. The protocols allow fair comparison between different methods, including those using a dataset pre-processing stage. For each dataset, 15 new challenging queries are introduced. Finally, a new set of 1M hard, semi-automatically cleaned distractors is selected. <br />An extensive comparison of the state-of-the-art methods is performed on the new benchmark. Different types of methods are evaluated, ranging from local-feature-based to modern CNN based methods. The best results are achieved by taking the best of the two worlds. Most importantly, image retrieval appears far from being solved. 
### 624.Deep learning-based virtual histology staining using auto-fluorescence  of label-free tissue [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11293.pdf)
> Histological analysis of tissue samples is one of the most widely used methods for disease diagnosis. After taking a sample from a patient, it goes through a lengthy and laborious preparation, which stains the tissue to visualize different histological features under a microscope. Here, we demonstrate a label-free approach to create a virtually-stained microscopic image using a single wide-field auto-fluorescence image of an unlabeled tissue sample, bypassing the standard histochemical staining process, saving time and cost. This method is based on deep learning, and uses a convolutional neural network trained using a generative adversarial network model to transform an auto-fluorescence image of an unlabeled tissue section into an image that is equivalent to the bright-field image of the stained-version of the same sample. We validated this method by successfully creating virtually-stained microscopic images of human tissue samples, including sections of salivary gland, thyroid, kidney, liver and lung tissue, also covering three different stains. This label-free virtual-staining method eliminates cumbersome and costly histochemical staining procedures, and would significantly simplify tissue preparation in pathology and histology fields. 
### 625.Pancreas Segmentation in CT and MRI Images via Domain Specific Network  Designing and Recurrent Neural Contextual Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11303.pdf)
> Automatic pancreas segmentation in radiology images, eg., computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is frequently required by computer-aided screening, diagnosis, and quantitative assessment. Yet pancreas is a challenging abdominal organ to segment due to the high inter-patient anatomical variability in both shape and volume metrics. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated promising performance on accurate segmentation of pancreas. However, the CNN-based method often suffers from segmentation discontinuity for reasons such as noisy image quality and blurry pancreatic boundary. From this point, we propose to introduce recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address the problem of spatial non-smoothness of inter-slice pancreas segmentation across adjacent image slices. To inference initial segmentation, we first train a 2D CNN sub-network, where we modify its network architecture with deep-supervision and multi-scale feature map aggregation so that it can be trained from scratch with small-sized training data and presents superior performance than transferred models. Thereafter, the successive CNN outputs are processed by another RNN sub-network, which refines the consistency of segmented shapes. More specifically, the RNN sub-network consists convolutional long short-term memory (CLSTM) units in both top-down and bottom-up directions, which regularizes the segmentation of an image by integrating predictions of its neighboring slices. We train the stacked CNN-RNN model end-to-end and perform quantitative evaluations on both CT and MRI images. 
### 626.Fast and Robust Subspace Clustering Using Random Projections [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11305.pdf)
> Over the past several decades, subspace clustering has been receiving increasing interest and continuous progress. However, due to the lack of scalability and/or robustness, existing methods still have difficulty in dealing with the data that possesses simultaneously three characteristics: high-dimensional, massive and grossly corrupted. To tackle the scalability and robustness issues simultaneously, in this paper we suggest to consider a problem called compressive robust subspace clustering, which is to perform robust subspace clustering with the compressed data, and which is generated by projecting the original high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace chosen at random. Given these random projections, the proposed method, row space pursuit (RSP), recovers not only the authentic row space, which provably leads to correct clustering results under certain conditions, but also the gross errors possibly existing in data. The compressive nature of the random projections gives our RSP high computational and storage efficiency, and the recovery property enables the ability for RSP to deal with the grossly corrupted data. Extensive experiments on high-dimensional and/or large-scale datasets show that RSP can maintain comparable accuracies to to prevalent methods with significant reductions in the computational time. 
### 627.Task-Driven Super Resolution: Object Detection in Low-resolution Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11316.pdf)
> We consider how image super resolution (SR) can contribute to an object detection task in low-resolution images. Intuitively, SR gives a positive impact on the object detection task. While several previous works demonstrated that this intuition is correct, SR and detector are optimized independently in these works. This paper proposes a novel framework to train a deep neural network where the SR sub-network explicitly incorporates a detection loss in its training objective, via a tradeoff with a traditional detection loss. This end-to-end training procedure allows us to train SR preprocessing for any differentiable detector. We demonstrate that our task-driven SR consistently and significantly improves accuracy of an object detector on low-resolution images for a variety of conditions and scaling factors. 
### 628.Transductive Unbiased Embedding for Zero-Shot Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11320.pdf)
> Most existing Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) methods have the strong bias problem, in which instances of unseen (target) classes tend to be categorized as one of the seen (source) classes. So they yield poor performance after being deployed in the generalized ZSL settings. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet effective method named Quasi-Fully Supervised Learning (QFSL) to alleviate the bias problem. Our method follows the way of transductive learning, which assumes that both the labeled source images and unlabeled target images are available for training. In the semantic embedding space, the labeled source images are mapped to several fixed points specified by the source categories, and the unlabeled target images are forced to be mapped to other points specified by the target categories. Experiments conducted on AwA2, CUB and SUN datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by a huge margin of 9.3~24.5% following generalized ZSL settings, and by a large margin of 0.2~16.2% following conventional ZSL settings. 
### 629.Learning View-Specific Deep Networks for Person Re-Identification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11333.pdf)
> In recent years, a growing body of research has focused on the problem of person re-identification (re-id). The re-id techniques attempt to match the images of pedestrians from disjoint non-overlapping camera views. A major challenge of re-id is the serious intra-class variations caused by changing viewpoints. To overcome this challenge, we propose a deep neural network-based framework which utilizes the view information in the feature extraction stage. The proposed framework learns a view-specific network for each camera view with a cross-view Euclidean constraint (CV-EC) and a cross-view center loss (CV-CL). We utilize CV-EC to decrease the margin of the features between diverse views and extend the center loss metric to a view-specific version to better adapt the re-id problem. Moreover, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the parameters of the view-specific networks from coarse to fine. The experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of the existing deep networks and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the VIPeR, CUHK01, CUHK03, SYSU-mReId, and Market-1501 benchmarks. 
### 630.Efficient and Deep Person Re-Identification using Multi-Level Similarity [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11353.pdf)
> Person Re-Identification (ReID) requires comparing two images of person captured under different conditions. Existing work based on neural networks often computes the similarity of feature maps from one single convolutional layer. In this work, we propose an efficient, end-to-end fully convolutional Siamese network that computes the similarities at multiple levels. We demonstrate that multi-level similarity can improve the accuracy considerably using low-complexity network structures in ReID problem. Specifically, first, we use several convolutional layers to extract the features of two input images. Then, we propose Convolution Similarity Network to compute the similarity score maps for the inputs. We use spatial transformer networks (STNs) to determine spatial attention. We propose to apply efficient depth-wise convolution to compute the similarity. The proposed Convolution Similarity Networks can be inserted into different convolutional layers to extract visual similarities at different levels. Furthermore, we use an improved ranking loss to further improve the performance. Our work is the first to propose to compute visual similarities at low, middle and high levels for ReID. With extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our system, compact yet effective, can achieve competitive results with much smaller model size and computational complexity. 
### 631.DDRprog: A CLEVR Differentiable Dynamic Reasoning Programmer [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11361.pdf)
> We present a novel Dynamic Differentiable Reasoning (DDR) framework for jointly learning branching programs and the functions composing them; this resolves a significant nondifferentiability inhibiting recent dynamic architectures. We apply our framework to two settings in two highly compact and data efficient architectures: DDRprog for CLEVR Visual Question Answering and DDRstack for reverse Polish notation expression evaluation. DDRprog uses a recurrent controller to jointly predict and execute modular neural programs that directly correspond to the underlying question logic; it explicitly forks subprocesses to handle logical branching. By effectively leveraging additional structural supervision, we achieve a large improvement over previous approaches in subtask consistency and a small improvement in overall accuracy. We further demonstrate the benefits of structural supervision in the RPN setting: the inclusion of a stack assumption in DDRstack allows our approach to generalize to long expressions where an LSTM fails the task. 
### 632.Joint Optimization Framework for Learning with Noisy Labels [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11364.pdf)
> Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on large-scale datasets have exhibited significant performance in image classification. Many large-scale datasets are collected from websites, however they tend to contain inaccurate labels that are termed as noisy labels. Training on such noisy labeled datasets causes performance degradation because DNNs easily overfit to noisy labels. To overcome this problem, we propose a joint optimization framework of learning DNN parameters and estimating true labels. Our framework can correct labels during training by alternating update of network parameters and labels. We conduct experiments on the noisy CIFAR-10 datasets and the Clothing1M dataset. The results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. 
### 633.Cross-Domain Weakly-Supervised Object Detection through Progressive  Domain Adaptation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11365.pdf)
> Can we detect common objects in a variety of image domains without instance-level annotations? In this paper, we present a framework for a novel task, cross-domain weakly supervised object detection, which addresses this question. For this paper, we have access to images with instance-level annotations in a source domain (e.g., natural image) and images with image-level annotations in a target domain (e.g., watercolor). In addition, the classes to be detected in the target domain are all or a subset of those in the source domain. Starting from a fully supervised object detector, which is pre-trained on the source domain, we propose a two-step progressive domain adaptation technique by fine-tuning the detector on two types of artificially and automatically generated samples. We test our methods on our newly collected datasets containing three image domains, and achieve an improvement of approximately 5 to 20 percentage points in terms of mean average precision (mAP) compared to the best-performing baselines. 
### 634.Disentangling Features in 3D Face Shapes for Joint Face Reconstruction  and Recognition [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11366.pdf)
> This paper proposes an encoder-decoder network to disentangle shape features during 3D face reconstruction from single 2D images, such that the tasks of reconstructing accurate 3D face shapes and learning discriminative shape features for face recognition can be accomplished simultaneously. Unlike existing 3D face reconstruction methods, our proposed method directly regresses dense 3D face shapes from single 2D images, and tackles identity and residual (i.e., non-identity) components in 3D face shapes explicitly and separately based on a composite 3D face shape model with latent representations. We devise a training process for the proposed network with a joint loss measuring both face identification error and 3D face shape reconstruction error. To construct training data we develop a method for fitting 3D morphable model (3DMM) to multiple 2D images of a subject. Comprehensive experiments have been done on MICC, BU3DFE, LFW and YTF databases. The results show that our method expands the capacity of 3DMM for capturing discriminative shape features and facial detail, and thus outperforms existing methods both in 3D face reconstruction accuracy and in face recognition accuracy. 
### 635.Parallel Grid Pooling for Data Augmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11370.pdf)
> Convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures utilize downsampling layers, which restrict the subsequent layers to learn spatially invariant features while reducing computational costs. However, such a downsampling operation makes it impossible to use the full spectrum of input features. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel layer called parallel grid pooling (PGP) which is applicable to various CNN models. PGP performs downsampling without discarding any intermediate feature. It works as data augmentation and is complementary to commonly used data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a dilated convolution can naturally be represented using PGP operations, which suggests that the dilated convolution can also be regarded as a type of data augmentation technique. Experimental results based on popular image classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### 636.Contrast-Oriented Deep Neural Networks for Salient Object Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11395.pdf)
> Deep convolutional neural networks have become a key element in the recent breakthrough of salient object detection. However, existing CNN-based methods are based on either patch-wise (region-wise) training and inference or fully convolutional networks. Methods in the former category are generally time-consuming due to severe storage and computational redundancies among overlapping patches. To overcome this deficiency, methods in the second category attempt to directly map a raw input image to a predicted dense saliency map in a single network forward pass. Though being very efficient, it is arduous for these methods to detect salient objects of different scales or salient regions with weak semantic information. In this paper, we develop hybrid contrast-oriented deep neural networks to overcome the aforementioned limitations. Each of our deep networks is composed of two complementary components, including a fully convolutional stream for dense prediction and a segment-level spatial pooling stream for sparse saliency inference. We further propose an attentional module that learns weight maps for fusing the two saliency predictions from these two streams. A tailored alternate scheme is designed to train these deep networks by fine-tuning pre-trained baseline models. Finally, a customized fully connected CRF model incorporating a salient contour feature embedding can be optionally applied as a post-processing step to improve spatial coherence and contour positioning in the fused result from these two streams. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can significantly outperform the state of the art in terms of all popular evaluation metrics. 
### 637.Cross-modal Deep Variational Hand Pose Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11404.pdf)
> The human hand moves in complex and high-dimensional ways, making estimation of 3D hand pose configurations from images alone a challenging task. In this work we propose a method to learn a statistical hand model represented by a cross-modal trained latent space via a generative deep neural network. We derive an objective function from the variational lower bound of the VAE framework and jointly optimize the resulting cross-modal KL-divergence and the posterior reconstruction objective, naturally admitting a training regime that leads to a coherent latent space across multiple modalities such as RGB images, 2D keypoint detections or 3D hand configurations. Additionally, it grants a straightforward way of using semi-supervision. This latent space can be directly used to estimate 3D hand poses from RGB images, outperforming the state-of-the art in different settings. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method can be used without changes on depth images and performs comparably to specialized methods. Finally, the model is fully generative and can synthesize consistent pairs of hand configurations across modalities. We evaluate our method on both RGB and depth datasets and analyze the latent space qualitatively. 
### 638.Learning Structure and Strength of CNN Filters for Small Sample Size  Training [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11405.pdf)
> Convolutional Neural Networks have provided state-of-the-art results in several computer vision problems. However, due to a large number of parameters in CNNs, they require a large number of training samples which is a limiting factor for small sample size problems. To address this limitation, we propose SSF-CNN which focuses on learning the structure and strength of filters. The structure of the filter is initialized using a dictionary-based filter learning algorithm and the strength of the filter is learned using the small sample training data. The architecture provides the flexibility of training with both small and large training databases and yields good accuracies even with small size training data. The effectiveness of the algorithm is first demonstrated on MNIST, CIFAR10, and NORB databases, with a varying number of training samples. The results show that SSF-CNN significantly reduces the number of parameters required for training while providing high accuracies the test databases. On small sample size problems such as newborn face recognition and Omniglot, it yields state-of-the-art results. Specifically, on the IIITD Newborn Face Database, the results demonstrate improvement in rank-1 identification accuracy by at least 10%. 
### 639.Scalable Deep Learning Logo Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11417.pdf)
> Existing logo detection methods usually consider a small number of logo classes and limited images per class with a strong assumption of requiring tedious object bounding box annotations, therefore not scalable to real-world dynamic applications. In this work, we tackle these challenges by exploring the webly data learning principle without the need for exhaustive manual labelling. Specifically, we propose a novel incremental learning approach, called Scalable Logo Self-co-Learning (SL^2), capable of automatically self-discovering informative training images from noisy web data for progressively improving model capability in a cross-model co-learning manner. Moreover, we introduce a very large (2,190,757 images of 194 logo classes) logo dataset "WebLogo-2M" by an automatic web data collection and processing method. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SL^2 method over the state-of-the-art strongly and weakly supervised detection models and contemporary webly data learning approaches. 
### 640.Reconstruction Network for Video Captioning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11438.pdf)
> In this paper, the problem of describing visual contents of a video sequence with natural language is addressed. Unlike previous video captioning work mainly exploiting the cues of video contents to make a language description, we propose a reconstruction network (RecNet) with a novel encoder-decoder-reconstructor architecture, which leverages both the forward (video to sentence) and backward (sentence to video) flows for video captioning. Specifically, the encoder-decoder makes use of the forward flow to produce the sentence description based on the encoded video semantic features. Two types of reconstructors are customized to employ the backward flow and reproduce the video features based on the hidden state sequence generated by the decoder. The generation loss yielded by the encoder-decoder and the reconstruction loss introduced by the reconstructor are jointly drawn into training the proposed RecNet in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed reconstructor can boost the encoder-decoder models and leads to significant gains in video caption accuracy. 
### 641.Regularizing RNNs for Caption Generation by Reconstructing The Past with  The Present [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11439.pdf)
> Recently, caption generation with an encoder-decoder framework has been extensively studied and applied in different domains, such as image captioning, code captioning, and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, namely Auto-Reconstructor Network (ARNet), which, coupling with the conventional encoder-decoder framework, works in an end-to-end fashion to generate captions. ARNet aims at reconstructing the previous hidden state with the present one, besides behaving as the input-dependent transition operator. Therefore, ARNet encourages the current hidden state to embed more information from the previous one, which can help regularize the transition dynamics of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Extensive experimental results show that our proposed ARNet boosts the performance over the existing encoder-decoder models on both image captioning and source code captioning tasks. Additionally, ARNet remarkably reduces the discrepancy between training and inference processes for caption generation. Furthermore, the performance on permuted sequential MNIST demonstrates that ARNet can effectively regularize RNN, especially on modeling long-term dependencies. Our code is available at: <a href="https://github.com/chenxinpeng/ARNet">this https URL</a> 
### 642.3D Pose Estimation and 3D Model Retrieval for Objects in the Wild [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11493.pdf)
> We propose a scalable, efficient and accurate approach to retrieve 3D models for objects in the wild. Our contribution is twofold. We first present a 3D pose estimation approach for object categories which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on Pascal3D+. Second, we use the estimated pose as a prior to retrieve 3D models which accurately represent the geometry of objects in RGB images. For this purpose, we render depth images from 3D models under our predicted pose and match learned image descriptors of RGB images against those of rendered depth images using a CNN-based multi-view metric learning approach. In this way, we are the first to report quantitative results for 3D model retrieval on Pascal3D+, where our method chooses the same models as human annotators for 50% of the validation images on average. In addition, we show that our method, which was trained purely on Pascal3D+, retrieves rich and accurate 3D models from ShapeNet given RGB images of objects in the wild. 
### 643.Predicting Future Instance Segmentations by Forecasting Convolutional  Features [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11496.pdf)
> Anticipating future events is an important prerequisite towards intelligent behavior. Video forecasting has been studied as a proxy task towards this goal. Recent work has shown that to predict semantic segmentation of future frames, forecasting at the semantic level is more effective than forecasting RGB frames and then segmenting these. In this paper we consider the more challenging problem of future instance segmentation, which additionally segments out individual objects. To deal with a varying number of output labels per image, we develop a predictive model in the space of fixed-sized convolutional features of the Mask R-CNN instance segmentation model. We apply the "detection head" of Mask R-CNN on the predicted features to produce the instance segmentation of future frames. Experiments show that this approach significantly improves over baselines based on optical flow. 
### 644.SpiderCNN: Deep Learning on Point Sets with Parameterized Convolutional  Filters [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11527.pdf)
> Deep neural networks have enjoyed remarkable success for various vision tasks, however it remains challenging to apply CNNs to domains lacking a regular underlying structures such as 3D point clouds. Towards this we propose a novel convolutional architecture, termed SpiderCNN, to efficiently extract geometric features from point clouds. SpiderCNN is comprised of units called SpiderConv, which extend convolutional operations from regular grids to irregular point sets that can be embedded in R^n, by parametrizing a family of convolutional filters. We design the filter as a product of a simple step function that captures local geodesic information and a Taylor polynomial that ensures the expressiveness. SpiderCNN inherits the multi-scale hierarchical architecture from classical CNNs, which allows it to extract semantic deep features. Experiments on ModelNet40 demonstrate that SpiderCNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy 92.4% on standard benchmarks, and shows competitive performance on segmentation task. 
### 645.Guide Me: Interacting with Deep Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11544.pdf)
> Interaction and collaboration between humans and intelligent machines has become increasingly important as machine learning methods move into real-world applications that involve end users. While much prior work lies at the intersection of natural language and vision, such as image captioning or image generation from text descriptions, less focus has been placed on the use of language to guide or improve the performance of a learned visual processing algorithm. In this paper, we explore methods to flexibly guide a trained convolutional neural network through user input to improve its performance during inference. We do so by inserting a layer that acts as a spatio-semantic guide into the network. This guide is trained to modify the network's activations, either directly via an energy minimization scheme or indirectly through a recurrent model that translates human language queries to interaction weights. Learning the verbal interaction is fully automatic and does not require manual text annotations. We evaluate the method on two datasets, showing that guiding a pre-trained network can improve performance, and provide extensive insights into the interaction between the guide and the CNN. 
### 646.Multi-modal Disease Classification in Incomplete Datasets Using  Geometric Matrix Completion [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11550.pdf)
> In large population-based studies and in clinical routine, tasks like disease diagnosis and progression prediction are inherently based on a rich set of multi-modal data, including imaging and other sensor data, clinical scores, phenotypes, labels and demographics. However, missing features, rater bias and inaccurate measurements are typical ailments of real-life medical datasets. Recently, it has been shown that deep learning with graph convolution neural networks (GCN) can outperform traditional machine learning in disease classification, but missing features remain an open problem. In this work, we follow up on the idea of modeling multi-modal disease classification as a matrix completion problem, with simultaneous classification and non-linear imputation of features. Compared to methods before, we arrange subjects in a graph-structure and solve classification through geometric matrix completion, which simulates a heat diffusion process that is learned and solved with a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate the potential of this method on the ADNI-based TADPOLE dataset and on the task of predicting the transition from MCI to Alzheimer's disease. With an AUC of 0.950 and classification accuracy of 87%, our approach outperforms standard linear and non-linear classifiers, as well as several state-of-the-art results in related literature, including a recently proposed GCN-based approach. 
### 647.Learning to Anonymize Faces for Privacy Preserving Action Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11556.pdf)
> There is an increasing concern in computer vision devices invading users' privacy by recording unwanted videos. On the one hand, we want the camera systems to recognize important events and assist human daily lives by understanding its videos, but on the other hand we want to ensure that they do not intrude people's privacy. In this paper, we propose a new principled approach for learning a video \emph{face anonymizer}. We use an adversarial training setting in which two competing systems fight: (1) a video anonymizer that modifies the original video to remove privacy-sensitive information while still trying to maximize spatial action detection performance, and (2) a discriminator that tries to extract privacy-sensitive information from the anonymized videos. The end result is a video anonymizer that performs pixel-level modifications to anonymize each person's face, with minimal effect on action detection performance. We experimentally confirm the benefits of our approach compared to conventional hand-crafted anonymization methods including masking, blurring, and noise adding. Code, demo, and more results can be found on our project page <a href="https://jason718.github.io/project/privacy/main.html.">this https URL</a> 
### 648.Neural Networks Should Be Wide Enough to Learn Disconnected Decision  Regions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00094.pdf)
> In the recent literature the important role of depth in deep learning has been emphasized. In this paper we argue that sufficient width of a feedforward network is equally important by answering the simple question under which conditions the decision regions of a neural network are connected. It turns out that for a class of activation functions including leaky ReLU, neural networks having a pyramidal structure, that is no layer has more hidden units than the input dimension, produce necessarily connected decision regions. This implies that a sufficiently wide hidden layer is necessary to guarantee that the network can produce disconnected decision regions. We discuss the implications of this result for the construction of neural networks, in particular the relation to the problem of adversarial manipulation of classifiers. 
### 649.A Deep Learning Approach for Multimodal Deception Detection [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00344.pdf)
> Automatic deception detection is an important task that has gained momentum in computational linguistics due to its potential applications. In this paper, we propose a simple yet tough to beat multi-modal neural model for deception detection. By combining features from different modalities such as video, audio, and text along with Micro-Expression features, we show that detecting deception in real life videos can be more accurate. Experimental results on a dataset of real-life deception videos show that our model outperforms existing techniques for deception detection with an accuracy of 96.14% and ROC-AUC of 0.9799. 
### 650.Knowledge Transfer with Jacobian Matching [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00443.pdf)
> Classical distillation methods transfer representations from a "teacher" neural network to a "student" network by matching their output activations. Recent methods also match the Jacobians, or the gradient of output activations with the input. However, this involves making some ad hoc decisions, in particular, the choice of the loss function. <br />In this paper, we first establish an equivalence between Jacobian matching and distillation with input noise, from which we derive appropriate loss functions for Jacobian matching. We then rely on this analysis to apply Jacobian matching to transfer learning by establishing equivalence of a recent transfer learning procedure to distillation. <br />We then show experimentally on standard image datasets that Jacobian-based penalties improve distillation, robustness to noisy inputs, and transfer learning. 
### 651.Semi-parametric Topological Memory for Navigation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00653.pdf)
> We introduce a new memory architecture for navigation in previously unseen environments, inspired by landmark-based navigation in animals. The proposed semi-parametric topological memory (SPTM) consists of a (non-parametric) graph with nodes corresponding to locations in the environment and a (parametric) deep network capable of retrieving nodes from the graph based on observations. The graph stores no metric information, only connectivity of locations corresponding to the nodes. We use SPTM as a planning module in a navigation system. Given only 5 minutes of footage of a previously unseen maze, an SPTM-based navigation agent can build a topological map of the environment and use it to confidently navigate towards goals. The average success rate of the SPTM agent in goal-directed navigation across test environments is higher than the best-performing baseline by a factor of three. A video of the agent is available at <a href="https://youtu.be/vRF7f4lhswo">this https URL</a> 
### 652.Meta-Learning for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00676.pdf)
> In few-shot classification, we are interested in learning algorithms that train a classifier from only a handful of labeled examples. Recent progress in few-shot classification has featured meta-learning, in which a parameterized model for a learning algorithm is defined and trained on episodes representing different classification problems, each with a small labeled training set and its corresponding test set. In this work, we advance this few-shot classification paradigm towards a scenario where unlabeled examples are also available within each episode. We consider two situations: one where all unlabeled examples are assumed to belong to the same set of classes as the labeled examples of the episode, as well as the more challenging situation where examples from other distractor classes are also provided. To address this paradigm, we propose novel extensions of Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) that are augmented with the ability to use unlabeled examples when producing prototypes. These models are trained in an end-to-end way on episodes, to learn to leverage the unlabeled examples successfully. We evaluate these methods on versions of the Omniglot and miniImageNet benchmarks, adapted to this new framework augmented with unlabeled examples. We also propose a new split of ImageNet, consisting of a large set of classes, with a hierarchical structure. Our experiments confirm that our Prototypical Networks can learn to improve their predictions due to unlabeled examples, much like a semi-supervised algorithm would. 
### 653.Raw Multi-Channel Audio Source Separation using Multi-Resolution  Convolutional Auto-Encoders [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00702.pdf)
> Supervised multi-channel audio source separation requires extracting useful spectral, temporal, and spatial features from the mixed signals. The success of many existing systems is therefore largely dependent on the choice of features used for training. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-channel, multi-resolution convolutional auto-encoder neural network that works on raw time-domain signals to determine appropriate multi-resolution features for separating the singing-voice from stereo music. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve multi-channel audio source separation without the need for hand-crafted features or any pre- or post-processing. 
### 654.Deep Cocktail Network: Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with  Category Shift [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00830.pdf)
> Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) conventionally assumes labeled source samples coming from a single underlying source distribution. Whereas in practical scenario, labeled data are typically collected from diverse sources. The multiple sources are different not only from the target but also from each other, thus, domain adaptater should not be modeled in the same way. Moreover, those sources may not completely share their categories, which further brings a new transfer challenge called category shift. In this paper, we propose a deep cocktail network (DCTN) to battle the domain and category shifts among multiple sources. Motivated by the theoretical results in \cite{mansour2009domain}, the target distribution can be represented as the weighted combination of source distributions, and, the multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation via DCTN is then performed as two alternating steps: i) It deploys multi-way adversarial learning to minimize the discrepancy between the target and each of the multiple source domains, which also obtains the source-specific perplexity scores to denote the possibilities that a target sample belongs to different source domains. ii) The multi-source category classifiers are integrated with the perplexity scores to classify target sample, and the pseudo-labeled target samples together with source samples are utilized to update the multi-source category classifier and the feature extractor. We evaluate DCTN in three domain adaptation benchmarks, which clearly demonstrate the superiority of our framework. 
### 655.Chest X-Ray Analysis of Tuberculosis by Deep Learning with Segmentation  and Augmentation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01199.pdf)
> The results of chest X-ray (CXR) analysis of 2D images to get the statistically reliable predictions (availability of tuberculosis) by computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) on the basis of deep learning are presented. They demonstrate the efficiency of lung segmentation, lossless and lossy data augmentation for CADx of tuberculosis by deep convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to the small and not well-balanced dataset even. CNN demonstrates ability to train (despite overfitting) on the pre-processed dataset obtained after lung segmentation in contrast to the original not-segmented dataset. Lossless data augmentation of the segmented dataset leads to the lowest validation loss (without overfitting) and nearly the same accuracy (within the limits of standard deviation) in comparison to the original and other pre-processed datasets after lossy data augmentation. The additional limited lossy data augmentation results in the lower validation loss, but with a decrease of the validation accuracy. In conclusion, besides the more complex deep CNNs and bigger datasets, the better progress of CADx for the small and not well-balanced datasets even could be obtained by better segmentation, data augmentation, dataset stratification, and exclusion of non-evident outliers. 
### 656.Deep Bayesian Active Semi-Supervised Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01216.pdf)
> In many applications the process of generating label information is expensive and time consuming. We present a new method that combines active and semi-supervised deep learning to achieve high generalization performance from a deep convolutional neural network with as few known labels as possible. In a setting where a small amount of labeled data as well as a large amount of unlabeled data is available, our method first learns the labeled data set. This initialization is followed by an expectation maximization algorithm, where further training reduces classification entropy on the unlabeled data by targeting a low entropy fit which is consistent with the labeled data. In addition the algorithm asks at a specified frequency an oracle for labels of data with entropy above a certain entropy quantile. Using this active learning component we obtain an agile labeling process that achieves high accuracy, but requires only a small amount of known labels. For the MNIST dataset we report an error rate of 2.06% using only 300 labels and 1.06% for 1000 labels. These results are obtained without employing any special network architecture or data augmentation. 
### 657.Deep Continuous Clustering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01449.pdf)
> Clustering high-dimensional datasets is hard because interpoint distances become less informative in high-dimensional spaces. We present a clustering algorithm that performs nonlinear dimensionality reduction and clustering jointly. The data is embedded into a lower-dimensional space by a deep autoencoder. The autoencoder is optimized as part of the clustering process. The resulting network produces clustered data. The presented approach does not rely on prior knowledge of the number of ground-truth clusters. Joint nonlinear dimensionality reduction and clustering are formulated as optimization of a global continuous objective. We thus avoid discrete reconfigurations of the objective that characterize prior clustering algorithms. Experiments on datasets from multiple domains demonstrate that the presented algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art clustering schemes, including recent methods that use deep networks. 
### 658.Occupancy Map Prediction Using Generative and Fully Convolutional  Networks for Vehicle Navigation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02007.pdf)
> Fast, collision-free motion through unknown environments remains a challenging problem for robotic systems. In these situations, the robot's ability to reason about its future motion is often severely limited by sensor field of view (FOV). By contrast, biological systems routinely make decisions by taking into consideration what might exist beyond their FOV based on prior experience. In this paper, we present an approach for predicting occupancy map representations of sensor data for future robot motions using deep neural networks. We evaluate several deep network architectures, including purely generative and adversarial models. Testing on both simulated and real environments we demonstrated performance both qualitatively and quantitatively, with SSIM similarity measure up to 0.899. We showed that it is possible to make predictions about occupied space beyond the physical robot's FOV from simulated training data. In the future, this method will allow robots to navigate through unknown environments in a faster, safer manner.

> Accurate localization of other traffic participants is a vital task in autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art systems employ a combination of sensing modalities such as RGB cameras and LiDARs for localizing traffic participants, but most such demonstrations have been confined to plain roads. We demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first results for monocular object localization and shape estimation on surfaces that do not share the same plane with the moving monocular camera. We approximate road surfaces by local planar patches and use semantic cues from vehicles in the scene to initialize a local bundle-adjustment like procedure that simultaneously estimates the pose and shape of the vehicles, and the orientation of the local ground plane on which the vehicle stands as well. We evaluate the proposed approach on the KITTI and SYNTHIA-SF benchmarks, for a variety of road plane configurations. The proposed approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art for monocular object localization on arbitrarily-shaped roads. 
### 660.Where is my Device? - Detecting the Smart Device&#x27;s Wearing Location in  the Context of Active Safety for Vulnerable Road Users [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02097.pdf)
> This article describes an approach to detect the wearing location of smart devices worn by pedestrians and cyclists. The detection, which is based solely on the sensors of the smart devices, is important context-information which can be used to parametrize subsequent algorithms, e.g. for dead reckoning or intention detection to improve the safety of vulnerable road users. The wearing location recognition can in terms of Organic Computing (OC) be seen as a step towards self-awareness and self-adaptation. For the wearing location detection a two-stage process is presented. It is subdivided into moving detection followed by the wearing location classification. Finally, the approach is evaluated on a real world dataset consisting of pedestrians and cyclists. 
### 661.Fully Convolutional Grasp Detection Network with Oriented Anchor Box [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02209.pdf)
> In this paper, we present a real-time approach to predict multiple grasping poses for a parallel-plate robotic gripper using RGB images. A model with oriented anchor box mechanism is proposed and a new matching strategy is used during the training process. An end-to-end fully convolutional neural network is employed in our work. The network consists of two parts: the feature extractor and multi-grasp predictor. The feature extractor is a deep convolutional neural network. The multi-grasp predictor regresses grasp rectangles from predefined oriented rectangles, called oriented anchor boxes, and classifies the rectangles into graspable and ungraspable. On the standard Cornell Grasp Dataset, our model achieves an accuracy of 97.74% and 96.61% on image-wise split and object-wise split respectively, and outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approach by 1.74% on image-wise split and 0.51% on object-wise split. 
### 662.Multi-class Active Learning: A Hybrid Informative and Representative  Criterion Inspired Approach [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02222.pdf)
> Labeling each instance in a large dataset is extremely labor- and time- consuming . One way to alleviate this problem is active learning, which aims to which discover the most valuable instances for labeling to construct a powerful classifier. Considering both informativeness and representativeness provides a promising way to design a practical active learning. However, most existing active learning methods select instances favoring either informativeness or representativeness. Meanwhile, many are designed based on the binary class, so that they may present suboptimal solutions on the datasets with multiple classes. In this paper, a hybrid informative and representative criterion based multi-class active learning approach is proposed. We combine the informative informativeness and representativeness into one formula, which can be solved under a unified framework. The informativeness is measured by the margin minimum while the representative information is measured by the maximum mean discrepancy. By minimizing the upper bound for the true risk, we generalize the empirical risk minimization principle to the active learning setting. Simultaneously, our proposed method makes full use of the label information, and the proposed active learning is designed based on multiple classes. So the proposed method is not suitable to the binary class but also the multiple classes. We conduct our experiments on twelve benchmark UCI data sets, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than some state-of-the-art methods. 
### 663.Learning monocular visual odometry with dense 3D mapping from dense 3D  flow [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02286.pdf)
> This paper introduces a fully deep learning approach to monocular SLAM, which can perform simultaneous localization using a neural network for learning visual odometry (L-VO) and dense 3D mapping. Dense 2D flow and a depth image are generated from monocular images by sub-networks, which are then used by a 3D flow associated layer in the L-VO network to generate dense 3D flow. Given this 3D flow, the dual-stream L-VO network can then predict the 6DOF relative pose and furthermore reconstruct the vehicle trajectory. In order to learn the correlation between motion directions, the Bivariate Gaussian modelling is employed in the loss function. The L-VO network achieves an overall performance of 2.68% for average translational error and 0.0143 deg/m for average rotational error on the KITTI odometry benchmark. Moreover, the learned depth is fully leveraged to generate a dense 3D map. As a result, an entire visual SLAM system, that is, learning monocular odometry combined with dense 3D mapping, is achieved. 
### 664.TRLG: Fragile blind quad watermarking for image tamper detection and  recovery by providing compact digests with quality optimized using LWT and GA [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02623.pdf)
> In this paper, an efficient fragile blind quad watermarking scheme for image tamper detection and recovery based on lifting wavelet transform and genetic algorithm is proposed. TRLG generates four compact digests with super quality based on lifting wavelet transform and halftoning technique by distinguishing the types of image blocks. In other words, for each 2*2 non-overlap blocks, four chances for recovering destroyed blocks are considered. A special parameter estimation technique based on genetic algorithm is performed to improve and optimize the quality of digests and watermarked image. Furthermore, CCS map is used to determine the mapping block for embedding information, encrypting and confusing the embedded information. In order to improve the recovery rate, Mirror-aside and Partner-block are proposed. The experiments that have been conducted to evaluate the performance of TRLG proved the superiority in terms of quality of the watermarked and recovered image, tamper localization and security compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results indicate that the PSNR and SSIM of the watermarked image are about 46 dB and approximately one, respectively. Also, the mean of PSNR and SSIM of several recovered images which has been destroyed about 90% is reached to 24 dB and 0.86, respectively. 
### 665.Applicability and interpretation of the deterministic weighted cepstral  distance [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03104.pdf)
> Quantifying similarity between data objects is an important part of modern data science. Deciding what similarity measure to use is very application dependent. In this paper, we combine insights from systems theory and machine learning, and investigate the weighted cepstral distance, which was previously defined for signals coming from ARMA models. We provide an extension of this distance to invertible deterministic linear time invariant single input single output models, and assess its applicability. We show that it can always be interpreted in terms of the poles and zeros of the underlying model, and that, in the case of stable, minimum-phase, or unstable, maximum-phase models, a geometrical interpretation in terms of subspace angles can be given. We then devise a method to assess stability and phase-type of the generating models, using only input/output signal information. In this way, we prove a connection between the extended weighted cepstral distance and a weighted cepstral model norm. In this way, we provide a purely data-driven way to assess different underlying dynamics of input/output signal pairs, without the need for any system identification step. This can be useful in machine learning tasks such as time series clustering. An iPython tutorial is published complementary to this paper, containing implementations of the various methods and algorithms presented here, as well as some numerical illustrations of the equivalences proven here. 
### 666.Towards Knowledge Discovery from the Vatican Secret Archives. In Codice  Ratio -- Episode 1: Machine Transcription of the Manuscripts [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03200.pdf)
> In Codice Ratio is a research project to study tools and techniques for analyzing the contents of historical documents conserved in the Vatican Secret Archives (VSA). In this paper, we present our efforts to develop a system to support the transcription of medieval manuscripts. The goal is to provide paleographers with a tool to reduce their efforts in transcribing large volumes, as those stored in the VSA, producing good transcriptions for significant portions of the manuscripts. We propose an original approach based on character segmentation. Our solution is able to deal with the dirty segmentation that inevitably occurs in handwritten documents. We use a convolutional neural network to recognize characters and language models to compose word transcriptions. Our approach requires minimal training efforts, making the transcription process more scalable as the production of training sets requires a few pages and can be easily crowdsourced. We have conducted experiments on manuscripts from the Vatican Registers, an unreleased corpus containing the correspondence of the popes. With training data produced by 120 high school students, our system has been able to produce good transcriptions that can be used by paleographers as a solid basis to speedup the transcription process at a large scale. 
### 667.GONet: A Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Approach For Traversability  Estimation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03254.pdf)
> We present semi-supervised deep learning approaches for traversability estimation from fisheye images. Our method, GONet, and the proposed extensions leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively predict whether the area seen in the input image(s) is safe for a robot to traverse. These methods are trained with many positive images of traversable places, but just a small set of negative images depicting blocked and unsafe areas. This makes the proposed methods practical. Positive examples can be collected easily by simply operating a robot through traversable spaces, while obtaining negative examples is time consuming, costly, and potentially dangerous. Through extensive experiments and several demonstrations, we show that the proposed traversability estimation approaches are robust and can generalize to unseen scenarios. Further, we demonstrate that our methods are memory efficient and fast, allowing for real-time operation on a mobile robot with single or stereo fisheye cameras. As part of our contributions, we open-source two new datasets for traversability estimation. These datasets are composed of approximately 24h of videos from more than 25 indoor environments. Our methods outperform baseline approaches for traversability estimation on these new datasets. 
### 668.Face2Text: Collecting an Annotated Image Description Corpus for the  Generation of Rich Face Descriptions [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03827.pdf)
> The past few years have witnessed renewed interest in NLP tasks at the interface between vision and language. One intensively-studied problem is that of automatically generating text from images. In this paper, we extend this problem to the more specific domain of face description. Unlike scene descriptions, face descriptions are more fine-grained and rely on attributes extracted from the image, rather than objects and relations. Given that no data exists for this task, we present an ongoing crowdsourcing study to collect a corpus of descriptions of face images taken `in the wild'. To gain a better understanding of the variation we find in face description and the possible issues that this may raise, we also conducted an annotation study on a subset of the corpus. Primarily, we found descriptions to refer to a mixture of attributes, not only physical, but also emotional and inferential, which is bound to create further challenges for current image-to-text methods. 
### 669.Revisiting Decomposable Submodular Function Minimization with Incidence  Relations [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03851.pdf)
> We introduce a new approach to decomposable submodular function minimization (DSFM) that exploits incidence relations. Incidence relations describe which variables effectively influence the component functions, and when properly utilized, they allow for improving the convergence rates of DSFM solvers. Our main results include the precise parametrization of the DSFM problem based on incidence relations, the development of new scalable alternative projections and parallel coordinate descent methods and an accompanying rigorous analysis of their convergence rates. 
### 670.Learning Local Distortion Visibility From Image Quality Data-sets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04053.pdf)
> Accurate prediction of local distortion visibility thresholds is critical in many image and video processing applications. Existing methods require an accurate modeling of the human visual system, and are derived through pshycophysical experiments with simple, artificial stimuli. These approaches, however, are difficult to generalize to natural images with complex types of distortion. In this paper, we explore a different perspective, and we investigate whether it is possible to learn local distortion visibility from image quality scores. We propose a convolutional neural network based optimization framework to infer local detection thresholds in a distorted image. Our model is trained on multiple quality datasets, and the results are correlated with empirical visibility thresholds collected on complex stimuli in a recent study. Our results are comparable to state-of-the-art mathematical models that were trained on phsycovisual data directly. This suggests that it is possible to predict psychophysical phenomena from visibility information embedded in image quality scores. 
### 671.A state of the art of urban reconstruction: street, street network,  vegetation, urban feature [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04332.pdf)
> World population is raising, especially the part of people living in cities. With increased population and complex roles regarding their inhabitants and their surroundings, cities concentrate difficulties for design, planning and analysis. These tasks require a way to reconstruct/model a city. Traditionally, much attention has been given to buildings reconstruction, yet an essential part of city were neglected: streets. Streets reconstruction has been seldom researched. Streets are also complex compositions of urban features, and have a unique role for transportation (as they comprise roads). We aim at completing the recent state of the art for building reconstruction (Musialski2012) by considering all other aspect of urban reconstruction. We introduce the need for city models. Because reconstruction always necessitates data, we first analyse which data are available. We then expose a state of the art of street reconstruction, street network reconstruction, urban features reconstruction/modelling, vegetation , and urban objects reconstruction/modelling. <br />Although reconstruction strategies vary widely, we can order them by the role the model plays, from data driven approach, to model-based approach, to inverse procedural modelling and model catalogue matching. The main challenges seems to come from the complex nature of urban environment and from the limitations of the available data. Urban features have strong relationships, between them, and to their surrounding, as well as in hierarchical relations. Procedural modelling has the power to express these relations, and could be applied to the reconstruction of urban features via the Inverse Procedural Modelling paradigm. 
### 672.Clustering with Simultaneous Local and Global View of Data: A message  passing based approach [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04459.pdf)
> A good clustering algorithm should not only be able to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes (global view) but also provide additional information, which can be used to gain more meaningful insights into the internal structure of the clusters (local view). In this work we use the mathematical framework of factor graphs and message passing algorithms to optimize a pairwise similarity based cost function, in the same spirit as was done in Affinity Propagation. Using this framework we develop two variants of a new clustering algorithm, EAP and SHAPE. EAP/SHAPE can not only discover clusters of arbitrary shapes but also provide a rich local view in the form of meaningful local representatives (exemplars) and connections between these local exemplars. We discuss how this local information can be used to gain various insights about the clusters including varying relative cluster densities and indication of local strength in different regions of a cluster . We also discuss how this can help an analyst in discovering and resolving potential inconsistencies in the results. The efficacy of EAP/SHAPE is shown by applying it to various synthetic and real world benchmark datasets. 
### 673.Testing Deep Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04792.pdf)
> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have a wide range of applications, and software employing them must be thoroughly tested, especially in safety critical domains. However, traditional software testing methodology, including test coverage criteria and test case generation algorithms, cannot be applied directly to DNNs. This paper bridges this gap. First, inspired by the traditional MC/DC coverage criterion, we propose a set of four test criteria that are tailored to the distinct features of DNNs. Our novel criteria are incomparable and complement each other. Second, for each criterion, we give an algorithm for generating test cases based on linear programming (LP). The algorithms produce a new test case (i.e., an input to the DNN) by perturbing a given one. They encode the test requirement and a fragment of the DNN by fixing the activation pattern obtained from the given input example, and then minimize the difference between the new and the current inputs. Finally, we validate our method on a set of networks trained on the MNIST dataset. The utility of our method is shown experimentally with four objectives: (1) bug finding; (2) DNN safety statistics; (3) testing efficiency and (4) DNN internal structure analysis. 
### 674.Onion-Peeling Outlier Detection in 2-D data Sets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04964.pdf)
> Outlier Detection is a critical and cardinal research task due its array of applications in variety of domains ranging from data mining, clustering, statistical analysis, fraud detection, network intrusion detection and diagnosis of diseases etc. Over the last few decades, distance-based outlier detection algorithms have gained significant reputation as a viable alternative to the more traditional statistical approaches due to their scalable, non-parametric and simple implementation. In this paper, we present a modified onion peeling (Convex hull) genetic algorithm to detect outliers in a Gaussian 2-D point data set. We present three different scenarios of outlier detection using a) Euclidean Distance Metric b) Standardized Euclidean Distance Metric and c) Mahalanobis Distance Metric. Finally, we analyze the performance and evaluate the results. 
### 675.A Probabilistic Disease Progression Model for Predicting Future Clinical  Outcome [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05011.pdf)
> In this work, we consider the problem of predicting the course of a progressive disease, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Progressive diseases often start with mild symptoms that might precede a diagnosis, and each patient follows their own trajectory. Patient trajectories exhibit wild variability, which can be associated with many factors such as genotype, age, or sex. An additional layer of complexity is that, in real life, the amount and type of data available for each patient can differ significantly. For example, for one patient we might have no prior history, whereas for another patient we might have detailed clinical assessments obtained at multiple prior time-points. This paper presents a probabilistic model that can handle multiple modalities (including images and clinical assessments) and variable patient histories with irregular timings and missing entries, to predict clinical scores at future time-points. We use a sigmoidal function to model latent disease progression, which gives rise to clinical observations in our generative model. We implemented an approximate Bayesian inference strategy on the proposed model to estimate the parameters on data from a large population of subjects. Furthermore, the Bayesian framework enables the model to automatically fine-tune its predictions based on historical observations that might be available on the test subject. We applied our method to a longitudinal Alzheimer's disease dataset with more than 3000 subjects [23] and present a detailed empirical analysis of prediction performance under different scenarios, with comparisons against several benchmarks. We also demonstrate how the proposed model can be interrogated to glean insights about temporal dynamics in Alzheimer's disease. 
### 676.Principal Component Analysis with Tensor Train Subspace [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05026.pdf)
> Tensor train is a hierarchical tensor network structure that helps alleviate the curse of dimensionality by parameterizing large-scale multidimensional data via a set of network of low-rank tensors. Associated with such a construction is a notion of Tensor Train subspace and in this paper we propose a TT-PCA algorithm for estimating this structured subspace from the given data. By maintaining low rank tensor structure, TT-PCA is more robust to noise comparing with PCA or Tucker-PCA. This is borne out numerically by testing the proposed approach on the Extended YaleFace Dataset B. 
### 677.Averaging Weights Leads to Wider Optima and Better Generalization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05407.pdf)
> Deep neural networks are typically trained by optimizing a loss function with an SGD variant, in conjunction with a decaying learning rate, until convergence. We show that simple averaging of multiple points along the trajectory of SGD, with a cyclical or constant learning rate, leads to better generalization than conventional training. We also show that this Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) procedure finds much broader optima than SGD, and approximates the recent Fast Geometric Ensembling (FGE) approach with a single model. Using SWA we achieve notable improvement in test accuracy over conventional SGD training on a range of state-of-the-art residual networks, PyramidNets, DenseNets, and Shake-Shake networks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In short, SWA is extremely easy to implement, improves generalization, and has almost no computational overhead. 
### 678.Fast Subspace Clustering Based on the Kronecker Product [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05657.pdf)
> Subspace clustering is a useful technique for many computer vision applications in which the intrinsic dimension of high-dimensional data is often smaller than the ambient dimension. Spectral clustering, as one of the main approaches to subspace clustering, often takes on a sparse representation or a low-rank representation to learn a block diagonal self-representation matrix for subspace generation. However, existing methods require solving a large scale convex optimization problem with a large set of data, with computational complexity reaches O(N^3) for N data points. Therefore, the efficiency and scalability of traditional spectral clustering methods can not be guaranteed for large scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a subspace clustering model based on the Kronecker product. Due to the property that the Kronecker product of a block diagonal matrix with any other matrix is still a block diagonal matrix, we can efficiently learn the representation matrix which is formed by the Kronecker product of k smaller matrices. By doing so, our model significantly reduces the computational complexity to O(kN^{3/k}). Furthermore, our model is general in nature, and can be adapted to different regularization based subspace clustering methods. Experimental results on two public datasets show that our model significantly improves the efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we have conducted experiments on synthetic data to verify the scalability of our model for large scale datasets. 
### 679.A Dataset and Architecture for Visual Reasoning with a Working Memory [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06092.pdf)
> A vexing problem in artificial intelligence is reasoning about events that occur in complex, changing visual stimuli such as in video analysis or game play. Inspired by a rich tradition of visual reasoning and memory in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, we developed an artificial, configurable visual question and answer dataset (COG) to parallel experiments in humans and animals. COG is much simpler than the general problem of video analysis, yet it addresses many of the problems relating to visual and logical reasoning and memory -- problems that remain challenging for modern deep learning architectures. We additionally propose a deep learning architecture that performs competitively on other diagnostic VQA datasets (i.e. CLEVR) as well as easy settings of the COG dataset. However, several settings of COG result in datasets that are progressively more challenging to learn. After training, the network can zero-shot generalize to many new tasks. Preliminary analyses of the network architectures trained on COG demonstrate that the network accomplishes the task in a manner interpretable to humans. 
### 680.Consistent sets of lines with no colorful incidence [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06267.pdf)
> We consider incidences among colored sets of lines in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and examine whether the existence of certain concurrences between lines of $k$ colors force the existence of at least one concurrence between lines of $k+1$ colors. This question is relevant for problems in 3D reconstruction in computer vision. 
### 681.Deep Component Analysis via Alternating Direction Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06407.pdf)
> Despite a lack of theoretical understanding, deep neural networks have achieved unparalleled performance in a wide range of applications. On the other hand, shallow representation learning with component analysis is associated with rich intuition and theory, but smaller capacity often limits its usefulness. To bridge this gap, we introduce Deep Component Analysis (DeepCA), an expressive multilayer model formulation that enforces hierarchical structure through constraints on latent variables in each layer. For inference, we propose a differentiable optimization algorithm implemented using recurrent Alternating Direction Neural Networks (ADNNs) that enable parameter learning using standard backpropagation. By interpreting feed-forward networks as single-iteration approximations of inference in our model, we provide both a novel theoretical perspective for understanding them and a practical technique for constraining predictions with prior knowledge. Experimentally, we demonstrate performance improvements on a variety of tasks, including single-image depth prediction with sparse output constraints. 
### 682.Constrained Deep Learning using Conditional Gradient and Applications in  Computer Vision [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06453.pdf)
> A number of results have recently demonstrated the benefits of incorporating various constraints when training deep architectures in vision and machine learning. The advantages range from guarantees for statistical generalization to better accuracy to compression. But support for general constraints within widely used libraries remains scarce and their broader deployment within many applications that can benefit from them remains under-explored. Part of the reason is that Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the workhorse for training deep neural networks, does not natively deal with constraints with global scope very well. In this paper, we revisit a classical first order scheme from numerical optimization, Conditional Gradients (CG), that has, thus far had limited applicability in training deep models. We show via rigorous analysis how various constraints can be naturally handled by modifications of this algorithm. We provide convergence guarantees and show a suite of immediate benefits that are possible -- from training ResNets with fewer layers but better accuracy simply by substituting in our version of CG to faster training of GANs with 50% fewer epochs in image inpainting applications to provably better generalization guarantees using efficiently implementable forms of recently proposed regularizers. 
### 683.Evolving Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Variable-length Particle  Swarm Optimization for Image Classification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06492.pdf)
> Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of the most effective deep learning methods to solve image classification problems, but the best architecture of a CNN to solve a specific problem can be extremely complicated and hard to design. This paper focuses on utilising Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) to automatically search for the optimal architecture of CNNs without any manual work involved. In order to achieve the goal, three improvements are made based on traditional PSO. First, a novel encoding strategy inspired by computer networks which empowers particle vectors to easily encode CNN layers is proposed; Second, in order to allow the proposed method to learn variable-length CNN architectures, a Disabled layer is designed to hide some dimensions of the particle vector to achieve variable-length particles; Third, since the learning process on large data is slow, partial datasets are randomly picked for the evaluation to dramatically speed it up. The proposed algorithm is examined and compared with 12 existing algorithms including the state-of-art methods on three widely used image classification benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is a strong competitor to the state-of-art algorithms in terms of classification error. This is the first work using PSO for automatically evolving the architectures of CNNs. 
### 684.Neural Architecture Construction using EnvelopeNets [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06744.pdf)
> In recent years, several automated search methods for neural network architectures have been proposed using methods such as evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning. These methods use an objective function (usually accuracy) that is evaluated after a full training and evaluation cycle. We show that statistics derived from filter featuremaps reach a state where the utility of different filters within a network can be compared and hence can be used to construct networks. The training epochs needed for filters within a network to reach this state is much less than the training epochs needed for the accuracy of a network to stabilize. EnvelopeNets is a construction method that exploits this finding to design convolutional neural nets (CNNs) in a fraction of the time needed by conventional search methods. The constructed networks show close to state of the art performance on the image classification problem on well known datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and consistently show better performance than hand constructed and randomly generated networks of the same depth, operators and approximately the same number of parameters. 
### 685.Asymmetric kernel in Gaussian Processes for learning target variance [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06952.pdf)
> This work incorporates the multi-modality of the data distribution into a Gaussian Process regression model. We approach the problem from a discriminative perspective by learning, jointly over the training data, the target space variance in the neighborhood of a certain sample through metric learning. We start by using data centers rather than all training samples. Subsequently, each center selects an individualized kernel metric. This enables each center to adjust the kernel space in its vicinity in correspondence with the topology of the targets --- a multi-modal approach. We additionally add descriptiveness by allowing each center to learn a precision matrix. We demonstrate empirically the reliability of the model. 
### 686.A Distance Oriented Kalman Filter Particle Swarm Optimizer Applied to  Multi-Modality Image Registration [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07423.pdf)
> In this paper we describe improvements to the particle swarm optimizer (PSO) made by inclusion of an unscented Kalman filter to guide particle motion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the unscented Kalman filter PSO by comparing it with the original PSO algorithm and its variants designed to improve performance. The PSOs were tested firstly on a number of common synthetic benchmarking functions, and secondly applied to a practical three-dimensional image registration problem. The proposed methods displayed better performances for 4 out of 8 benchmark functions, and reduced the target registration errors by at least 2mm when registering down-sampled benchmark brain images. Our methods also demonstrated an ability to align images featuring motion related artefacts which all other methods failed to register. These new PSO methods provide a novel, efficient mechanism to integrate prior knowledge into each iteration of the optimization process, which can enhance the accuracy and speed of convergence in the application of medical image registration. 
### 687.Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: Addressing Key Issues and Setting up  Baselines [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07427.pdf)
> Sentiment analysis is proven to be very useful tool in many applications regarding social media. This has led to a great surge of research in this field. Hence, in this paper, we compile the baselines for such research. In this paper, we explore three different deep-learning based architectures for multimodal sentiment classification, each improving upon the previous. Further, we evaluate these architectures with multiple datasets with fixed train/test partition. We also discuss some major issues, frequently ignored in multimodal sentiment analysis research, e.g., role of speaker-exclusive models, importance of different modalities, and generalizability. This framework illustrates the different facets of analysis to be considered while performing multimodal sentiment analysis and, hence, serves as a new benchmark for future research in this emerging field. We draw a comparison among the methods using empirical data, obtained from the experiments. In the future, we plan to focus on extracting semantics from visual features, cross-modal features and fusion. 
### 688.IntPhys: A Framework and Benchmark for Visual Intuitive Physics  Reasoning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07616.pdf)
> In order to reach human performance on complex visual tasks, artificial systems need to incorporate a significant amount of understanding of the world in terms of macroscopic objects, movements, forces, etc. Inspired by work on intuitive physics in infants, we propose an evaluation framework which diagnoses how much a given system understands about physics by testing whether it can tell apart well matched videos of possible versus impossible events. The test requires systems to compute a physical plausibility score over an entire video. It is free of bias and can test a range of specific physical reasoning skills. We then describe the first release of a benchmark dataset aimed at learning intuitive physics in an unsupervised way, using videos constructed with a game engine. We describe two Deep Neural Network baseline systems trained with a future frame prediction objective and tested on the possible versus impossible discrimination task. The analysis of their results compared to human data gives novel insights in the potentials and limitations of next frame prediction architectures. 
### 689.Attention on Attention: Architectures for Visual Question Answering  (VQA) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07724.pdf)
> Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an increasingly popular topic in deep learning research, requiring coordination of natural language processing and computer vision modules into a single architecture. We build upon the model which placed first in the VQA Challenge by developing thirteen new attention mechanisms and introducing a simplified classifier. We performed 300 GPU hours of extensive hyperparameter and architecture searches and were able to achieve an evaluation score of 64.78%, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art single model's validation score of 63.15%. 
### 690.Adversarial Defense based on Structure-to-Signal Autoencoders [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07994.pdf)
> Adversarial attack methods have demonstrated the fragility of deep neural networks. Their imperceptible perturbations are frequently able fool classifiers into potentially dangerous misclassifications. We propose a novel way to interpret adversarial perturbations in terms of the effective input signal that classifiers actually use. Based on this, we apply specially trained autoencoders, referred to as S2SNets, as defense mechanism. They follow a two-stage training scheme: first unsupervised, followed by a fine-tuning of the decoder, using gradients from an existing classifier. S2SNets induce a shift in the distribution of gradients propagated through them, stripping them from class-dependent signal. We analyze their robustness against several white-box and gray-box scenarios on the large ImageNet dataset. Our approach reaches comparable resilience in white-box attack scenarios as other state-of-the-art defenses in gray-box scenarios. We further analyze the relationships of AlexNet, VGG 16, ResNet 50 and Inception v3 in adversarial space, and found that VGG 16 is the easiest to fool, while perturbations from ResNet 50 are the most transferable. 
### 691.CalibNet: Self-Supervised Extrinsic Calibration using 3D Spatial  Transformer Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08181.pdf)
> 3D LiDARs and 2D cameras are increasingly being used alongside each other in sensor rigs for perception tasks. Before these sensors can be used to gather meaningful data, however, their extrinsics (and intrinsics) need to be accurately calibrated, as the performance of the sensor rig is extremely sensitive to these calibration parameters. A vast majority of existing calibration techniques require significant amounts of data and/or calibration targets and human effort, severely impacting their applicability in large-scale production systems. We address this gap with CalibNet: a self-supervised deep network capable of automatically estimating the 6-DoF rigid body transformation between a 3D LiDAR and a 2D camera in real-time. CalibNet alleviates the need for calibration targets, thereby resulting in significant savings in calibration efforts. During training, the network only takes as input a LiDAR point cloud, the corresponding monocular image, and the camera calibration matrix K. At train time, we do not impose direct supervision (i.e., we do not directly regress to the calibration parameters, for example). Instead, we train the network to predict calibration parameters that maximize the geometric and photometric consistency of the input images and point clouds. CalibNet learns to iteratively solve the underlying geometric problem and accurately predicts extrinsic calibration parameters for a wide range of mis-calibrations, without requiring retraining or domain adaptation.

### 692.Deep Learning using Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08375.pdf)
> We introduce the use of rectified linear units (ReLU) as the classification function in a deep neural network (DNN). Conventionally, ReLU is used as an activation function in DNNs, with Softmax function as their classification function. However, there have been several studies on using a classification function other than Softmax, and this study is an addition to those. We accomplish this by taking the activation of the penultimate layer $h_{n - 1}$ in a neural network, then multiply it by weight parameters $\theta$ to get the raw scores $o_{i}$. Afterwards, we threshold the raw scores $o_{i}$ by $0$, i.e. $f(o) = \max(0, o_{i})$, where $f(o)$ is the ReLU function. We provide class predictions $\hat{y}$ through argmax function, i.e. argmax $f(x)$. 
### 693.Incremental Color Quantization for Color-Vision-Deficient Observers  Using Mobile Gaming Data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08420.pdf)
> The sizes of compressed images depend on their spatial resolution (number of pixels) and on their color resolution (number of color quantization levels). We introduce DaltonQuant, a new color quantization technique for image compression that cloud services can apply to images destined for a specific user with known color vision deficiencies. DaltonQuant improves compression in a user-specific but reversible manner thereby improving a user's network bandwidth and data storage efficiency. DaltonQuant quantizes image data to account for user-specific color perception anomalies, using a new method for incremental color quantization based on a large corpus of color vision acuity data obtained from a popular mobile game. Servers that host images can revert DaltonQuant's image requantization and compression when those images must be transmitted to a different user, making the technique practical to deploy on a large scale. We evaluate DaltonQuant's compression performance on the Kodak PC reference image set and show that it improves compression by an additional 22%-29% over the state-of-the-art compressors TinyPNG and pngquant. 
### 694.Fictitious GAN: Training GANs with Historical Models [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08647.pdf)
> Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are powerful tools for learning generative models. In practice, the training may suffer from lack of convergence. GANs are commonly viewed as a two-player zero-sum game between two neural networks. Here, we leverage this game theoretic view to study the convergence behavior of the training process. Inspired by the fictitious play learning process, a novel training method, referred to as Fictitious GAN, is introduced. Fictitious GAN trains the deep neural networks using a mixture of historical models. Specifically, the discriminator (resp. generator) is updated according to the best-response to the mixture outputs from a sequence of previously trained generators (resp. discriminators). It is shown that Fictitious GAN can effectively resolve some convergence issues that cannot be resolved by the standard training approach. It is proved that asymptotically the average of the generator outputs has the same distribution as the data samples. 
### 695.Improving DNN Robustness to Adversarial Attacks using Jacobian  Regularization [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08680.pdf)
> Deep neural networks have lately shown tremendous performance in various applications including vision and speech processing tasks. However, alongside their ability to perform these tasks with such high accuracy, it has been shown that they are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks: a small change in the input would cause the network to err with high confidence. This phenomenon exposes an inherent fault in these networks and their ability to generalize well. For this reason, providing robustness to adversarial attacks is an important challenge in networks training, which has led to extensive research. In this work, we suggest a theoretically inspired novel approach to improve the networks' robustness. Our method applies regularization using the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian of the network, which is applied as post-processing, after regular training has finished. We demonstrate empirically that it leads to enhanced robustness results with a minimal change in the original network's accuracy. 
### 696.Speeding-up Object Detection Training for Robotics with FALKON [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08740.pdf)
> Latest deep learning methods for object detection provide remarkable performance, but have limits when used in robotic applications. One of the most relevant issues is the long training time, which is due to the large size and imbalance of the associated training sets, characterized by few positive and a large number of negative examples (i.e. background). Proposed approaches are based on end-to-end learning by back-propagation [22] or kernel methods trained with Hard Negatives Mining on top of deep features [8]. These solutions are effective, but prohibitively slow for on-line applications. In this paper we propose a novel pipeline for object detection that overcomes this problem and provides comparable performance, with a 60x training speedup. Our pipeline combines (i) the Region Proposal Network and the deep feature extractor from [22] to efficiently select candidate RoIs and encode them into powerful representations, with (ii) the FALKON [23] algorithm, a novel kernel-based method that allows fast training on large scale problems (millions of points). We address the size and imbalance of training data by exploiting the stochastic subsampling intrinsic into the method and a novel, fast, bootstrapping approach. We assess the effectiveness of the approach on a standard Computer Vision dataset (PASCAL VOC 2007 [5]) and demonstrate its applicability to a real robotic scenario with the iCubWorld Transformations [18] dataset. 
### 697.Comparing Generative Adversarial Network Techniques for Image Creation  and Modification [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09093.pdf)
> Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated to be successful at generating realistic real-world images. In this paper we compare various GAN techniques, both supervised and unsupervised. The effects on training stability of different objective functions are compared. We add an encoder to the network, making it possible to encode images to the latent space of the GAN. The generator, discriminator and encoder are parameterized by deep convolutional neural networks. For the discriminator network we experimented with using the novel Capsule Network, a state-of-the-art technique for detecting global features in images. Experiments are performed using a digit and face dataset, with various visualizations illustrating the results. The results show that using the encoder network it is possible to reconstruct images. With the conditional GAN we can alter visual attributes of generated or encoded images. The experiments with the Capsule Network as discriminator result in generated images of a lower quality, compared to a standard convolutional neural network. 
### 698.Scene Graph Parsing as Dependency Parsing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09189.pdf)
> In this paper, we study the problem of parsing structured knowledge graphs from textual descriptions. In particular, we consider the scene graph representation that considers objects together with their attributes and relations: this representation has been proved useful across a variety of vision and language applications. We begin by introducing an alternative but equivalent edge-centric view of scene graphs that connect to dependency parses. Together with a careful redesign of label and action space, we combine the two-stage pipeline used in prior work (generic dependency parsing followed by simple post-processing) into one, enabling end-to-end training. The scene graphs generated by our learned neural dependency parser achieve an F-score similarity of 49.67% to ground truth graphs on our evaluation set, surpassing best previous approaches by 5%. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned parser on image retrieval applications. 
### 699.P2P-NET: Bidirectional Point Displacement Net for Shape Transform [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09263.pdf)
> We introduce P2P-NET, a general-purpose deep neural network which learns geometric transformations between point-based shape representations from two domains, e.g., meso-skeletons and surfaces, partial and complete scans, etc. The architecture of the P2P-NET is that of a bi-directional point displacement network, which transforms a source point set to a target point set with the same cardinality, and vice versa, by applying point-wise displacement vectors learned from data. P2P-NET is trained on paired shapes from the source and target domains, but without relying on point-to-point correspondences between the source and target point sets. The training loss combines two uni-directional geometric losses, each enforcing a shape-wise similarity between the predicted and the target point sets, and a cross-regularization term to encourage consistency between displacement vectors going in opposite directions. We develop and present several different applications enabled by our general-purpose bidirectional P2P-NET to highlight the effectiveness, versatility, and potential of our network in solving a variety of point-based shape transformation problems. 
### 700.Generalized Hadamard-Product Fusion Operators for Visual Question  Answering [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09374.pdf)
> We propose a generalized class of multimodal fusion operators for the task of visual question answering (VQA). We identify generalizations of existing multimodal fusion operators based on the Hadamard product, and show that specific non-trivial instantiations of this generalized fusion operator exhibit superior performance in terms of OpenEnded accuracy on the VQA task. In particular, we introduce Nonlinearity Ensembling, Feature Gating, and post-fusion neural network layers as fusion operator components, culminating in an absolute percentage point improvement of $1.1\%$ on the VQA 2.0 test-dev set over baseline fusion operators, which use the same features as input. We use our findings as evidence that our generalized class of fusion operators could lead to the discovery of even superior task-specific operators when used as a search space in an architecture search over fusion operators. 
### 701.A Systematic Comparison of Deep Learning Architectures in an Autonomous  Vehicle [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09386.pdf)
> Self-driving technology is advancing rapidly, largely due to recent developments in deep learning algorithms. To date, however, there has been no systematic comparison of how different deep learning architectures perform at such tasks, or an attempt to determine a correlation between classification performance and performance in an actual vehicle. Here, we introduce the first controlled comparison of seven contemporary deep-learning architectures in an end-to-end autonomous driving task. We use a simple and affordable platform consisting of of an off-the-shelf, remotely operated vehicle, a GPU equipped computer and an indoor foam-rubber racetrack. We compare a fully-connected network, a 2-layer CNN, AlexNet, VGG-16, Inception-V3, ResNet-26, and LSTM and report the number of laps they are able to successfully complete without crashing while traversing an indoor racetrack under identical testing conditions. Based on these tests, AlexNet completed the most laps without crashing out of all networks, and ResNet-26 is the most 'efficient' architecture examined, with respect to the number of laps completed relative to the number of parameters. We also observe whether spatial, color, or temporal features - or some combination - are more important for such tasks. Finally, we show that validation loss/accuracy is not sufficiently indicative of the model's performance even when employed in a real vehicle with a simple task, emphasizing the need for greater accessibility to research platforms within the self-driving community. 
### 702.On the Limitation of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality for Characterizing  the Subspaces of Adversarial Examples [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09638.pdf)
> Understanding and characterizing the subspaces of adversarial examples aid in studying the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial perturbations. Very recently, Ma et al. (ICLR 2018) proposed to use local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) in layer-wise hidden representations of DNNs to study adversarial subspaces. It was demonstrated that LID can be used to characterize the adversarial subspaces associated with different attack methods, e.g., the Carlini and Wagner's (C&amp;W) attack and the fast gradient sign attack. <br />In this paper, we use MNIST and CIFAR-10 to conduct two new sets of experiments that are absent in existing LID analysis and report the limitation of LID in characterizing the corresponding adversarial subspaces, which are (i) oblivious attacks and LID analysis using adversarial examples with different confidence levels; and (ii) black-box transfer attacks. For (i), we find that the performance of LID is very sensitive to the confidence parameter deployed by an attack, and the LID learned from ensembles of adversarial examples with varying confidence levels surprisingly gives poor performance. For (ii), we find that when adversarial examples are crafted from another DNN model, LID is ineffective in characterizing their adversarial subspaces. These two findings together suggest the limited capability of LID in characterizing the subspaces of adversarial examples. 
### 703.A disciplined approach to neural network hyper-parameters: Part 1 --  learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09820.pdf)
> Although deep learning has produced dazzling successes for applications of image, speech, and video processing in the past few years, most trainings are with suboptimal hyper-parameters, requiring unnecessarily long training times. Setting the hyper-parameters remains a black art that requires years of experience to acquire. This report proposes several efficient ways to set the hyper-parameters that significantly reduce training time and improves performance. Specifically, this report shows how to examine the training validation/test loss function for subtle clues of underfitting and overfitting and suggests guidelines for moving toward the optimal balance point. Then it discusses how to increase/decrease the learning rate/momentum to speed up training. Our experiments show that it is crucial to balance every manner of regularization for each dataset and architecture. Weight decay is used as a sample regularizer to show how its optimal value is tightly coupled with the learning rates and momentums. Files to help replicate the results reported here are available. 
### 704.Learning Synergies between Pushing and Grasping with Self-supervised  Deep Reinforcement Learning [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09956.pdf)
> Skilled robotic manipulation benefits from complex synergies between non-prehensile (e.g. pushing) and prehensile (e.g. grasping) actions: pushing can help rearrange cluttered objects to make space for arms and fingers; likewise, grasping can help displace objects to make pushing movements more precise and collision-free. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to discover and learn these synergies from scratch through model-free deep reinforcement learning. Our method involves training two fully convolutional networks that map from visual observations to actions: one infers the utility of pushes for a dense pixel-wise sampling of end effector orientations and locations, while the other does the same for grasping. Both networks are trained jointly in a Q-learning framework and are entirely self-supervised by trial and error, where rewards are provided from successful grasps. In this way, our policy learns pushing motions that enable future grasps, while learning grasps that can leverage past pushes. During picking experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we find that our system quickly learns complex behaviors amid challenging cases of clutter, and achieves better grasping success rates and picking efficiencies than baseline alternatives after only a few hours of training. We further demonstrate that our method is capable of generalizing to novel objects. Qualitative results (videos), code, pre-trained models, and simulation environments are available at <a href="http://vpg.cs.princeton.edu">this http URL</a> 
### 705.Normalization of Neural Networks using Analytic Variance Propagation [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10560.pdf)
> We address the problem of estimating statistics of hidden units in a neural network using a method of analytic moment propagation. These statistics are useful for approximate whitening of the inputs in front of saturating non-linearities such as a sigmoid function. This is important for initialization of training and for reducing the accumulated scale and bias dependencies (compensating covariate shift), which presumably eases the learning. In batch normalization, which is currently a very widely applied technique, sample estimates of statistics of hidden units over a batch are used. The proposed estimation uses an analytic propagation of mean and variance of the training set through the network. The result depends on the network structure and its current weights but not on the specific batch input. The estimates are suitable for initialization and normalization, efficient to compute and independent of the batch size. The experimental verification well supports these claims. However, the method does not share the generalization properties of BN, to which our experiments give some additional insight. 
### 706.Intertwiners between Induced Representations (with Applications to the  Theory of Equivariant Neural Networks) [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10743.pdf)
> Group equivariant and steerable convolutional neural networks (regular and steerable G-CNNs) have recently emerged as a very effective model class for learning from signal data such as 2D and 3D images, video, and other data where symmetries are present. In geometrical terms, regular G-CNNs represent data in terms of scalar fields ("feature channels"), whereas the steerable G-CNN can also use vector or tensor fields ("capsules") to represent data. In algebraic terms, the feature spaces in regular G-CNNs transform according to a regular representation of the group G, whereas the feature spaces in Steerable G-CNNs transform according to the more general induced representations of G. In order to make the network equivariant, each layer in a G-CNN is required to intertwine between the induced representations associated with its input and output space. <br />In this paper we present a general mathematical framework for G-CNNs on homogeneous spaces like Euclidean space or the sphere. We show, using elementary methods, that the layers of an equivariant network are convolutional if and only if the input and output feature spaces transform according to an induced representation. This result, which follows from G.W. Mackey's abstract theory on induced representations, establishes G-CNNs as a universal class of equivariant network architectures, and generalizes the important recent work of Kondor &amp; Trivedi on the intertwiners between regular representations. 
### 707.Detection of Structural Change in Geographic Regions of Interest by Self  Organized Mapping: Las Vegas City and Lake Mead across the Years [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11125.pdf)
> Time-series of satellite images may reveal important data about changes in environmental conditions and natural or urban landscape structures that are of potential interest to citizens, historians, or policymakers. We applied a fast method of image analysis using Self Organized Maps (SOM) and, more specifically, the quantization error (QE), for the visualization of critical changes in satellite images of Las Vegas, generated across the years 1984-2008, a period of major restructuration of the urban landscape. As shown in our previous work, the QE from the SOM output is a reliable measure of variability in local image contents. In the present work, we use statistical trend analysis to show how the QE from SOM run on specific geographic regions of interest extracted from satellite images can be exploited to detect both the magnitude and the direction of structural change across time at a glance. Significantly correlated demographic data for the same reference time period are highlighted. The approach is fast and reliable, and can be implemented for the rapid detection of potentially critical changes in time series of large bodies of image data. 
### 708.Detection, localisation and tracking of pallets using machine learning  techniques and 2D range data [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11254.pdf)
> The problem of autonomous transportation in industrial scenarios is receiving a renewed interest due to the way it can revolutionise internal logistics, especially in unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel architecture allowing a robot to detect, localise, and track multiple pallets using machine learning techniques based on an on-board 2D laser rangefinder. The architecture is composed of two main components: the first stage is a pallet detector employing a Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) detector cascaded with a CNN-based classifier; the second stage is a Kalman filter for localising and tracking detected pallets, which we also use to defer commitment to a pallet detected in the first step until sufficient confidence has been acquired via a sequential data acquisition process. For fine-tuning the CNNs, the architecture has been systematically evaluated using a real-world dataset containing 340 labeled 2D scans, which have been made freely available in an online repository. Detection performance has been assessed on the basis of the average accuracy over k-fold cross-validation, and it scored 99.58% in our tests. Concerning pallet localisation and tracking, experiments have been performed in a scenario where the robot is approaching the pallet to fork. Although data have been originally acquired by considering only one pallet, artificial data have been generated as well to mimic the presence of multiple targets in the robot workspace. Our experimental results confirm that the system is capable of identifying, localising and tracking pallets with a high success rate while being robust to false positives. 
### 709.FutureMapping: The Computational Structure of Spatial AI Systems [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11288.pdf)
> We discuss and predict the evolution of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) into a general geometric and semantic `Spatial AI' perception capability for intelligent embodied devices. A big gap remains between the visual perception performance that devices such as augmented reality eyewear or comsumer robots will require and what is possible within the constraints imposed by real products. Co-design of algorithms, processors and sensors will be needed. We explore the computational structure of current and future Spatial AI algorithms and consider this within the landscape of ongoing hardware developments. 
### 710.On the Resistance of Neural Nets to Label Noise [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11410.pdf)
> We investigate the behavior of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in the presence of label noise. We show empirically that CNN prediction for a given test sample depends on the labels of the training samples in its local neighborhood. This is similar to the way that the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) classifier works. With this understanding, we derive an analytical expression for the expected accuracy of a K-NN, and hence a CNN, classifier for any level of noise. In particular, we show that K-NN, and CNN, are resistant to label noise that is randomly spread across the training set, but are very sensitive to label noise that is concentrated. Experiments on real datasets validate our analytical expression by showing that they match the empirical results for varying degrees of label noise. 
### 711.PDE-constrained optimization in medical image analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00058.pdf)
> PDE-constrained optimization problems find many applications in medical image analysis, for example, neuroimaging, cardiovascular imaging, and oncological imaging. We review related literature and give examples on the formulation, discretization, and numerical solution of PDE-constrained optimization problems for medical imaging. We discuss three examples. The first one is image registration. The second one is data assimilation for brain tumor patients, and the third one data assimilation in cardiovascular imaging. The image registration problem is a classical task in medical image analysis and seeks to find pointwise correspondences between two or more images. The data assimilation problems use a PDE-constrained formulation to link a biophysical model to patient-specific data obtained from medical images. The associated optimality systems turn out to be sets of nonlinear, multicomponent PDEs that are challenging to solve in an efficient way. <br />The ultimate goal of our work is the design of inversion methods that integrate complementary data, and rigorously follow mathematical and physical principles, in an attempt to support clinical decision making. This requires reliable, high-fidelity algorithms with a short time-to-solution. This task is complicated by model and data uncertainties, and by the fact that PDE-constrained optimization problems are ill-posed in nature, and in general yield high-dimensional, severely ill-conditioned systems after discretization. These features make regularization, effective preconditioners, and iterative solvers that, in many cases, have to be implemented on distributed-memory architectures to be practical, a prerequisite. We showcase state-of-the-art techniques in scientific computing to tackle these challenges. 
### 712.Genaue modellbasierte Identifikation von gyn&#xe4;kologischen  Katheterpfaden f&#xfc;r die MRT-bildgest&#xfc;tzte Brachytherapie [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00492.pdf)
> German text, english abstract: Mortality in gynecologic cancers, including cervical, ovarian, vaginal and vulvar cancers, is more than 6% internationally [1]. In many countries external radiotherapy is supplemented by brachytherapy with high locally administered doses as standard. The superior ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate soft tissue has led to an increasing use of this imaging technique in the intraoperative planning and implementation of brachytherapy. A technical challenge associated with the use of MRI imaging for brachytherapy - in contrast to computed tomography (CT) imaging - is the dark-diffuse appearance and thus difficult identification of the catheter paths in the resulting images. This problem is addressed by the precise method described herein of tracing the catheters from the catheter tip. The average identification time for a single catheter path was three seconds on a standard PC. Segmentation time, accuracy and precision are promising indicators of the value of this method for the clinical application of image-guided gynecological brachytherapy. After surgery (OP), the healthy surrounding tissue of the tumor is usually irradiated. This reduces the risk of leaving behind residual cells that would likely cause a recurrence of the cancer or the formation of metastases - secondary tumors elsewhere in the body. In the case of a tumor on the cervix or prostate, the operation is minimally invasive, ie. the removal of the cancer and the irradiation are performed cost-effectively and risk-avoiding by keyhole surgery instead of open surgery. 
### 713.Natural data structure extracted from neighborhood-similarity graphs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00500.pdf)
> 'Big' high-dimensional data are commonly analyzed in low-dimensions, after performing a dimensionality-reduction step that inherently distorts the data structure. For the same purpose, clustering methods are also often used. These methods also introduce a bias, either by starting from the assumption of a particular geometric form of the clusters, or by using iterative schemes to enhance cluster contours, with uncontrollable consequences. The goal of data analysis should, however, be to encode and detect structural data features at all scales and densities simultaneously, without assuming a parametric form of data point distances, or modifying them. We propose a novel approach that directly encodes data point neighborhood similarities as a sparse graph. Our non-iterative framework permits a transparent interpretation of data, without altering the original data dimension and metric. Several natural and synthetic data applications demonstrate the efficacy of our novel approach. 
### 714.Fast and accurate computation of orthogonal moments for texture analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00638.pdf)
> In this work we describe a fast and stable algorithm for the computation of the orthogonal moments of an image. Indeed, orthogonal moments are characterized by a high discriminative power, but some of their possible formulations are characterized by a large computational complexity, which limits their real-time application. This paper describes in detail an approach based on recurrence relations, and proposes an optimized Matlab implementation of the corresponding computational procedure, aiming to solve the above limitations and put at the community's disposal an efficient and easy to use software. In our experiments we evaluate the effectiveness of the recurrence formulation, as well as its performance for the reconstruction task, in comparison to the closed form representation, often used in the literature. The results show a sensible reduction in the computational complexity, together with a greater accuracy in reconstruction. In order to assess and compare the accuracy of the computed moments in texture analysis, we perform classification experiments on six well-known databases of texture images. Again, the recurrence formulation performs better in classification than the closed form representation. More importantly, if computed from the GLCM of the image using the proposed stable procedure, the orthogonal moments outperform in some situations some of the most diffused state-of-the-art descriptors for texture classification. 
### 715.Deep-neural-network based sinogram synthesis for sparse-view CT image  reconstruction [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00694.pdf)
> Recently, a number of approaches to low-dose computed tomography (CT) have been developed and deployed in commercialized CT scanners. Tube current reduction is perhaps the most actively explored technology with advanced image reconstruction algorithms. Sparse data sampling is another viable option to the low-dose CT, and sparse-view CT has been particularly of interest among the researchers in CT community. Since analytic image reconstruction algorithms would lead to severe image artifacts, various iterative algorithms have been developed for reconstructing images from sparsely view-sampled projection data. However, iterative algorithms take much longer computation time than the analytic algorithms, and images are usually prone to different types of image artifacts that heavily depend on the reconstruction parameters. Interpolation methods have also been utilized to fill the missing data in the sinogram of sparse-view CT thus providing synthetically full data for analytic image reconstruction. In this work, we introduce a deep-neural-network-enabled sinogram synthesis method for sparse-view CT, and show its outperformance to the existing interpolation methods and also to the iterative image reconstruction approach. 
### 716.Driving Digital Rock towards Machine Learning: predicting permeability  with Gradient Boosting and Deep Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00758.pdf)
> We present a research study aimed at testing of applicability of machine learning techniques for prediction of permeability of digitized rock samples. We prepare a training set containing 3D images of sandstone samples imaged with X-ray microtomography and corresponding permeability values simulated with Pore Network approach. We also use Minkowski functionals and Deep Learning-based descriptors of 3D images and 2D slices as input features for predictive model training and prediction. We compare predictive power of various feature sets and methods. The later include Gradient Boosting and various architectures of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The results demonstrate applicability of machine learning for image-based permeability prediction and open a new area of Digital Rock research. 
### 717.Quantum distance-based classifier with constant size memory, distributed  knowledge and state recycling [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00853.pdf)
> In this work we examine recently proposed distance-based classification method designed for near-term quantum processing units with limited resources. We further study possibilities to reduce the quantum resources without any efficiency decrease. We show that only a part of the information undergoes coherent evolution and this fact allows us to introduce an algorithm with significantly reduced quantum memory size. Additionally, considering only partial information at a time, we propose a classification protocol with information distributed among a number of agents. Finally, we show that the information evolution during a measurement can lead to a better solution and that accuracy of the algorithm can be improved by harnessing the state after the final measurement. 
### 718.Enhancement of land-use change modeling using convolutional neural  networks and convolutional denoising autoencoders [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01159.pdf)
> The neighborhood effect is a key driving factor for the land-use change (LUC) process. This study applies convolutional neural networks (CNN) to capture neighborhood characteristics from satellite images and to enhance the performance of LUC modeling. We develop a hybrid CNN model (conv-net) to predict the LU transition probability by combining satellite images and geographical features. A spatial weight layer is designed to incorporate the distance-decay characteristics of neighborhood effect into conv-net. As an alternative model, we also develop a hybrid convolutional denoising autoencoder and multi-layer perceptron model (CDAE-net), which specifically learns latent representations from satellite images and denoises the image data. Finally, a DINAMICA-based cellular automata (CA) model simulates the LU pattern. The results show that the convolutional-based models improve the modeling performances compared with a model that accepts only the geographical features. Overall, conv-net outperforms CDAE-net in terms of LUC predictive performance. Nonetheless, CDAE-net performs better when the data are noisy. 
### 719.Nonlocality-Reinforced Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Denoising [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02112.pdf)
> We introduce a paradigm for nonlocal sparsity reinforced deep convolutional neural network denoising. It is a combination of a local multiscale denoising by a convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoiser and a nonlocal denoising based on a nonlocal filter (NLF) exploiting the mutual similarities between groups of patches. CNN models are leveraged with noise levels that progressively decrease at every iteration of our framework, while their output is regularized by a nonlocal prior implicit within the NLF. Unlike complicated neural networks that embed the nonlocality prior within the layers of the network, our framework is modular, it uses standard pre-trained CNNs together with standard nonlocal filters. An instance of the proposed framework, called NN3D, is evaluated over large grayscale image datasets showing state-of-the-art performance. 
### 720.Contour Parametrization via Anisotropic Mean Curvature Flows [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03724.pdf)
> We present a new implementation of anisotropic mean curvature flow for contour recognition. Our procedure couples the mean curvature flow of planar closed smooth curves, with an external field from a potential of point-wise charges. This coupling constrains the motion when the curve matches a picture placed as background. We include a stability criteria for our numerical approximation. 
### 721.Fire detection in a still image using colour information [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03828.pdf)
> Colour analysis is a crucial step in image-based fire detection algorithms. Many of the proposed fire detection algorithms in a still image are prone to false alarms caused by objects with a colour similar to fire. To design a colour-based system with a better false alarm rate, a new colour-differentiating conversion matrix, efficient on images of high colour complexity, is proposed. The elements of this conversion matrix are obtained by performing K-medoids clustering and Particle Swarm Optimisation procedures on a fire sample image with a background of high fire-colour similarity. The proposed conversion matrix is then used to construct two new fire colour detection frameworks. The first detection method is a two-stage non-linear image transformation framework, while the second is a direct transformation of an image with the proposed conversion matrix. A performance comparison of the proposed methods with alternate methods in the literature was carried out. Experimental results indicate that the linear image transformation method outperforms other methods regarding false alarm rate while the non-linear two-stage image transformation method has the best performance on the F-score metric and provides a better trade-off between missed detection and false alarm rate. 
### 722.Automated non-mass enhancing lesion detection and segmentation in breast  DCE-MRI [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04200.pdf)
> Non-mass enhancing lesions (NME) constitute a diagnostic challenge in dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of the breast. Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems provide physicians with advanced tools for analysis, assessment and evaluation that have a significant impact on the diagnostic performance. Here, we propose a new approach for the specific problem of NME detection and segmentation, by taking advantage of independent component analysis (ICA) to extract a data-driven dynamic characterization of tissue. A set of independent sources was obtained from a dataset of patients, and the dynamic behavior of the different tissues was described by multiple dynamic curves, together with a set of eigenimages describing the scores for each voxel. A new test image is projected onto the independent source space using the unmixing matrix, and each voxel is classified by a support vector machine (SVM) that has already been trained with manually delineated data. A solution to the high false positive rate problem is proposed by controlling the SVM hyperplane location. The CAD system is trained and validated, reaching a DSC coefficient of 0.7215 for NME segmentation. 
### 723.Measuring Conflict in a Multi-Source Environment as a Normal Measure [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04556.pdf)
> In a multi-source environment, each source has its own credibility. If there is no external knowledge about credibility then we can use the information provided by the sources to assess their credibility. In this paper, we propose a way to measure conflict in a multi-source environment as a normal measure. We examine our algorithm using three simulated examples of increasing conflict and one experimental example. The results demonstrate that the proposed measure can represent conflict in a meaningful way similar to what a human might expect and from it we can identify conflict within our sources. 
### 724.Image Segmentation and Processing for Efficient Parking Space Analysis [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04620.pdf)
> In this paper, we develop a method to detect vacant parking spaces in an environment with unclear segments and contours with the help of MATLAB image processing capabilities. Due to the anomalies present in the parking spaces, such as uneven illumination, distorted slot lines and overlapping of cars. The present-day conventional algorithms have difficulties processing the image for accurate results. The algorithm proposed uses a combination of image pre-processing and false contour detection techniques to improve the detection efficiency. The proposed method also eliminates the need to employ individual sensors to detect a car, instead uses real-time static images to consider a group of slots together, instead of the usual single slot method. This greatly decreases the expenses required to design an efficient parking system. We compare the performance of our algorithm to that of other techniques. These comparisons show that the proposed algorithm can detect the vacancies in the parking spots while ignoring the false data and other distortions. 
### 725.Towards Monocular Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Estimation by  Convolutional Neural Networks - Application on Synthetic Aperture Radar  Images [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05387.pdf)
> Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) is performed using repeat-pass geometry. InSAR technique is used to estimate the topographic reconstruction of the earth surface. The main problem of the range-Doppler focusing technique is the nature of the two-dimensional SAR result, affected by the layover indetermination. In order to resolve this problem, a minimum of two sensor acquisitions, separated by a baseline and extended in the cross-slant-range, are needed. However, given its multi-temporal nature, these techniques are vulnerable to atmosphere and Earth environment parameters variation in addition to physical platform instabilities. Furthermore, either two radars are needed or an interferometric cycle is required (that spans from days to weeks), which makes real time DEM estimation impossible. In this work, the authors propose a novel experimental alternative to the InSAR method that uses single-pass acquisitions, using a data driven approach implemented by Deep Neural Networks. We propose a fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Encoder-Decoder architecture, training it on radar images in order to estimate DEMs from single pass image acquisitions. Our results on a set of Sentinel images show that this method is able to learn to some extent the statistical properties of the DEM. The results of this exploratory analysis are encouraging and open the way to the solution of single-pass DEM estimation problem with data driven approaches. 
### 726.2D Reconstruction of Small Intestine&#x27;s Interior Wall [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05817.pdf)
> Examining and interpreting of a large number of wireless endoscopic images from the gastrointestinal tract is a tiresome task for physicians. A practical solution is to automatically construct a two dimensional representation of the gastrointestinal tract for easy inspection. However, little has been done on wireless endoscopic image stitching, let alone systematic investigation. The proposed new wireless endoscopic image stitching method consists of two main steps to improve the accuracy and efficiency of image registration. First, the keypoints are extracted by Principle Component Analysis and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (PCA-SIFT) algorithm and refined with Maximum Likelihood Estimation SAmple Consensus (MLESAC) outlier removal to find the most reliable keypoints. Second, the optimal transformation parameters obtained from first step are fed to the Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) algorithm as an initial solution. With modified Marquardt-Levenberg search strategy in a multiscale framework, the NMI can find the optimal transformation parameters in the shortest time. The proposed methodology has been tested on two different datasets - one with real wireless endoscopic images and another with images obtained from Micro-Ball (a new wireless cubic endoscopy system with six image sensors). The results have demonstrated the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology both visually and quantitatively. 
### 727.Adaptive Polar Active Contour for Segmentation and Tracking in  Ultrasound Videos [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07195.pdf)
> Detection of relative changes in circulating blood volume is important to guide resuscitation and manage a variety of medical conditions including sepsis, trauma, dialysis and congestive heart failure. Recent studies have shown that estimates of circulating blood volume can be obtained from the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the internal jugular vein (IJV) from ultrasound images. However, accurate segmentation and tracking of the IJV in ultrasound imaging is a challenging task and is significantly influenced by a number of parameters such as the image quality, shape, and temporal variation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive polar active contour (Ad-PAC) algorithm for the segmentation and tracking of the IJV in ultrasound videos. In the proposed algorithm, the parameters of the Ad-PAC algorithm are adapted based on the results of segmentation in previous frames. The Ad-PAC algorithm is applied to 65 ultrasound videos captured from 13 healthy subjects, with each video containing 450 frames. The results show that spatial and temporal adaptation of the energy function significantly improves segmentation performance when compared to current state-of-the-art active contour algorithms. 
### 728.Product Characterisation towards Personalisation: Learning Attributes  from Unstructured Data to Recommend Fashion Products [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07679.pdf)
> In this paper, we describe a solution to tackle a common set of challenges in e-commerce, which arise from the fact that new products are continually being added to the catalogue. The challenges involve properly personalising the customer experience, forecasting demand and planning the product range. We argue that the foundational piece to solve all of these problems is having consistent and detailed information about each product, information that is rarely available or consistent given the multitude of suppliers and types of products. We describe in detail the architecture and methodology implemented at ASOS, one of the world's largest fashion e-commerce retailers, to tackle this problem. We then show how this quantitative understanding of the products can be leveraged to improve recommendations in a hybrid recommender system approach. 
### 729.Positive-unlabeled convolutional neural networks for particle picking in  cryo-electron micrographs [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08207.pdf)
> Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is fast becoming the preferred method for protein structure determination. Particle picking is a significant bottleneck in the solving of protein structures from single particle cryoEM. Hand labeling sufficient numbers of particles can take months of effort and current computationally based approaches are often ineffective. Here, we frame particle picking as a positive-unlabeled classification problem in which we seek to learn a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify micrograph regions as particle or background from a small number of labeled positive examples and many unlabeled examples. However, model fitting with very few labeled data points is a challenging machine learning problem. To address this, we develop a novel objective function, GE-binomial, for learning model parameters in this context. This objective uses a newly-formulated generalized expectation criteria to learn effectively from unlabeled data when using minibatched stochastic gradient descent optimizers. On a high-quality publicly available cryoEM dataset and a difficult unpublished dataset supplied by the Shapiro lab, we show that CNNs trained with this objective classify particles accurately with very few positive training examples and outperform EMAN2's byRef method by a large margin even with fewer labeled training examples. Furthermore, we show that incorporating an autoencoder improves generalization when very few labeled data points are available. We also compare our GE-binomial method with other positive-unlabeled learning methods never before applied to particle picking. We expect our particle picking tool, Topaz, based on CNNs trained with GE-binomial, to be an essential component of single particle cryoEM analysis and our GE-binomial objective function to be widely applicable to positive-unlabeled classification problems. 
### 730.DeepDRR -- A Catalyst for Machine Learning in Fluoroscopy-guided  Procedures [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08606.pdf)
> Machine learning-based approaches outperform competing methods in most disciplines relevant to diagnostic radiology. Interventional radiology, however, has not yet benefited substantially from the advent of deep learning, in particular because of two reasons: 1) Most images acquired during the procedure are never archived and are thus not available for learning, and 2) even if they were available, annotations would be a severe challenge due to the vast amounts of data. When considering fluoroscopy-guided procedures, an interesting alternative to true interventional fluoroscopy is in silico simulation of the procedure from 3D diagnostic CT. In this case, labeling is comparably easy and potentially readily available, yet, the appropriateness of resulting synthetic data is dependent on the forward model. In this work, we propose DeepDRR, a framework for fast and realistic simulation of fluoroscopy and digital radiography from CT scans, tightly integrated with the software platforms native to deep learning. We use machine learning for material decomposition and scatter estimation in 3D and 2D, respectively, combined with analytic forward projection and noise injection to achieve the required performance. On the example of anatomical landmark detection in X-ray images of the pelvis, we demonstrate that machine learning models trained on DeepDRRs generalize to unseen clinically acquired data without the need for re-training or domain adaptation. Our results are promising and promote the establishment of machine learning in fluoroscopy-guided procedures. 
### 731.Classification of simulated radio signals using Wide Residual Networks  for use in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08624.pdf)
> We describe a new approach and algorithm for the detection of artificial signals and their classification in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). The characteristics of radio signals observed during SETI research are often most apparent when those signals are represented as spectrograms. Additionally, many observed signals tend to share the same characteristics, allowing for sorting of the signals into different classes. For this work, complex-valued time-series data were simulated to produce a corpus of 140,000 signals from seven different signal classes. A wide residual neural network was then trained to classify these signal types using the gray-scale 2D spectrogram representation of those signals. An average $F_1$ score of 95.11\% was attained when tested on previously unobserved simulated signals. We also report on the performance of the model across a range of signal amplitudes. 
### 732.Image-based deep learning for classification of noise transients in  gravitational wave detectors [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09933.pdf)
> The detection of gravitational waves has inaugurated the era of gravitational astronomy and opened new avenues for the multimessenger study of cosmic sources. Thanks to their sensitivity, the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo interferometers will probe a much larger volume of space and expand the capability of discovering new gravitational wave emitters. The characterization of these detectors is a primary task in order to recognize the main sources of noise and optimize the sensitivity of interferometers. Glitches are transient noise events that can impact the data quality of the interferometers and their classification is an important task for detector characterization. Deep learning techniques are a promising tool for the recognition and classification of glitches. We present a classification pipeline that exploits convolutional neural networks to classify glitches starting from their time-frequency evolution represented as images. We evaluated the classification accuracy on simulated glitches, showing that the proposed algorithm can automatically classify glitches on very fast timescales and with high accuracy, thus providing a promising tool for online detector characterization. 
### 733.Kinetic Compressive Sensing [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10045.pdf)
> Parametric images provide insight into the spatial distribution of physiological parameters, but they are often extremely noisy, due to low SNR of tomographic data. Direct estimation from projections allows accurate noise modeling, improving the results of post-reconstruction fitting. We propose a method, which we name kinetic compressive sensing (KCS), based on a hierarchical Bayesian model and on a novel reconstruction algorithm, that encodes sparsity of kinetic parameters. Parametric maps are reconstructed by maximizing the joint probability, with an Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) approach, alternating the optimization of activity time series (OS-MAP-OSL), and kinetic parameters (MAP-LM). We evaluated the proposed algorithm on a simulated dynamic phantom: a bias/variance study confirmed how direct estimates can improve the quality of parametric maps over a post-reconstruction fitting, and showed how the novel sparsity prior can further reduce their variance, without affecting bias. Real FDG PET human brain data (Siemens mMR, 40min) images were also processed. Results enforced how the proposed KCS-regularized direct method can produce spatially coherent images and parametric maps, with lower spatial noise and better tissue contrast. A GPU-based open source implementation of the algorithm is provided. 
### 734.Feed-forward Uncertainty Propagation in Belief and Neural Networks [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10590.pdf)
> We propose a feed-forward inference method applicable to belief and neural networks. In a belief network, the method estimates an approximate factorized posterior of all hidden units given the input. In neural networks the method propagates uncertainty of the input through all the layers. In neural networks with injected noise, the method analytically takes into account uncertainties resulting from this noise. Such feed-forward analytic propagation is differentiable in parameters and can be trained end-to-end. Compared to standard NN, which can be viewed as propagating only the means, we propagate the mean and variance. The method can be useful in all scenarios that require knowledge of the neuron statistics, e.g. when dealing with uncertain inputs, considering sigmoid activations as probabilities of Bernoulli units, training the models regularized by injected noise (dropout) or estimating activation statistics over the dataset (as needed for normalization methods). In the experiments we show the possible utility of the method in all these tasks as well as its current limitations.
